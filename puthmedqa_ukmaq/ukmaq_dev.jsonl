        "answer": "DE",
        "explanation": "The majority of prolactin-secreting pituitary tumours are microadenomas. If followed over many years, most are static in size; 25% regress; 25% expand (especially with pregnancy). Men commonly present with reduced libido and impotence while women present with menstrual irregularity, amenorrhoea, infertility or galactorrhoea. Impaired GnRH secretion causes low sex hormones and this may lead to osteoporosis. Treatment depends on size and symptoms. Bromocriptine is a partial agonist at dopamine receptors and inhibits prolactin release from the tumour cells. If there are local pressure effects (falling visual acuity), surgery is recommended. "

        "explanation": "The aetiology of Paget's disease is still unknown. There is increased remodelling of bone with areas of bone deposition (sclerosis) and areas of resorption. Enlarged bones are painful and easily fractured. There is an increased risk of osteogenic sarcoma in both sclerotic and porotic areas. Treatment is with analgesics, disodium etidronate (to reduce bone turnover) or calcitonin (derived from salmon; side effects include flushing, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting; may develop resistance due to antibodies to the foreign protein).

        "explanation": "Selective IgA deficiency is commonly sporadic and not inherited (incidence 1:600). Clinical features vary from asymptomatic (incidental finding) to recurrent chest infections and bronchiectasis and chronic diarrhoeal disease similar ro coeliac disease. There is an increased incidence of other autoimmune disorders, e.g. SLE, chronic active hepatitis, RA, thyroiditis and pernicious anaemia. There may be an associated IgG subclass deficiency, but levels of IgG and IgM are usually normal. Intravenous immunoglobulin is not the preferred treatment as low quantities of IgA in the preparation may trigger an anaphylactic reaction. X-linked recessive immunodeficiency syndromes include Bruton's agammaglobulinaemia, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome and chronic granulomatous disease. "

        "answer": "AD",
        "explanation": "The commonest presentation of motor neurone disease is upper limb fasiculation and spastic gait (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis). 25% of patients have mainly lower motor neurone changes (progressive muscular atrophy) and carry a better prognosis. 25% present with progressive bulbar palsy and either flaccid, spastic or combined bulbar symptoms. Patients in this group usually die before their limbs are involved. There is no effective therapy (beta-IFN is used for selected patients with multiple sclerosis). Recently, riluzole (an `anti-excitotoxic agent') has been reported to prolong tracheostomy-free survival in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, slow the deterioration in muscle strength and prolong survival. However, only 2 randomised trials have been reported and further data is awaited. There are usually no sensory symptoms (rarely, subclinical involvement is seen on nerve conduction studies) and it never affects extra-ocular movements (III, IV and VI). "

Its effect on the AV node is to increase the refractory period and slow the heart rate, which makes it useful for treating SVTs. Nifedipine is not licensed for use in pregnancy. There are some reports of teratogenicity in animals but not humans. Other causes of gum hypertrophy include cyclosporin, chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia and phenytoin.

        "explanation": "ANCA (anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) is a marker of systemic vasculitis (e.g. Wegener's, rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, Kawasaki disease and Churg-Strauss syndrome). This may be divided into pANCA and cANCA on the basis of the staining pattern. These have distinct antigen specificities: pANCA (peri-nuclear) reacts against myeloperoxidase or elastase and is rarely seen in Wegener's disease. It may occur with severe infections (HIV, infective endocarditis, amoebic abscesses, etc.), inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, Crohn's), malignancy, primary biliary cirrhosis, anti-GBM disease, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis; cANCA recognises neutrophil alpha-proteinase-3 and >80% of patients with Wegener's are positive for this. It is also seen in microscopic polyarteritis. The ANCA has not yet been shown to be pathogenic but the levels mimic the disease activity. Patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome may have either form of ANCA - 25% are pANCA positive, 50% cANCA positive and the rest are ANCA negative. "

There is recent evidence that a novel Herpes virus (HHV-8) may be involved in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and can be detected by PCR in these lesions.

        "explanation": "Aminoglycoside-induced renal failure typically takes days to manifest and it may take months to recover renal function. Analgesic nephropathy is a chronic interstitial nephritis with papillary necrosis initially recognised in patients taking the NSAID phenacitin. It can result in chronic renal failure, recurrent UTIs, renal calculi and defects in urine acidification and sodium excretion. Patients have an increased risk of transitional cell carcinoma of the uroepithelium. Amiloride inhibits a sodium channel in the collecting duct and so decreases acid secretion. Other diuretics promote loss of sodium and chloride and may also result in acidosis. Light-chain nephropathy may occur with multiple myeloma but is also seen with lymphomas. Medullary sponge kidney disease is characterised by dilatation of the renal collecting tubules. Features include hypercalciuria, renal calculi, recurrent UTIs and haematuria. Renal failure is rare. "

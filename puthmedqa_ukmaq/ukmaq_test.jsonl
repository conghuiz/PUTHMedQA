        "explanation": "Theophylline poisoning produces vomiting, restlessness and agitation, tachycardia, dilated pupils, haematemesis and tachyarrhythmias. Hypokalaemia and hyperglycaemia may be found. Elimination may be enhanced by activated charcoal. Correction of hypokalaemia is effective in reducing the risk of tachyarrhythmias. Other drugs effectively cleared by charcoal include aspirin, carbamazepine, dapsone, phenobarbitone and quinine. Haemodialysis is effective in removing salicylates, phenobarbitone, methanol, ethylene glycol and lithium. Forced alkaline diuresis is no longer recommended for salicylates and bicarbonate infusion is as effective. Haemodialysis is effective for salicylates. Tricyclics delay gastric emptying time and thus gastric lavage should still be attempted. "

        "answer": "AC",
        "explanation": "Renin is released from the juxtaglomerular apparatus in response to decrease in renal blood flow (e.g. pressure changes in the afferent arteriole, sympathetic tone within the renal arterioles), increased chloride (low Na) and osmotic changes in the distal tubule via macula densa and local prostaglandin synthesis. It converts angiotensinogen to angiotensin I; this is converted to angiotensin II by ACE (mainly in the lungs). Angiotensin II stimulates aldosterone release by the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex; other effects include peripheral vasoconstriction and stimulation of thirst. Increase in serum renin is seen in renal artery stenosis, congestive cardiac failure, hypovolaemia, hypotension, certain drugs (diuretics, ACE inhibitors, spironolactone) and Addison's disease. Serum renin is reduced by beta-blocker therapy, ANP or angiotensin II infusion. Hypertension may be associated with a low, normal or high renin. "

        "explanation": "In patients with ischaemic heart disease, myocardial oxygen demand exceeds supply. With prolonged angina, there is impaired diastolic relaxation and eventually impaired systolic contraction resulting in overall reduction in left ventricular function. Clinical evidence of heart failure develops when the remainder of the normal myocardium is unable to maintain cardiac output. However, dyspnoea on exercise does not suggest severe left ventricular disease, but may just reflect severe reduction in exercise-induced vasodilatation and a limited residual coronary flow reserve. A fall in BP on exercise occurs for similar reasons. The patients may develop a third heart sound during episodes of angina as the ventricle is `stiffer'. Tachycardia from any cause can precipitate angina. "

Localized osteoporosis is seen in rheumatoid arthritis (periarticular), chronic renal failure and in patients receiving long-term intravenous heparin therapy. The mainstay of therapy is prevention of deterioration (e.g. oestrogen therapy for women postmenopause). Etidronate therapy increases bone density and reduces the incidence of fractures but needs to be given long-term for benefit. "

Quadriceps is paralysed and there is loss of extension of the knee joint. Deep peroneal nerve loss produces foot drop due to the unopposed action of tibialis posterior causing inversion of the foot. The only cutaneous loss is over the first interdigital cleft.

        "answer": "ACE",
        "explanation": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) have been shown to reduce mortality in congestive cardiac failure and following myocardial infarction. ACE inhibitors inhibit the conversion of angiotensin-I to angiotensin-II, a potent vasoconstrictor. They also result in inhibition of the feedback mechanisms which suppress plasma renin levels – thus plasma renin levels are greatly elevated in patients receiving ACE inhibitors. One form of secondary hypertension is glucocorticoid suppressible. In these patients the 5'regulatory region of 11-beta-hydroxylase is linked to aldosterone synthase. Suppression of ACTH by dexamethasone inhibits aldosterone synthesis and reduces blood pressure in these patients. Renal artery stenosis reduces the blood flow to the kidney and stimulates renin secretion. This in turn leads to high levels of angiotensin-II which drives the hypertension. Inhibition of angiotensin-II production using an ACE inhibitor will reduce blood pressure. "

In patients with atrial fibrillation or rheumatic valve disease, aspirin does reduce the risk of embolic stroke but anticoagulation with warfarin is preferable. Ticlopidine is a platelet antagonist that is more effective than aspirin but its side-effects (neutropenia in up to 10%) limit its use in the UK although it is widely used in Europe and the USA. Embolic strokes may benefit from anticoagulation and/or thrombolysis; warfarin is more effective than aspirin which is better than nothing.

Bone disease (cysts or fractures) may occur. Hypertension may occur and although initially due to hypercalcaemia, does not always respond to lowering the serum calcium level. Urinary calcium, cAMP and hydroxyproline excretion are all increased and there may be a mild hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. Most commonly due to a single adenoma (90%). MEN type I produces parathyroid hyperplasia in association with pituitary adenoma and pancreatic islet cell tumours.

        "answer": "BCD",
        "explanation": "T lymphocytes are divided into subtypes on the basis of cell-surface markers as well as functional characteristics. All T cells express CD3 on their surface; this is in close relation to the T cell receptor and is involved in T cell activation. CD4-positive T cells are termed helper T cells and are further divided into TH1 and TH2 on functional characteristics. TH1 cells primarily enhance immune responses and secrete IL-1, gamma-IFN, IL-12 and TNF. They promote T cell proliferation and macrophage activation. TH2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-13 and are involved primarily in enhancing humoral immune responses (B cell activation, Ig class switching, etc.). IL-15 has been shown to induce T cell activation and TNF production, especially in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. CD45RO is a cell-surface marker for memory T cells: these are the subgroup that circulates through the tissues screening for antigen. CD45RA is a marker for naive T cells. "

        "answer": "BCDE",
        "explanation": "Nephrotic syndrome causes a dilutional hyponatraemia. Hypopituitarism produces adrenal failure and so sodium depletion (low sodium with raised potassium and urea). Causes of hyponatraemia may be divided into pseudo- and true-hyponatraemia: 1. Pseudo-hyponatraemia: The presence of other agents in the plasma causes an apparent reduction in sodium, but the actual plasma sodium in the `plasma-water' compartment remains normal, e.g. hypertriglyceridaemia, raised gammaglobulins (e.g. myeloma), hyperglycaemia or another osmotic agent (mannitol, ethanol, etc.). 2. True-hyponatraemia: This may be due to sodium depletion or water excess. Sodium depletion may result from renal losses (e.g. diuretic excess, osmotic diuresis in hyperglycaemia, Addison's disease, intrinsic renal disease - nephrocalcinosis, medullary cystic disease), GI losses (e.g. diarrhoea, fistula losses, villous adenoma of colon, bowel obstruction) or skin losses (e.g. heat exposure with inadequate salt replacement). Water excess and dilutional hyponatraemia may be iatrogenic (over-replacement with 5% dextrose without saline) or due to cardiac failure, cirrhosis of the liver, nephritic syndrome, hypothyroidism and SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion). Causes of SIADH: Malignancy (small-cell lung cancer, pancreas, prostate, adrenal, lymphoma, leukaemia, etc.); intra-cranial causes (malignancy - primary or secondary, CVA, head injury, meningoencephalitis, abscess, intracranial haemorrhage, vasculitis, etc.); chest (pneumonia, TB, abscess, aspergillosis, etc.); drug-induced (e.g. chlorpropamide, opiates, phenothiazines, carbamazepine); and metabolic diseases (e.g. porphyria).

        "answer": "AE",
        "explanation": "Any cause of Cushing's syndrome results in loss of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion and produces a persistently elevated serum (and 24-hour urine) cortisol. Serum ACTH is undetectable with adrenal tumours; an exaggerated response to CRF administration is seen in pituitary-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Adrenal tumours usually do not suppress with dexamethasone (low or high dose). Metyrapone inhibits 11-beta-hydroxylase (a step in the synthesis of cortisol) and results in a loss in the negative feedback of cortisol on the pituitary. This produces a rise in ACTH secretion and a rise in urinary 17-oxogenic steroids (17-OGS). It may be used in the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome: in pituitary Cushing's, metyrapone produces a large rise in urinary 17-OGS while in ectopic ACTH secretion or adrenal tumours, although serum cortisol levels may fall, there is usually no change in urinary 17-OGS excretion. Prior to surgery, it is important to reduce cortisol levels to 300-400 nmol/l and metyrapone (or aminogluthemide) may be used. "

Other causes include iron deficiency and splenectomy. In myeloproliferative diseases, there may be autonomous production, e.g. chronic myeloid leukaemia (not CLL), polycythaemia rubra vera and essential thrombocytosis; in these conditions this may be associated with abnormal platelet function. (CLL causes an autoimmune thrombocytopenia.) Iron overload can be divided into primary (as in haemochromatosis) or secondary. Causes of acquired iron overload include ineffective erythropoiesis (e.g. thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, sideroblastic anaemia, etc. where iron overload is due to increased dietary absorption as well as blood transfusion). Minor degrees of iron overload are also seen in alcoholic liver disease and porphyria cutanea tarda For haemochromatosis, therapeutic venesection is an effective treatment; others require parenternal iron chelation therapy (desferrioxamine). Aplastic anaemia is characterised by peripheral blood pancytopenia due to bone marrow failure. About half are idiopathic. The commonest cause is drug/toxin-induced-chloramphenicol, sulphonamides, anticonvulsants, chlorpropamide, propylthiouracil, carbimazole, phenothiazines, aspirin, gold compounds, D-penicillamine, carbon tetrachloride, benzene, DDT and radiation. Other causes include infection (e.g. hepatitis C, parvovirus, tuberculosis, rarely CMV or EBV). Fanconi's anaemia is a congenital disorder with hypoplastic kidneys, hypoplastic thumb and radii, microcephaly and mental retardation. Down's syndrome carries an increased risk of acute myeloid leukaemia, not aplastic anaemia. Erythrocytosis has been associated with renal cysts, hydronephrosis, nephrotic syndrome, diffuse renal parenchymal disease and Bartter's syndrome and is seen in up to 15% of renal transplant recipients. Other causes of secondary erythrocytosis include smoking, chronic pulmonary disease, cyanotic heart disease, Pickwickian syndrome, high altitude, adrenal cortical hypersecretion and occasionally with exogenous androgen therapy.

It leaves the orbit through the optic canal and passes into the middle cranial fossa medial to the internal carotid artery. It is separated from the pituitary by the cavernous sinuses and the diaphragma sellae. The lingual nerve carries general sensory and taste fibres from the anterior two thirds of the tongue (i.e. anterior to the circumvallate papillae). These fibres are carried in the chorda tympani nerve. The circumvallate papillae and the mucus membrane posterior to them are supplied by the glossopharyngeal nerve. The vagus nerve carries general visceral sensory fibres from the palate, pharynx, larynx, heart, lungs and alimentary tract. It has a small somatic sensory supply to the posterior part of the external acoustic meatus and the tympanic membrane by its auricular branch. "

Aortic root diseases causing dilatation include dissection, syphilis, Marfan's, long-standing hypertension, coarctation, seronegative spondyloarthritides (Reiter's, psoriatic, ankylosing spondylitis), relapsing polychondritis and giant cell arteritis. With chronic aortic regurgitation, the left ventricle will dilate if the patient is not followed up carefully. The diastolic murmur of AR gets shorter with increasing severity as it takes less time for the aortic and left ventricular diastolic pressures to equalise.

Acquired angioedema may occur in the paraneoplastic syndrome due to an autoantibody against C1-esterase inhibitor. Clinical features include attacks of laryngeal and subcutaneous oedema, abdominal pain, vomiting and diarrhoea Precipitants include stress, menstruation, infection, oestrogen therapy and ACE inhibitors. Chronic granulomatous diseases (such as tuberculosis and sarcoidosis) are associated with an increase in both cellular and humoral immunity. There is polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia and, in tuberculosis, circulating immune complexes are increased. CH50 is a marker of total haemolytic complement activity. SLE is associated with low serum complement C3 levels and thus CH50 will be reduced. Other conditions associated with low C3 levels include infective endocarditis and glomerulonephritis (mesangiocapillary and poststreptococcal). Cryoglobulinaemia is typically associated with normal C3 but reduced C4 and CH50. Burkitt's lymphoma is a B-cell-derived tumour associated with EBV infection and the most common chromosomal abnormality is a t(8,14) translocation. "

In inflammatory conditions the total WBC increases and the majority of the cells are now polymorphs. However, the actual count may vary from patient-topatient and is not in itself diagnostic (septic arthritis - 5-500 x 109/1, >80% PMN; gout 2-200 x 109/1, 60% PMN; rheumatoid arthritis 2-100 x 109/1, >50% PMN, etc.). The synovial fluid glucose is usually low in Reiter's, septic arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. Synovial complement levels are elevated in Reiter's, but low in rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, gout and sepsis. Patients with haemochromatosis typically have iron deposition within the synovial cells of the joint space; haemosiderin-laden macrophages are characteristic of haemarthroses. "

Afferent nerve fibres form the carotid sinus nerve and then pass via the glossopharangeal nerve (IXth cranial nerve) to the cell bodies located in the petrous ganglion. Central axons pass from this ganglion to the nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem. The receptors are sensitive to pressure and stretch (not pH). Stretch of the carotid sinus (by increased arterial pressure) produces a burst of impulses which then slow down and results in reflex bradycardia and hypotension (discovered by Hering in 1923). Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is a rare condition characterised by intense vagal discharge, AV block, hypotension and syncope. Dual chamber pacing carries the best chance of maintaining the BP. It is not a common cause of syncope in young women! "

Multiple endocrine neoplasia type III (= MEN IIb) has the same features as MEN type IIa but in addition is associated with a Marfanoid habitus, mucosal and intestinal neuromata; protruberent lips produce a characteristic facies. Hyperparathyroidism is relatively rare. The gene for this (IIa and IIb) has been termed the ret locus and is located on chromosome 10.

CD4 is a surface glycoprotein (gp) which binds to gp120 on the surface of the HIV particle. CD4 is also present on macrophages, Langerhan cells and dendritic cells of blood/lymph nodes. These cells act as reservoirs for virus and their immune responses (antigen presentation and T-cell activation) are also impaired. Other cells such as microglial cells and colonic epithelial cells can also be infected but less efficiently. Anti-HIV antibodies usually appear 6-12 weeks after initial infection. HIV can be cultured from peripheral blood lymphocytes of asymptomatic individuals infected with the virus even before the anti-HIV titres rise. However, the levels of infective virus are generally low and the p24 antigen is not detectable by ELISA.

Although the `malignant' cell may be of myeloid lineage, similar gene defects are evident in the erythroid and megakaryocyte lineages. Rearrangements of the immunoglobulin genes to bring the genes of the variable, joining and constant regions within close proximity are an early event in B cell maturation. Analysis of B cell malignancies often shows some or all of the rearrangements have taken place, allowing identification of the `maturation status' of the malignant clone. GMCSF is responsible for the proliferation and differentiation of monocyte and granulocyte precursors. However, the leukaemic cells in CML display a `maturation block' and do not respond to this therapy. The malignant clone in pro-myelocytic leukaemia still retains responsiveness to retinoic acid derivatives and these have been used successfully to induce differentiation in patients with this form of leukaemia.

Features: abdominal bloating, diarrhoea (may be epidemic), nutritional deficiencies (B12, folate, vitamin D) (need malabsorption of 2 or more nutrients (e.g. B12, and fats) for diagnosis). Whipple's disease (malabsorption, systemic symptoms, arthritis, lymphadenopathy, intracranial masses, pulmonary infiltrates, etc.) is caused by Trophelma whippoli. It responds to chloramphenicol or 2 weeks penicillin + streptomycin then tetracycline for 1 year. Intestinal lymphangiectasia may be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to lymph obstruction (malignancy, constrictive pericarditis). It produces steatorrhoea and hypoproteinaemia. Treatment: replace dietary fat by medium-chain TGs. Alpha-chain disease is a plasma cell proliferation in the small bowel producing an IgA (seen in the Mediterranean and S. America - poor hygeine and intestinal infestation). Antibiotics work initially but the patients usually require chemotherapy for the underlying myeloma. Antibiotics are useful in treating bacterial overgrowth and malabsorption in systemic sclerosis. "

Associations include diabetes mellitus, severe hypertension, 3rd trimester of pregnancy, dental anaesthesia and cold exposure. Hyperacusis is due to involvement of the branch to stapedius. Loss of taste and numbness of the tongue may also occur. (Facial numbness suggests Vth nerve involvement; scalp tingling -C2 nerve; loss of gag reflex - IXth nerve; palatal weakness - Xth nerve.)

If the predominant deflection of the QRS is positive this is highly suggestive of VT. Negative concordance is less so; - QRS >140 ms (3.5 small sq) especially with normal duration in sinus rhythm; - Marked left axis deviation (negative in II); - In patients with previous LBBB or RBBB, a different QRS morphology in tachycardia suggests VT.

It is essential to know part of the sequence of the gene (but not the full sequence) to allow synthesis of short oligonucleotides (primers), one complementary to each of the two strands of the DNA. The basic procedure involves heating the sample to 95°C to denature the DNA. The sample is then cooled to allow the primers to anneal to the DNA. These serve as start sites for the polymerase that synthesises a strand complementary to the DNA. The procedure is then repeated for several (30-40) cycles. PCR has been used for prenatal diagnosis and can be performed on single cells (fetal cells have been found in the peripheral blood of pregnant women). "

Neonates are hyperthyroid as the maternal antibody persists for up to 2 months and may need treatment with propylthiouracil. Carbimazole is worse than propylthoiuracil at causing neonatal goitre. Radioiodine cannot be used as it causes cretinism and goitre. Side-effects of the anti-thyroid drugs (propylthiouracil and carbimazole): agranulocytosis (approx. 0.1% of patients), rash, fever, arthralgia, and jaundice. "

This seems unique for CML but may occasionally be seen with other myeloproliferative diseases. Ph' negative CML may have the same molecular defect, but patients usually have a worse prognosis with more resistant disease and earlier evolution to accelerated phase. A low leukocyte alkaline phosphatase is a unique finding in CML and usually rises once the patient enters the chronic stable phase. Raised serum uric acid reflects increased cell turnover. Elevated vitamin B12 binding protein (mainly TC-I which is synthesised by the white cells) is also found and correlates with the degree of leukocytosis. Acceleration to acute leukaemia or myelofibrosis is associated with accumualation of other chromosomal abnormalities. Busulphan or hydroxyurea control the white cell count but do not delay the onset of accelerated phase bone marrow transplantation may be curative. "

Drugs available fall into three classes: Nucleoside analogues (e.g. zidovudine-AZT, didanosineddI,zalcitabine-ddC, stavudine-d4T and lamivudine-3TC) require activation within the cell and then inhibit reverse transcriptase and terminate viral replication; protease inhibitors (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir) prevent viral maturation; and non-nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (e.g. delavirdine, loviride and nevirapine) are still in trial. Of the nucleoside analogues, lamivudine appears to be the best tolerated although pancreatitis and peripheral neuropathy have been reported. The protease inhibitors inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes and increase the plasma concentration of benzodiazepines, terfenadine, cisapride, astemizole and rifabutin. Ritonavir solution contains 43% ethanol and should not be given with metronidazole (disulfira-reaction). Primary HIV infection is associated with a burst of viral replication and zidovudine therapy for 6 months delays disease progression and the development of minor opportunistic infections. Given to pregnant mothers antepartum and during delivery, and to the newborn for 6 weeks, zidovudine has been shown to reduce the risk of perinatal HIV transmission from 26% to 8% and should be offered to all HIV-positive pregnant women.

The most rapid (milliseconds) is by the receptor directly opening (or closing) an ion channel (e.g. nicotinic acetylcholine receptor). The second is by coupling of the receptor to G-proteins and influencing protein phosphorylation or ion channels via secondary messengers, e.g. the beta adrenergic receptor and the muscarinic receptor (acetylcholine). In the third mechanism the receptor directly phosphorylates the target protein (often another cellular phosphorylase or phosphatase) - the insulin receptor displays tyrosine kinase activity.

They have been shown to reduce mortality in patients following an acute MI (4-S study). An idiosyncratic side-effect is rhabdomyolysis. Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia cannot make LDL receptors and so these drugs are relatively ineffective in these patients. Cholestyramine sequesters bile acid in the intestine and prevents its reabsorption. The result is decreased absorption of cholesterol and diversion of endogenous cholesterol into bile acid synthesis in the liver. This leads to increased LDL receptors on hepatic cells and increased removal of LDL from the blood. Fibrates stimulate lipoprotein lipase. "

This is the basis of fast and slow acetylation (e.g. hydralazine) and slow and poor metabolism (e.g. debrisoquine). The prevalence of these polymorphisms shows considerable variation between racial groups. Genetic polymorphisms are determined by abnormalities of gene expression and are not dependent on the pharmacological actions of the drug. However, the consequences of poor metabolism of a particular drug are clearly dependent on its pharmacological actions: drugs with a steep dose-response curve or a low therapeutic index may well produce toxic effects in poor metabolisers.

Patients exhibit a Fanconi-like syndrome with renal failure by their early teens. Adults may display dysphagia from oesophageal dysfunction. Oral cystamine arrests the disease progression by depleting intracellular stores of cysteine. Hartnup's disease is due to defective tubular reabsorption of neutral amino acids. This results in tryptophan malabsorption and nicotinamide deficiency (pellagra). Alport's syndrome (AD) females are mildly affected compared to males. It is associated with mild deafness, lens abnormalities, platelet dysfunction, hyperprolinaemia and mental retardation. Fabry's disease (AR, galactosidase A deficiency) in females is often associated with renal impairment alone. In affected males, other features include corneal dystrophy, angiokeratomas (in a `swimming trunk' distribution), ischaemic heart disease and acroparasthesiae. "

Patients with mitral stenosis may deteriorate significantly during gestation due to the fixed flow obstruction. The increased heart rate and cardiac output with the decrease in colloid osmotic pressure predispose to pulmonary oedema. Aggressive diuretic therapy is contraindicated as it may decrease uterine perfusion pressure. VSD and ASD are usually well tolerated in pregnancy, even among patients with large left-right shunts. However, the degree of pulmonary hypertension should guide management as marked reduction in blood pressure during or after delivery may result in reversal of the shunt. Aortic regurgitation is also well tolerated (as is mitral regurgitation) probably as the systemic vascular resistance falls.

Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysms carry a very high mortality. If untreated 50% die within 48 hours, up to 70% within 1 week and 90% within 3 months. Patients are commonly men aged 40-70 (Afrocarribean > Caucasian). Clinical features may point to the site of dissection. Aortic incompetence, inferior infarction on the ECG (right coronary ostial involvement), cardiac tamponade and Marfanoid habitus suggest ascending aortic involvement. Asymmetric upper limb pulses and stroke suggest arch involvement. Descending aortic involvement results in haemothorax or pleural effusions, absent or reduced femoral pulses and renal failure. "

        "ope": " Looser's zones",
        "answer": "ACE",
        "explanation": "In osteomalacia there is impaired mineralisation of bone usually consequent on vitamin D deficiency. In ricketts this occurs during bone growth (i.e. in childhood). This may be from dietary deficiency, lack of sunlight or renal wasting (e.g. renal tubular acidosis in Fanconi's syndrome). The kidney converts 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-HCC) to the active compound 1,25-dihydroxyclolecalciferol (1,25-DHCC) and patients with renal failure develop osteomalacia if this is not replaced either as alphacalcidol (1-alpha-hydroxycholecalciferol) or calcitriol (1,25DHCC). The liver metabolises (activates and deactivates) vitamin D; chronic liver disease (failure of activation) or anticonvulsant therapy (induction of enzymes to deactivate vitamin D) can produce osteomalacia. Hypophosphataemic ricketts (vitamin D-resistant ricketts) is an Xlinked dominant disorder where there is renal unresponsiveness to vitamin D. Radiological changes in osteomalacia include Looser's zones (apparent partial fractures seen in scapulae and long bones without displacement) and loss of cortical bone giving rise to the characteristic appearance of the vertebrae (`codfish vertebrae', `rugger-jersey spine'). Bone cysts are a feature of hyperparathyroidism. Subperiosteal bone resorption is seen in osteoporosis and hyperparathyroidism. "

The natural isomer is L-lactate and the body is unable to metabolise the D-isomer.

In diabetes insipidus the urine remains abnormally dilute (urine osmolality < 400 mOsm/kg).

Thus all newborns from HIV-positive mothers will be positive for the antibody - though not necessarily infected with the virus. No developmental abnormalities have been associated with transplacental passage of virus. However, in developing countries, there is a detrimental effect on pregnancy through maternal ill health. There is some evidence that vaginal delivery carries a higher risk of transmission of HIV than caesarian section and in one study, first-born twins were at higher risk than their sibling. There is no increased risk of HIV transmission in subsequent pregnancies. HIV can be cultured from breast milk and can be transmitted to newborns via this route.

        "explanation": "Pulmonary involvement in rheumatoid arthritis may precede the onset of arthritis. Commonly it produces pleural adhesions and effusions (typically the effusion has low glucose). Obliterative bronchiolitis is a rare but recognised complication and may respond to steroid therapy. Stridor is due to involvement of the cricoaryetenoid joints and may be accompanied by dyspnoea and occasionally obstruction necessitating tracheostomy. Rheumatoid nodules, single or multiple, may occur in the lungs and frequently cavitate. Caplan's syndrome occurs in patients exposed to coal or other inorganic dusts. There is massive pulmonary fibrosis and nodule formation. Pulmonary fibrosis is less common but occurs with chronic disease. "

        "answer": "BDE",
        "explanation": "Cushing's syndrome results in loss of the diurnal rhythm of cortisol secretion and produces a persistently elevated serum (and 24 hour urine) cortisol. Adrenal tumours usually do not suppress with dexamethasone. Serum ACTH is undetectable. In Cushing's disease (i.e. adrenal hyperplasia due to excess pituitary ACTH secretion), there may be some suppression of the serum cortisol with high-dose dexamethasone but usually not to normal values. Serum ACTH is elevated but less than in ectopic ACTH production. Hypokalaemia suggests ectopic ACTH secretion (and is often associated with mild alkalosis). Only 10-30% of patients with ectopic ACTH secretion suppress with high-dose dexamethasone. Metyrapone inhibits 11-beta-hydroxylase (a step in the synthesis of cortisol) and results in a loss in the negative feedback of cortisol on the pituitary. This produces a rise in ACTH secretion and a rise in urinary 17-oxogenic steroids (17-OGS). In pituitary Cushing's, metyrapone produces a large rise in urinary 17-OGS: in ectopic ACTH secretion or adrenal tumours, although serum cortisol levels fall, there is usually no increase in urinary 17-OGS. Patients with depression and alcoholism may exhibit `pseudo-Cushing's' - this is thought to be due to an increase in release of CRF by the hypothalamus. They will increase 24-hour urine cortisol, loss of diurnal secretion of cortisol; low-dose dexamethasone may fail to suppress the serum cortisol but this will almost invariably suppress with high-dose dexamethasone.

Subvalvular stenosis may be due to a discrete fibromuscular ring, septal hypertrophy (as in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), anomalous attachment of the mitral valve leaflet, etc., and is often associated with aortic regurgitation. Supravalvular stenosis is associated with Williams' syndrome (autosomal dominant with variable penetrance). Associations are `elfin' facies, hypercalcaemia and hypervitaminosis D, peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis, pulmonary valve stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mesenteric artery stenosis and thoracic aortic aneurysms. Unequal upper limb pulses are seen in coarctation of the aorta which is associated with bicuspid aortic valve. However, aortic stenosis does not CAUSE unequal limb pulses. Angina may occur with normal coronary arteries due to an imbalance in myocardial oxygen supply (shorter diastole with longer systole, impaired coronary perfusion, etc.) vs demand (cardiac hypertrophy, increased cardiac work).

        "explanation": "In first-order kinetics, the rate of elimination of a drug is dependent on the concentration of the drug and this applies to the majority of drugs in clinical use (the concentration of the drug in plasma falls in an exponential manner). Zero-order (or saturation kinetics) refers to the situation where the rate of elimination is independent of concentration and the drug levels fall at a constant rate. Examples of this are ethanol and salicylate. Phenytoin elimination is first-order at low concentrations and then zero order. One consequence of zero-order metabolism is that the duration of action of the drug is more dependent on the dose and another is that once the maximum rate of elimination is reached, in theory the concentration of the drug in the body can increase indefinitely with no steady-state level being achieved.

In patients where this is due to an autoimmune process, other autoimmune disorders such as vitiligo, diabetes mellitus and myasthenia gravis are more common. Common abnormalities on investigation include eosinophilia (mechanism unknown), low sodium, raised or normal potassium, raised urea, mild metabolic acidosis, hypocalcaemia or hypercalcaemia (seen in about 6%, mechanism uncertain). The ECG shows low voltage QRS complexes and T waves (the hyperkalaemia is usually too mild to produce any of the typical changes), prolongation of the PR interval and the corrected QT interval. The patients have an increase in ADH secretion (in response to the hypovolaemia produced by hypoadrenalism) and so exhibit a delay in the excretion of a free water load (this may be used as a diagnositic test). Patients with secondary adrenal failure usually exhibit pallor (due to pituitary failure). In these patients, aldosterone is preserved so the electrolytes are less affected. However, the patients may still get hypovolaemia from diarrhoea and vomiting or diabetes insipidus (resulting in raised urea), and hyponatraemia due to SIADH or hypothyroidism. "

Capillary filtration in dependent tissues increases producing a 5-10% fall in plasma volume over the next hour.

They are less prone to non-specific effects such as promoting platelet aggregation but are as effective as standard heparin in anticoagulating the patient. Hirudin is the most potent naturally occurring (in leeches) inhibitor of thrombin. Recombinant hirudin is now available and is being investigated in the treatment of unstable angina and myocardial infarction. GP IIb/IIIa receptors on platelets are critical for platelet aggregation. Fab fragments of monoclonal antibodies against this protein inhibit aggregation and are being investigated in the treatment of unstable angina, prevention of restenosis following angioplasty and a number of other clinical situations. Alteplase is a recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator based on the human sequence; unlike streptokinase it is not antigenic. It may be used in patients with antibodies to streptokinae.

DDAVP stimulates the immediate release of Factor VIII:C and von Willebrand factor (vWF) from endothelial cell stores and avoids the risks of factor transfusions. However, repeat doses are only fully effective when given about 48 hours later. It has no effect on Factor IX:C levels (Christmas disease).

        "explanation": "The endothelins are a family of vasoactive peptides. Three members have been identified: endothelin-I is the most potent vasoconstrictor identified to date. It stimulates growth in a number of cell types including vascular smooth muscle cells. The endothelins are generated from precursor molecules by endothelin-converting enzyme (like angiotensin II by ACE). The enzymes degrading endothelins have not yet been characterised but include endopeptidase-24.11. Nitric oxide, or NO (also known as EDRF-endothelium derived relaxant factor) is cleaved from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthetase. NO is produced continuously by the vascular endothelium and maintains the vasculature in a state of active vasodilatation; thus antagonists (e.g. L-NMMA or L-NAME) produce vasoconstriction in normal human volunteers. NO stimulates soluble guanylate cyclase to produce cyclic GMP which mediates its actions. Inhibition of cGMP breakdown will potentiate NO activity. "

The myocardium has a very high oxygen extraction ratio and venous blood from the heart always has a low oxygen content. Exercise and tachycardia increase the myocardial oxygen demand and result in coronary vasodilatation, increasing oxygen delivery. Stenoses prevent this and diminish the coronary flow reserve. Hyperbaric oxygen conversely causes coronary vasoconstriction. Adenosine causes coronary (and peripheral arteriolar) vasodilatation.

The sensitivity of the test is the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test (i.e. the proportion of patients with migraine who test positive).

The positive predictive value is the proportion of those who test positive who actually are positive (i.e. the proportion of patients with migraine out of all those who test positive).

On the basis of radiology it is divided into 4 stages (0 = normal CXR, 1 = bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL), 2 = BHL and infiltration of lung parenchyma, 3 = pulmonary infiltration without BHL). Any organ system may be affected; heart failure is usually due to cardiac infiltration. Lofgren's syndrome is the association of BHL, erythema nodosum, anterior uveitis and joint pains and up to 80% will show spontaneous remission. Heerfordt syndrome is bilateral parotid enlargement, facial palsy and uveitis. Lacrimal involvement gives sicca syndrome. Diagnosis: serum ACE is raised in 65% of patients with active disease and correlates with disease activity, but it is non-specific and is raised in a number of other conditions also (TB, asbestosis, silicosis, lymphoma). The CD4:CD8 ratio is increased. Tuberculin test is negative in most patients and the Kveim test is positive in 85% of acute disease and 35% of chronic disease (and up to 40% of patients with Crohn's disease). Transbronchial biopsy is positive in the majority of patients with BHL. Hypercalcaemia is due to increased production of 1,25-vit D3 by the sarcoid macrophages.

However, repeat doses are only fully effective when given about 48 hours later. It has no effect on factor IX:C levels. Osler-Weber-Rendu (heriditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia) is associated with abnormally fragile blood vessels (telagiectasia), which are prone to bleed.

Hypophosphatasia is a condition where there is a deficiency of alkaline phosphatase and patients cannot break down pyrophosphate. This results in dwarfism with disproportionately short limbs (also seen with achondroplasia and Ellis van Creveld syndrome).

        "ope": " Multiple sclerosis",
        "answer": "AE",
        "explanation": "Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is thought to be caused by reactivation of measles virus often 6 or more years after primary infection, producing slow deterioration and usually leading to death. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a spongiform encephalopathy thought to be caused by a prion (an `infective' particle that appears to consist entirely of protein and no DNA or RNA). It is related to bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie in sheep. The infective agent is ingested and, after an incubation period of years, clinical features (seizures, dementia, gait disturbance) develop. Recently, a new variant of spongiform encephalopathy has been identified that may have developed by cross-species transmission of BSE; the evidence for this is scant. CSF gammaglobulins are not elevated. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is an infection caused by the Creutzfeldt-Jakob virus and produces progressive demyelination - CSF total protein may be increased but gammaglobulins are normal.

        "answer": "BD",
        "explanation": "The musculocutaneous nerve is the terminal branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. It supplies biceps, brachialis and coracobrachialis in the arm and ends as the lateral cutaneous nerve of the forearm supplying both surfaces of the radial side of the forearm. The deltoid is supplied by the axillary nerve. The radial nerve arises from the posterior cord and runs posterior to the shaft of the humerus and then curves to pass into the forearm anterior to the elbow joint. It supplies triceps, brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and gives cutaneous branches to the lateral and posterior aspects of the arm and forearm. The median nerve has no branches in the arm. It supplies all the forearm flexors except flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial aspect of flexor digitorum profundus (ulnar nerve). It supplies the short muscles of the thumb except adductor policis (ulnar), and the lateral two lumbricals. The ulnar nerve has no branches in the arm and passes into the forearm posterior to the medial epicondyle. "

        "explanation": "The commonest manifestation of seroconversion following HIV infection is a mononucleosislike syndrome. Other recognised syndromes include aseptic meningoencephalitis, encephalopathy, myelopathy and peripheral neuropathy. In many individuals, seroconversion is subclinical. Following the acute infection (stage I), individuals are usually asymptomatic for 3-4 years (stage II) before developing persistent generalised lymphadenopathy (non-tender; stage III). Patients developing other disease are classified as stage IV. Predictors of progression to AIDS include: clinical features (fever, weight loss, oral hairy leukoplakia) and laboratory investigations (anaemia, reduced haematocrit, fall in CD4 count, raised ESR, rise in p24 antigen). The drug of choice for pneumocystis is cotrimoxazole. Pentamidine may be used in patients intolerant to cotrimoxazole. "

        "answer": "ABD",
        "explanation": "Enoximone is a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor and exerts most of its effects on the myocardium. It reduces afterload and increases cardiac contractility and cardiac output. Adrenaline acts on both alpha and beta receptors. At low doses, beta effects predominate (tachycardia, increased cardiac output, lower SVR) but at higher doses, alpha effects take over with peripheral vasoconstriction. Noradrenaline is mainly an alpha-agonist and increases the SVR. Isoprenaline is a beta-agonist and produces a tachycardia, increasing myocardial consumption. Dobutamine increases cardiac output and vasodilates by acting on beta-adrenergic receptors. "

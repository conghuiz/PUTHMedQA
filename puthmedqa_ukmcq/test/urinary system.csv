urinary system,1,A female patient aged 30 has a five-year history of difficulty getting upstairs and out of a low chair and mild upper limb weakness but no pain. There is no family history. She presented with severe type 2 respiratory failure and an ECHO shows cardiomyopathy of unknown aetiology. EMG showed evidence of myopathy. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Acid maltase deficiency,Inclusion body myositis,Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome,Miller-Fisher syndrome,Polymyositis,A,"Acid maltase deficiency typically presents with insidious onset of proximal myopathy and early respiratory muscle weakness. It is caused by a defect in the acid Alpha glucosidase gene and leads to accumultion of glycogen in the muscles and tissues of the body.  Respiratory failure in inflammatory myopathies (polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis) and limb girdle muscular dystrophy are rare. Muscle biopsy shows vacuolation in muscle fibres. Miller-Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, is characterised by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome, often a paraneoplastic phenomenon, is associated with hyporeflexia which returns after exercise, autonomic symptoms and fatiguability."
urinary system,2,Which one of the following is a sign of advance stage HIV?,Anal canal warts,Extra genital molluscum contagiosum,Multidermatomal shingles,Oesophageal candidiasis,Oral candidiasis,D,The term andquot;AIDS defining illnessandquot; is less commonly used in place of andquot;advanced HIV diseaseandquot; Any opportunistic infections or opportunistic malignancies are signs of advanced HIV disease. Oesophageal candidiasis is also a sign of advanced HIV disease but oral candidiasis is not. Anal warts are not an opportunistic infection. Extragenital molluscum contagiosum is also not an opportunistic infection but frequently occurs in symptomatic HIV-positive patients. Multidermatomal shingles is not an opportunistic infection but if it occurs in a young person HIV infection needs to be excluded. 
urinary system,3,What is the most likely outcome of minimal change nephropathy with onset at 12 years of age?,Frequent relapse,Full renal recovery,Permanent renal impairment,Persistent hypertension,Persistent proteinuria,B,"Thirty to forty percent of children achieve spontaneous remission and 90% achieve remission following eight weeks treatment with high dose steroids. The disease is less common in adults, but over 80% of adults also achieve remission following treatment with oral glucocorticoids."
urinary system,4,"A 70 year old male with previous radiation therapy for colorectal carcinoma presents with non specific symptoms of weight loss, malaise, nausea and dull abdominal and back pain. He has also noticed increased frequency and hesitancy of urination. Bloods reveal a normochromic anaemia, increased ESR and renal failure.. His renal failure does not improve with fluids and an ultrasound is organised. This reveals a retroperitoneal mass. Given the likely diagnosis, which of the following drugs may be the underlying cause?",Azathioprine,Methotrexate,Ramipril,Prednisolone,Methysergide,E,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis is rare. It is characterised by fibro inflammatory tissue around the aorta and iliac arteries, into the retroperitoneum and surrounding other structures such as the ureters. It is thought to be an autoimmune process to insoluble lipid leaking from atherosclerotic plaques plaques. This can lead to an obstructive uropathy as seen here. In the majority there is no clear underlying cause found however t has been associated with aortic aneurysm, renal tract trauma, infection, retroperitoneal malignancy, post irradiation and chemotherapy and with certain drugs such as methysergide, beta blockers, methyldopa and amphetamines. It has also been associated with certain autoimmune disease and vasculitis such as PBC, Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and polyarteritis nodosa. Lymphomas, sarcoma , pancreatic carcinomas and other malignancies can also lead to similar appearances to it on ultrasound and these are therefore differentials. However in this case the previous radiation therapy is a clue. and MRI can be utilised to assess further the degree of fibrosis. A biopsy may be required if the other differentials cannot be excluded. Intravenous urography is useful in assessing the degree of ureteric obstruction. Removal of the offending agent, steroids, immunosuppressants and ureterolysis and ureteric stent placement for obstruction have all been utilised in the management."
urinary system,5,Spironolactone is an aldosterone antagonist. Where in the kidneys does aldosterone have its effect?,Distal convoluted tubule,Thin ascending loop of henle,Proximal convoluted tubule,Descending loop of henle,Thick ascending loop of henle,A,Aldosterone acts on mineralocorticoid receptors in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts to increase basolateral sodium/potassium pumps thus leading to increased sodium and water reabsorption.
urinary system,6,A 19-year-old girl presents at the antenatal clinic. She is approximately six weeks pregnant and the pregnancy was unplanned. She has a two year history of grand mal epilepsy for which she takes carbamazepine. She has had no fits for approximately six months. She wants to continue with her pregnancy if it is safe to do so. She is worried about the anticonvulsant therapy and its effects on the baby. She asks how she should be managed. Which of the following management plans is the most appropriate in this case?,Advise termination due to drug teratogenicity,Continue with carbamazepine,Stop carbamazepine until the second trimester,Switch therapy to phenytoin,Switch therapy to sodium valproate,B,"The patient and fetus are at far more risk from uncontrolled seizures than from any potential teratogenic effect of the therapy. In pregnancy total plasma concentrations of anticonvulsants fall, so the dose may need to be increased. The potential teratogenic effects (particularly neural tube defects) of carbamazepine do need to be explained and in an effort to reduce this risk she should receive folate supplements. Screening with alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and second trimester ultrasound are required. Vitamin K should be given to the mother prior to delivery. There is no point in switching therapies as this could precipitate seizures in an otherwise stable patient. Similarly both phenytoin and valproate are associated with teratogenic effects. "
urinary system,7,A 14-year-old old boy presents with a sore throat and macroscopic haematuria. What would light microscopy of a kidney biopsy most likely show?,Collapsed glomeruli ,Crescentic glomerulonephritis ,Mesangial hypercellularity ,Normal tissue ,Segmental sclerosis ,C,The most common cause of macroscopic haematuria in a child is IgA nephritis. This usually develops one to two days after a sore throat. It is most common in the second and third decades of life and is three times more common in males. The urine may be frankly bloody or may be the colour of cola. There are no clots in the urine and the haematuria is generally painless although some patients complain of mild loin pain. It tends to settle spontaneously within five days although the episodes may be recurrent lasting for one to two years. Renal biopsy will show mesangial IgA deposition on immunofluorescence and light microscopy will show mesangial hypercellularity and matrix expansion.
urinary system,8,Inappropriately high parathyroid hormone secretion (PTH) in renal patients can lead to significant bone reabsorption and premature fractures. Which one of the following is known to stimulate parathyroid hormone production?,Calcium acetate tablets,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperphosphataemia,Hypophosphataemia,Serum alkaline phosphatase,C,Hyperphosphataemia is known directly to stimulate the parathyroid gland to produce PTH. Hypercalcaemia and hypophosphataemia should suppress PTH production via negative feedback pathways. Hence these options are incorrect. Phosphate binders such as calcium acetate are used to reduce phosphate in the serum and hence lower PTH production. Serum alkaline phosphatase has no bearing on PTH production but may rise in hyperparathyroid states due to increased bone turnover.
urinary system,9,A 24 year old is found to have chronic renal failure. There is a history of numerous UTIs as a child. On ultrasound there is evidence of renal scarring. She is hypertensive. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Posterior urethral valve,Polycystic kidney disease,Reflux Nephropathy,Pyelonephritis,Hypertensive renal disease,C,The history of numerous UTI and evidence of renal scarring is highly indicative of vesicoureteric reflux leading to reflux nephropathy.
urinary system,10,"A 65-year-old woman has urinary frequency, weight loss, hematuria and blood clots. An abdominal ultrasound is inconclusive. What is the single most appropriate investigation?",IVU,Nuclear scan,Renal Ultrasound,Serum cholesterol concentration,Cystoscopy,E,"Features are of bladder cancer supported by age, weight loss and hematuria. In bladder cancer there develop UTI like symptom as frequency, dysuria etc"
urinary system,11,"A 79-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department following a mechanical fall, resulting in a left fractured neck of femur and a long-lie of 14 hours. She is oliguric; her urine is dark in colour and shows 4+ to haemoglobin on urine dipstick. Which of the following is consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis?",Hypocalcaemia,Hypokalaemia,Hyponatraemia,Hypophosphataemia,Thrombocytopenia,A,"Her urine is dark due to myoglobin. Dipstick will be positive for blood (a false positive). On microscopy, no red cells are seen although there may be pigmented granular casts. As serum calcium is bound to damaged muscle, rhabdomyolysis may result in hypocalcaemia. Around 20% of patients become hypercalcaemic during recovery as this bound calcium is remobilised. Hypokalaemia is not a typical feature of rhabdomyolysis Instead, hyperkalaemia may be present and is a life-threatening complication of the syndrome. It occurs because potassium is released from necrotic myocytes and this is exacerbated in the context of acute kidney injury and metabolic acidosis. However, severe hypokalaemia is considered as one of the causes of rhabdomyolysis. Hyponatraemia is not a typical feature of rhabdomyolysis. Instead, sodium may be high if the patient is water deplete following trauma. Hypophosphataemia is not a typical feature of rhabdomyolysis. Phosphate may instead be normal or high. However, severe hypophosphataemia is considered as one of the causes of rhabdomyolysis. Thrombocytopenia would warrant consideration of an alternate diagnosis. It is not a typical feature of rhabdomyolysis."
urinary system,12,"A 28 year old female presents to her GP with joint pain , fever, a butterfly rash and fatigue. She has marked peripheral oedema. She is found to be hypertensive, in acute renal failure, low albumin levels and proteinuria. A renal biopsy is performed and reveals focal glomerulonephritis with subendothelial and mesangial immune deposits. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lupus nephritis class II,Membranous glomeurlonephritis,IgA nephropathy,Lupus nephritis Class III,Lupus nephritis class I,D,"This patient presents with features of SLE.   Lupus nephritis can lead to hypertension, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and renal failure.  There is immune complex deposition and complement activation and can lead to various findings on renal biopsy. In class I there is minimal change with some mesangial immune deposits and mild proteinuria. In Class II there is mesangial hypercellularity and mesangial immune deposits and presents with mild renal disease. In class III there is focal lupus nephritis with renal biopsy findings as described. There is normally active SLE and moderate proteinuria."
urinary system,13,Which of the following drugs is useful in the treatment of steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome?,Methotrexate,Ramipril,Infliximab,Furosemide,Cyclophosphamide,E,"In those who have steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome then cyclophosphamide may be trialled. Other options include ciclosporin, tacrolimus and levamisole. Ramipril is sometimes useful in the management of adults. Furosemide is useful for the treatment of the oedema associated."
urinary system,14,"A 35-year-old man with a known history of epilepsy presents with a skin rash, lymphadenopathy and gingival hypertrophy. Which of the following medications is most likely to be responsible for his symptoms?",Carbamazapine,Lamotrigene,Lorazepam,Phenytoin,Sodium valproate,D,"Common side effects of phenytoin include gingival hyperplasia, coarsening of the facies, and hirsutism. Phenytoin is linked to a hypersensitivity syndrome manifested by fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. Patients receiving phenytoin may develop pseudolymphoma or, rarely, malignant lymphoma and mycosis-fungoides-like lesions."
urinary system,15,"A 56 year old male with known peripheral vascular disease and ischaemic heart disease is currently on amlodipine and bendroflumethiazide for blood pressure control.  On his last few blood pressure checks he has been found to be hypertensive.  He is therefore commenced on ramipril.  He had his bloods checked one week later and was found to be in acute renal failure. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the most appropriate management?","Stop ACE inhibitor, Start Aspirin, Statin and optimal blood pressure control",Ultrasound,Stop ACE inhbitor until bloods normalise then restart at lower dose,Renal angioplasty,Renal artery thrombolysis,A,Medical management of renal artery stenosis has been shown to be as equally as effective as angioplasty and stenting.
urinary system,16,A mother comes to your office concerned about her 2-year-old son. She has noticed that he typically laughs inappropriately for no particular reason. Shortly after an event he appears to be fidgeting. These events last only minutes and in between the events he acts normally. What is your suspected diagnosis?,Gelastic seizures,Malingering,Pseudobulbar affect,Substance abuse,Tourette's,A,Gelastic seizures should be suspected in cases of erratic laughing or crying. It can be hard to identify in young children but there is usually associated automatisms such as fidgeting or lip smacking or change in sensorium. Pseudobulbar affect can also present with inappropriate affective responses but typically occurs in adult patients with brainstem or frontal disease. It can be seen in multiple sclerosis or motor neuron disease. The vignette is not typical for a tic disorder and it is unlikely a 2-year-old is malingering or abusing substances.
urinary system,17,A 20-year-old female presents with acute onset of left foot drop. Examination reveals weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and eversion. There is sensory loss over the dorsum of the foot. Reflexes were all present and plantars flexor. Which of the following nerves is likely to be involved?,Common peroneal nerve,Femoral nerve,Inferior gluteal nerve,Sciatic nerve,Tibial nerve,A,Peroneal neuropathy usually presents with acute foot drop. The foot and ankle weakness on neurological examination is restricted to ankle and toe dorsiflexion and ankle eversion. Ankle reflex (tibial nerve mediated) and knee reflex (femoral nerve mediated) are intact. Sensory involvement may include the lower two thirds of the lateral leg and dorsum of foot. Sciatic nerve issues may result in impaired knee flexion and tibial nerve lesions may lead to weakness in foot flexion and plantar surface pain.
urinary system,18,Which drug is a recommended treatment option for urinary frequency?,Duloxetine,Flavoxate,Propiverine,Imipramine,Propantheline,C,Propiverine is an antimuscarinic agent used to treat urinary incontinence or increased urinary frequency or urgency.
urinary system,19,"A 78-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with a right sided facial palsy affecting the whole of the right side of his face. Of the following, which is the most likely cause?",Left sided infarct affecting the frontal lobe,Left sided infarct affecting the internal capsule,Right sided fifth nerve palsy,Right sided infarct affecting the internal capsule,Right sided seventh nerve palsy,E,Upper motor neuron lesions tend to spare the forehead as it is bilaterally innervated. Forehead involvement suggests a lower motor neuron (LMN) lesion. Right sided seventh nerve palsy is correct as the forehead is involved. Muscles of facial expression are controlled by the seventh nerve. Right sided fifth nerve palsy is incorrect as the fifth nerve does not innervate muscles of facial expression. The remaining options are incorrect as forehead involvement suggests a LMN lesion.
urinary system,20,"A 30-year-old woman presented with hypertension (160/110 mmHg), elevated titres of antibodies to double-stranded DNA, and proteinuria (1 g per 24 hours). A renal biopsy demonstrated WHO class II lupus nephritis (mesangial disease). What is the most appropriate single treatment for this patient?",Antihypertensive medication,High-dose corticosteroids,Intravenous cyclophosphamide,Oral cyclophosphamide,Plasma exchange,A,"The renal manifestations of SLE are highly variable, ranging from mild asymptomatic proteinuria and/or haematuria to rapidly progressive uraemia. The various presentations are difficult to classify into clinical syndromes and histological classes. Although lupus nephritis affects a third of patients early in the disease it is frequently unrecognised until nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome with renal failure occur. Histologically, a number of different types of renal disease are recognised in SLE, with immune-complex mediated glomerular disease being the most common. The up to date International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification divides these into six different patterns:  I - minimal mesangial II - mesangial proliferative III - focal IV - diffuse V - membranous VI - advanced sclerosis  Glomeruli appear normal by light microscopy in minimal mesangial lupus nephritis, but immunofluorescence demonstrates mesangial immune deposits. Mesangial proliferative nephritis presents clinically as microscopic haematuria and/or proteinuria. Hypertension is uncommon and nephrotic syndrome and renal impairment are very rarely seen. Biopsy demonstrates segmental areas of increased mesangial matrix and cellularity, with mesangial immune deposits. A few isolated subepithelial or subendothelial deposits may be visible by immunofluorescence.The prognosis is good and specific treatment is only indicated if the disease progresses. Focal disease is more advanced, but still affects less than 50% of glomeruli. Haematuria and proteinuria is almost always seen, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and elevated creatinine may be present. Biopsy demonstrates active or inactive focal, segmental or global endo- or extra-capillary glomerulonephritis involving less than 50% of glomeruli, typically with focal subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations. It is further subdivided:  A: Active lesions: focal proliferative lupus nephritis A/C: Active and chronic lesions: focal proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis C: Chronic inactive lesions with glomerular scars: focal sclerosing lupus nephritis  Prognosis is variable. Diffuse glomerulonephritis is the most common and severe form of lupus nephritis. Haematuria and proteinuria are almost always present, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and renal impairment common. Biopsies demonstrate active or inactive diffuse, segmental or global endo- or extra-capillary glomerulonephritis involving more than 50% of all glomeruli, typically with diffuse subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations. This class is divided into diffuse segmental (IV-S) when more than 50% of the involved glomeruli have segmental lesions, and diffuse global (IV-G) when more than 50% of involved glomeruli have global lesions. Segmental is defined as a glomerular lesion that involves less than half of the glomerular tuft.  IV-S (A): Active lesions, diffuse segmental proliferative lupus nephritis IV-G (A): Active lesions, diffuse global proliferative IV-S (A/C): Active and chronic lesions, diffuse segmental proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis IV-S (C): Chronic inactive lesions with scars, diffuse segmental sclerosing lupus nephritis IV-G (C): Chronic inactive lesions with scars: diffuse global sclerosing lupus nephritis   Immunosuppressive therapy is required in these cases to prevent progressive to end-stage renal failure. Patients with membranous lupus nephritis tend to present with nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic haematuria and hypertension may also be seen. Biopsies show global or segmental subepithelial immune deposits or their morphologic sequelae, with or without mesangial alterations. It may occur in combination with class III or IV, in which case both are diagnosed. Progression is variable, and immunosuppression is not always needed. In advanced sclerosis, more than 90% of glomeruli are globally sclerosed without residual activity. With regard to the management of lupus nephritis, a biopsy is indicated in those patients with abnormal urinalysis and/or reduced renal function. This can provide a histological classification as well as information regarding activity, chronicity and prognosis. Cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine reduce mortality in proliferative forms of lupus glomerulonephritis. IgA nephropathy is a form of glomerulonephritis characterised by the deposition of IgA in the glomeruli. It is a very rare lesion in SLE. AA amyloidosis is a systemic disorder characterised by extracellular tissue deposition of fibrils that are composed of amyloid A protein (an acute-phase protein produced by hepatocytes). It occurs in the course of chronic inflammatory disease, but an association with SLE is very unusual. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is one of the most common glomerular diseases to result in end stage renal failure. It may occur as a primary condition, or in association with a number of vasculitic disorders (rarely SLE). Minimal change nephropathy is classically a diagnosis of childhood. There is diffuse loss of podocyte foot processes, which results in nephrotic syndrome but not usually the other features described above. "
urinary system,21,Which of the following is true regarding undescended testis?,In the inguinal canal cannot undergo torsion,Is often associated with a hernia,Is present in 5% of the male population at 6 months of age,The risk of malignancy is not significantly increased,The testes and epididymis are usually not affected,B,"Failure to find one or both testes in the scrotum may indicate any variety of congenital or acquired conditions, for example:  Ectopic testes Maldescended testes, and Retractile or absent testes.  4.5% of males have an undescended testis at birth, falling to 0.8% by six months. Maldescended or ectopic testes and true undescended testicles are differentiated from each other surgically. The ectopic testis has completed its descent through the inguinal canal but ends up in a subcutaneous location. Spontaneous testicular descent does not occur after the age of one year. Complications include infertility in adulthood, associated hernias and torsion and tumour development in the affected testis (if not operated on before 11 years). The patient with cryptorchidism has a 20-40% chance of developing malignancy, and those most at risk are those untreated or those whose surgery was carried out during or after puberty. "
urinary system,22,Which one of the following statements is correct?,Adult polycystic renal disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait,Alport's syndrome affects females more severely than males,Medullary sponge kidney is typically not inherited but is a congenital condition,Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait,Reflux nephropathy is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait,C,"Medullary sponge kidney is a disorder which can affect part, one, or both kidneys, resulting in ectatic and cystic changes of the medullary and papillary collecting ducts. It is often associated with calculi, which can result in pyelonephritis and renal tract obstruction. The aetiology is uncertain, but it is thought to be a developmental abnormality, possibly resulting from tubular or collecting duct obstruction at any early age. The majority of cases are sporadic, although a rare autosomal dominant familial form exists with onset in adulthood, and a juvenile autosomal recessive form is also recognised. Recent research has identified a possible defect in the development of the proton pump mechanism in the kidney. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is usually autosomal dominant although the infantile form is autosomal recessive. Nephrogenic DI is usually X linked. Features of Alport's syndrome (hereditary nephritis, haematuria, progressive renal failure, and high-frequency nerve deafness) are usually more marked in males. Reflux nephropathy was originally thought to be an acquired abnormality, but genetic factors are increasingly being recognised. It is thought inheritance may be dominant, although the gene has not yet been identified and it is thought that environmental factors also have a significant role."
urinary system,23,A 35-year-old woman was admitted to the Emergency department six months ago with urinary retention. She was catheterised and discharged the same day having recovered function. She now is suffering with sudden onset blurred vision and pain on looking upwards. She works in an agrochemical laboratory. She takes no medication. There is a family history of breast cancer. What test is most likely to confirm diagnosis?,Ceruloplasmin level,CT brain,Lumbar puncture,MRI brain,Organophosphate level,D,"This woman is likely to have multiple sclerosis (MS) given that she has had two neuropathies separated in time and space. The gold standard for diagnosis of MS remains clinical assessment, with evidence of white matter symptoms and signs disseminated in time and space. MRI is the investigation which will show periventricular white matter plaques of different ages and in different locations, to add weight to the clinical assessment. CT brain will not show these changes. LP should show oligoclonal bands (immunoglobulins within CSF). These can be seen in MS as well as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Lyme disease, neurosarcoidosis, Guillain-Barré syndrome and others.  Ceruloplasmin levels are used to diagnose Wilson's disease. Organophosphate levels could be used if poisoning is suspected, but her symptoms would be very different with salivation, bradycardia, bronchospasm and urination, diarrhoea and miosis."
urinary system,24,Which of the following will not be affected by a lesion of the facial nerve in the internal auditory meatus?,Blinking,Hearing,Lacrimation,Sweating over the cheek,Taste,D,"The extent of dysfunction depends on the level of injury. If it is proximal to geniculate ganglion, for example, internal auditory meatus, taste is lost in the anterior 2/3 of tongue. Also secretion from submandibular, sublingual and lacrimal glands is impaired. Hyperacusis is due to paralysis of stapedius. Orbicularis oculi is affected causing inability to blink/close eyelids. Sensation over the face is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, and sweat glands are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, for example, anhidrosis in Horner's syndrome."
urinary system,25,"A 2-year-old girl has frequency, urgency and burning micturition. She has some supra pubic tenderness. Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial investigation?",Supra pubic aspiration of urine for C&S,Clean catch of urine for C&S,USG (ultrasonogram),IVU (intravenous urogram),MCUG (micturating cysto-urethrogram),B,The features are consistent with lower UTI for which clean catch of urine for c&s should be done
urinary system,26,Which of the following immune complex glomerulonephritides is associated with a normal complement C^3?,Cryoglobulinaemia,Endocarditis,IgA nephropathy,Membranoproliferative GN,Post-streptococcal GN,C,Immune complex glomerulonephritides can be classified based on normal or decreased C^3. Of the answers above IgA nephropathy should be selected as this is associated with normal C^3. Cryoglobolinaemia is associated with reduced C^3 and C^4. Infective endocarditis is associated with a decrease in complement (C^3 and C^4). Both membranoproliferative GN and post-streptococcal GN are associated with reduced C^3.
urinary system,27,"A 52-year-old man has a slurring of his speech. Examination reveals bilateral partial ptosis and frontal balding, and difficulty releasing his grip after shaking hands. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Eaton-Lambert syndrome,Myasthenia gravis,Myotonia congenita,Myotonia dystrophica,E,"Myotonia dystrophica (myotonic dystrophy) is an autosomal dominant progressive multi-system disorder that affects skeletal muscles, the heart, gastrointestinal smooth muscle, uterine smooth muscle, the eyes and the endocrine and central nervous systems. The commonest mutation is a CTG repeat in the DMPK gene on chromosome 19., the length of which determines the age of onset and severity of symptoms. Its features include:  Ptosis Frontal balding Cataracts Cardiomyopathy Impaired intellect Testicular atrophy Diabetes mellitus, and Dysarthria (from tongue and pharyngeal myotonia).  The age of onset of symptoms in myotonic dystrophy ranges from birth to old age. Patients with classical myotonic dystrophy develop symptoms such as muscle weakness and myotonia in early to mid adult life but there are a subset who present with myotonia, cataracts and diabetes in late adulthood. In addition there is a congenital form, and patients affected by this will have severe symptoms at birth. There is no treatment for weakness which is the main cause of disability, but phenytoin, quinine or procainamide may be useful for myotonia. Both forms of myotonia congenita present in childhood with myotonia, and you would not expect to see the other features associated with myotonic dystrophy (e.g. frontal balding). Duchenne muscular dystrophy presents in childhood, and it is unusual for patients to survive to their 50s (death usually occurs as a teenager or in the early 20s from respiratory failure). Eaton-Lambert syndrome is a rare form of myasthenia, often associated with lung tumours, which results in weakness which classically improves with repeated actions. Frontal balding is not a feature. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition which results in muscle fatiguability. It is not associated with frontal balding. "
urinary system,28,"A 12-year-old boy presents to the surgery with peri-orbital and mild ankle oedema which has increased over the past few weeks. Other history of note is a recent upper respiratory tract infection. He has been feeling increasingly tired and lethargic over the past few weeks. On examination, his BP is 118/72 mmHg. He has periorbital oedema and pitting ankle oedema. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 124 g/L (110-130)   White cell count 7.8 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 191 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.6 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 104 μmol/L (60-120)   Serum albumin 28 g/L (35-50)   Urine Protein ++    Which of the following is the most likely cause?",Alport's syndrome,IgA nephropathy,Membranous nephropathy,Minimal change nephropathy,Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,D,"The history of periorbital oedema, normal blood pressure and creatinine, but proteinuria and low albumin is typical of minimal change disease. The condition is much more common in this age range than membranous nephropathy, which also causes proteinuria. The important point about making the diagnosis is that the condition responds to corticosteroid therapy in 90% or more of sufferers in childhood within two weeks, although treatment is usually continued for a period of eight weeks. The lack of haematuria counts against post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, and IgA nephropathy. Alport's syndrome is a familial nephritis associated with haematuria and progressive sensorineural hearing loss."
urinary system,29,A 34-year-old Thai lady presented with a left hemiparesis of two weeks duration. HIV antibody test was positive. CT scan of the head showed multiple ring-enhanced lesions. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her weakness?,Amoebic brain abscesses,Cerebral toxoplasmosis,Herpes simplex encephalitis,Primary brain lymphoma,Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy,B,"Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most likely diagnosis. Multiple ring-enhanced lesions are commonly seen in patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis, though solitary ring enhanced lesions are seen in 25% of patients on CT scan. MRI scan is more sensitive in identifying small lesions than CT scan. Amoebic brain abscesses are not the most likely cause in this patient. Multiple ring-enhanced lesions are not seen in patients with herpes simplex encephalitis. Primary brain lymphoma causes a significant mass effect with surrounding oedema. Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy causes multifocal white matter lesions without any mass effect or surrounding oedema. "
urinary system,30,"A 63-year-old woman is admitted to hospital with a three-day history of diarrhoea and vomiting. Her family tell you she has been virtually unable to eat or drink, but has managed to take her tablets during that time. Her past medical history includes essential hypertension and ischaemic heart disease. Her current medication consists aspirin 75 mg daily, ramipril 5 mg daily, simvastatin 40 mg daily. Her admission bloods demonstrate:    Sodium 144 mmol/l 137 - 144   Potassium 4.1 mmol/l 3.5 - 4.9   Urea 10.8 mmol/l 2.5 - 7.5   Creatinine 195 µmol/l 60 - 110    Which of the following is most appropriate?",Double dose of ramipril,Give clopidogrel 300 mg stat,Give loperamide,Withhold aspirin,Withhold ramipril,E,"The history is entirely consistent with gastroenteritis, and as a result of the protracted vomiting, the patient has become dehydrated. In this context, an ACE inhibitor (ramipril) is dangerous and should be stopped. Within the kidneys the afferent and efferent arterioles take blood to (afferent) and from (efferent) the glomerulus. ACE inhibitors work by decreasing the tone of the efferent arterioles, which in a euvolaemic patient can protect the kidney in hypertension, diabetes and other insults. However, in a hypovolaemic patient (such as this patient) this can lead to catastrophic impairment of renal function."
urinary system,31,A 25-year-old male presents to the Emergency department with weakness of his right hand. Examination reveals weakness of right wrist and finger extension. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Axillary nerve palsy,C8 nerve root lesion ,Proximal median nerve lesion,Radial nerve lesion,Ulnar nerve lesion at the elbow,D,Weakness of wrist extension with wrist drop and weakness of finger extension are typical of a radial nerve lesion.
urinary system,32,A 50-year-old lady is referred to the renal team with progressive renal impairment and for consideration of renal replacement therapy in the future. She has a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) since her teens. Her ultrasound scan shows normally sized kidneys and her urine dip is positive for protein. A renal biopsy is undertaken. Which of the following findings would be diagnostic of diabetic related kidney injury?,C4d stain positive,Congo red stain positive,Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesion,Owl's eyes inclusion,Ring sideroblasts,C,"Kimmelstiel-Wilson lesions depict nodular glomerulosclerosis which is seen in diabetic kidney disease. This option should, therefore, be selected as it is the only biopsy finding that is specific to diabetic related kidney disease. C4d staining is used for detection of BK virus after renal transplantation and is therefore incorrect. Congo red stain should not be selected as this is used to detect amyloidosis. Owl's eyes inclusion depicts the biopsy appearance of the Reed-Sternberg cell in Hodgkin's lymphoma or cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection so this is incorrect. Ring sideroblasts are peripheral blood film findings in lead toxicity so this is incorrect."
urinary system,33,A 40-year-old gentleman attends the Emergency department with a stroke affecting his left arm and leg. A CT scan confirms that there is a right sided infarct. Carotid scanning shows 85% occlusion of the right carotid and 50% stenosis on the left. What is the best course of action?,Bilateral carotid endarterectomy,Discharge and GP follow up,Discharge and outpatient follow up,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the left,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the right,E,"Carotid endarterectomy has been established as an effective treatment for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients who are shown to have carotid artery stenosis. It reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death by 48% in a person with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis (greater than70%) who has had a TIA. The peri-operative risk of disabling stroke or death is approximately 3%. Current UK guidelines recommend endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis, based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial which showed clear benefit. The endarterectomy should be performed as soon as the patient is fit for surgery, preferably within two weeks of a TIA. The benefit is marginal for symptomatic patients with 50-69% stenosis, but may be greater in male patients. NICE recommends these patients are also considered for endarterectomy. There is significantly less benefit for asymptomatic patients, even those with greater than 60% stenosis. Patients with less than 50% stenosis should not be considered for carotid surgery Recurrent stenosis can occur in 1-20% of patients following endarterectomy, and re-operation is needed in 1-3% of cases. Ipsilateral strokes occur in 9% of patients following endarterectomy, and 26% of those treated with medical management alone (within 2 years). All patients with suspected non-disabling stroke or TIA who are considered as candidates for carotid endarterectomy should have carotid imaging within 1 week. Carotid endarterectomy is also indicated following a non-disabling stroke. However, if the patient has had a disabling stroke there is no real benefit in them undergoing the procedure. Carotid stenting is increasingly being used as an alternative to endarterectomy. This is a less invasive revascularisation strategy, and uses an embolic protection device. There seems to be a similar early risk of death or stroke, and similar long-term benefits. Risk is higher in elderly patients, possibly due to vascular tortuosity and calcification. The procedure is currently indicated in selected cases, such as restenosis. Please note for this explanation we have used the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterecomy Trial (NASCET) criteria, as opposed to the European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group (ECST) criteria. See NICE guidelines for the difference - carotid imaging reports will state which criteria are being used. "
urinary system,34,A 7-year-old boy is admitted with renal colic due to renal calculus. His mother has a similar history of recurrent calculi. What is the most likely explanation for recurrent renal calculi in both mother and child?,Cystinosis,Cystinuria,Hyperoxaluria,Idiopathic hypercalciuria,Urate uropathy,D,"Idiopathic hypercalciuria^1 has a familial or sporadic pattern. In the familial pattern an autosomal dominant inheritance is present. The type of the disease is identical in affected members of the same family and the typical presentation is of recurrent urinary calculi.

urinary system,35,"A 51-year-old male comes to the surgery complaining of nausea and fatigue. You have previously seen him with symptoms of sinusitis, and a saddle nose deformity. Most recently he has begun to complain of shortness of breath and a chronic cough. On examination, he is hypertensive at 160/92 mmHg. There are bilateral inspiratory crackles on auscultation of the chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 118 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 10.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 182 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 5.5 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 230 μmol/L (60-120)   ESR 72 (less than10)   Urine Blood++   Protein ++    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Goodpasture's syndrome,IgA nephropathy,Membranous nephropathy,Minimal change disease,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,E,"Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-system disorder characterised by necrotising granulomas of medium and small blood vessels. Patients have constitutional symptoms such as fever, lethargy and weight loss. Organ-specific involvement includes:  eyes upper airway lung renal nervous system skin, and joints.  Men are affected slightly more often than women and typically present in the fourth or fifth decade. Patients often present with ocular or ENT symptoms for some time before a diagnosis is made. The autoimmune profile is likely to reveal a positive circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA), and renal biopsy is the usual way to obtain a tissue diagnosis. Treatment is with high dose steroids and cyclophosphamide, which has revolutionised this disease which is otherwise rapidly fatal."
urinary system,36,Which of the following is caused by a lesion of the occipital lobe?,Acalculia,Astereognosis,Constructional apraxia,Cortical blindness,Visuospatial neglect,D,"Lesions of the frontal lobe include difficulties with task sequencing and executive skills:  Expressive aphasia (receptive aphasia is due to a temporal lobe lesion) Primitive reflexes Perseveration (repeatedly asking the same question or performing the same task) Anosmia Changes in personality.  Lesions of the parietal lobe include:  Apraxias Neglect Astereognosis (unable to recognise an object by feeling it) Visual field defects (typically homonymous inferior quadrantanopia).  They may also cause acalculia (inability to perform mental arithmetic). Lesions of the temporal lobe cause:  Visual field defects (typically homonymous superior quadrantanopia) Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia Auditory agnosia Memory impairment.  Occipital lobe lesions include:  Cortical blindness (blindness due to damage to the visual cortex and may present as Anton's syndrome where there is blindness but the patient is unaware or denies blindness) Homonymous hemianopia Visual agnosia (seeing but not perceiving objects - it is different from neglect, since in agnosia the objects are seen and followed but cannot be named)."
urinary system,37,Which of the following statements about the spinal cord is true?,A lesion of the left side of the spinal cord at C5 causes pyramidal weakness of the right leg,Centrally placed spinal cord lesions affect joint position sense before other modalities of sensation,Conus medullaris lesions cause lower motor neurone signs with absent reflexes,The spinal cord ends at the lower border of the L3 vertebra,The spinothalamic tracts are supplied principally by the anterior spinal artery,E,"At the pyramidal decussation (lower medulla), 85% fibres cross over forming the lateral corticospinal tract, the remaining forming the ventral corticospinal tract, the fibres of which eventually cross the cord. Hence, a lesion at left side of C5 will cause weakness of the left leg. Central spinal cord lesions destroy:  Contiguous structures like the anterior horn cells (lower motor neurone signs) Decussating sensory fibres (pain and temperature) and The lateral corticospinal tracts (upper motor neurone signs).  Conus medullaris lesion causes:  Wasting and weakness of leg muscles with fasiculations (lower motor neurone signs) and Hyper-reflexia especially distally (upper motor neurone signs) supplied by the lower sacral segments (glutei)  with sensory loss of buttocks and perineum. The spinal cord terminates at lower border of L1 vertebra. Anterior spinal arteries supply corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts, and anterior horns of the grey matter."
urinary system,38,"A 70-year-old woman was referred with a six-week history of painless macroscopic haematuria. Her only medications were IM sodium aurothiomalate and oral ibuprofen, which she took for rheumatoid arthritis. Investigations:    Serum creatinine 92 µmol/L (60-110)   Urine dipstick Blood++++   Protein +     Abdominal plain x ray normal Ultrasound kidneys and renal tract normal  Which one of the following is the best initial investigation?",Cystoscopy,Intravenous urogram (IVU),Renal biopsy,Stop ibuprofen,Stop sodium aurothiomalate,A,"This lady has macroscopic haematuria and a trace of protein in the urine. She is taking ibuprofen and IM sodium aurothiomalate (gold). Her renal function is normal, as is the plain abdominal x ray and USS renal tract. Ibuprofen is a common cause of interstitial nephritis, and this could present with painless haematuria. Sodium aurothiomalate commonly causes trace proteinuria, and if present on its own is unimportant, but it can also cause membranous glomerulonephritis, which this lady could have. However. the most important thing to exclude would be a bladder tumour initially before embarking upon a renal biopsy. Therefore cystoscopy is the best initial investigation."
urinary system,39,"A 49-year-old woman has been an inpatient for the past 10 days for treatment of a bronchopneumonia. She has developed the onset of chills, fever, and skin rash over the past two days. A peripheral blood film reveals eosinophilia. On urinalysis she has ++ proteinuria. There is no past history of renal disease. Her HbA1c is normal. Which of the following diagnoses would be most strongly suggested by these findings?",Acute serum sickness,Acute tubular necrosis,Drug-induced interstitial nephritis,IgA nephropathy,Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN),C,"The findings are typical of a drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis. Acute interstitial nephritis is characterised by interstitial inflammation and oedema. Left untreated this results in interstitial fibrosis. A definitive diagnosis is established by renal biopsy, although eosinophiluria and gallium 67 scanning are also suggestive. 60-70% of cases of acute interstitial nephritis are induced by exposure to drugs. The mechanism is via a delayed T-cell hypersensitivity or cytotoxic T-cell reaction. This is not typically dose-dependent. Multiple medications have been implicated, and the presentation and laboratory findings vary according to the class of drug involved. Agents which are commonly implicated are:  beta-lactam antibiotics (especially methicillin) sulphonamides NSAIDs diuretics (thiazides, furosemide) antivirals (aciclovir, foscarnet) allopurinol, and cyclosporin.  Classic presenting features include fever, maculopapular rash, and arthralgia. Mild eosinophilia is common, and eosinophiuria is pathognomonic. Cessation of the causative agent is critical in the treatment of acute interstitial nephritis. Corticosteroids can have a beneficial effect, especially if initiated early. In general, the prognosis of drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis is good, and partial or complete recovery of renal function is normally seen. Post-streptoccocal GN appears weeks after the acute infection. Berger's disease (IgA nephropathy) is characterised by haematuria and often follows a 'flu-like' illness. Serum sickness is a possibility, but it is much less common than interstitial nephritis. "
urinary system,40,"A construction site worker was referred to the hospital because of severe leg cramps, after working in hot weather for over eight hours. He was dehydrated. Investigations revealed:    Serum albumin 59 g/L (37 - 49)   Serum calcium 3.09 mmol/L (2.2 - 2.6)   Serum creatinine 301 μmol/L (60 - 110)    What is the most appropriate immediate management? ",Check his serum protein electrophoresis to exclude myeloma,Forced diuresis,Intravenous saline infusion and check ionised calcium,Perform electrocardiogram (ECG) to look for short QT interval,Start bisphosphonate zolendronic acid,C,"The patient was suffering from heat cramps (painful muscular cramping during or after exertion in hot environments). He developed haemoconcentration and elevated protein (and albumin), leading to a phenomenon of pseudohypercalcaemia. In this condition, the total serum calcium is high but the ionised calcium should be normal. As a rule of thumb, the first step in the diagnostic evaluation of hypercalcaemia (and more often hypocalcaemia) should be to make sure that the andquot;abnormalityandquot; in the total serum calcium levels is not due to abnormal albumin concentrations. In cases of abnormal albumin level, adjusted calcium might better reflect the correct calcium level. Only ionised (or free) calcium is physiologically active and should be checked if in doubt, such as in patients with very abnormal albumin level. Extensive investigation, such as protein electrophoresis, should be omitted if pseudohypercalcaemia is confirmed. Bisphosphonate should not be started in this gentleman with acute kidney injury (and is not indicated because of pseudohypercalcaemia rather than genuine hypercalcaemia). In 2011 an FDA announcement contained a new contraindication and updated warning on kidney impairment for zoledronic acid. The drug is contraindicated in patients with creatinine clearance less than 35 mL/min or in patients with evidence of acute renal impairment. This warning follows a previous New England Journal of Medicine correspondence article describing 72 cases (FDA Adverse Event Reporting System) of renal failure associated with zoledronic acid from 2001 to 2003. Pseudohypercalcaemia is asymptomatic and should not affect the ECG. Forced diuresis is not a consideration in this case given the presence of dehydration."
urinary system,41,A 21-year-old female with epilepsy is well controlled on sodium valproate 600 mg twice daily and had been taking oral contraceptives for three years. She presented to her general practitioner 12 weeks pregnant. Which of the following is correct?,An alternative anticonvulsant should be used in place of sodium valproate,Interaction of sodium valproate with the oral contraceptive increases the risk of pregnancy,She is at increased risk of anaemia in pregnancy,The dose of sodium valproate should be increased,There is an increased risk of a neural tube defect in her fetus,E,"There is an increased risk of neural tube defects associated with anti-convulsants during pregnancy. However, the risks associated with treatment are outweighed by the benefits in preventing seizures, so the drug should be continued. The risks may be minimised through use of folate supplements. Sodium valproate is not an enzyme inducer and would not speed up metabolism of the pill. "
urinary system,42,"A 69-year-old gentleman is referred by the GP to the urology outpatient clinic with a two to three month history of painless haematuria, increased frequency of micturition and loss of weight. He also complains of generalised tiredness and lethargy. He smokes about 20-25 cigarettes a day. He appears pale and anaemic. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Per rectal examination is unremarkable. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Angiomyolipoma,Carcinoma of the bladder,Carcinoma of the prostate,Renal cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis,B,"The history of smoking and other pertinent signs and symptoms in this patient are very suggestive of a carcinoma of the bladder. Carcinoma of the bladder epithelium is the most common tumour of the genitourinary tract. Some of the recognised risk factors for the development of carcinoma of the bladder include:  Cigarette smoking (more than 20 cigarettes/day increases the risk of developing bladder cancer by 2-6 times) Working in the aniline dye industry, rubber industry and petrochemical industry Schistosomiasis infestation of the bladder Local radiation therapy Some chemotherapeutic drugs, and Longterm catheterisation in paraplegic patients.  Some recognised bladder carcinogens include:  benzidine aromatic amines nitrosamines, and various dyes and solvents.  Patients with carcinoma of the bladder may present with painless haematuria, dysuria, frequency and an urgency of micturition. The patient may have symptoms of anaemia such as dry and pale tongue and generalised tiredness. Investigations include urine microscopy and culture (to rule out any infection) and cystoscopy. Endoscopic resection of the mass followed by a four to six week course of radiotherapy to the bladder and the pelvic side walls is useful in treating a majority of the tumours."
urinary system,43,"A 77-year-old chronic smoker presented with toe gangrene. He suffered from diabetes mellitus and had a shrunken right kidney. The patient had a serum creatinine level of 340 µmol/L before this admission. Neither dorsalis pedis nor posterior tibial pulses were palpable. He was assessed by the vascular surgeon, who recommended a magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) with gadolinium (in order to minimise the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy). What opinion would you formulate?",Adequate hydration before gadolinium administration should solve the problem,Diabetes mellitus is a contraindication for magnetic resonance angiography,The magnetic resonance angiography with gadolinium is not recommended because it carries a risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis,This patient should be administered N-acetylcysteine before receiving gadolinium,This patient should be offered imaging with gadolinium because he had a high risk for iodinated radio contrast-induced nephropathy,C,"According to the latest guidelines, the need for a gadolinium-based contrast study should be carefully considered in any patient with chronic kidney disease stage 3 or greater. Our patient, in other words, had a high risk for this condition of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) with potentially fatal consequence. Because of a higher dose requirement of gadolinium in angiography, the odds of NSF are even higher for the patient. This toxicity of gadolinium cannot be circumvented by hydration or N-acetylcysteine; they are considered to be more appropriate for preventing radio contrast-induced nephropathy."
urinary system,44,"A 45 year old woman presents with urinary leakage on cough, urinary urgency, frequency more than six to eight times during the day and two to three times at night. Her video urodynamic trace is shown below , What is the most likely diagnosis?",Mixed urinary incontinence,Detrusor overactivity incontinence,Urodynamic stress urinary incontinence,Cough provoked detrusor overactivity,Systolic detrusor overactivity,C,"This is defined as involuntary leakage of urine during increased abdominal pressure, in the absence of a detrusor contraction during filling phase. The image from the video film shows the opening of bladder neck and leakage of urine without a rise in the detrusor pressure"
urinary system,45,Which of the following is true in the male reproductive system?,Luteinising hormone is not important in spermatogenesis,Oligospermia is improved by testosterone therapy,Prostatic secretions are essential for seminal liquefaction,Spermatogenesis is completed in about 30 days,The presence of testosterone is essential for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) to initiate spermatogenesis,C,Luteinising hormone stimulates Leydig cell - steroidogenesis. Testosterone is normal for spermatogenesis. Oligospermia may respond to gonadotrophin. Spermatogenesis takes 70 to 80 days. Sperm production is under FSH control.
urinary system,46,A 62-year-old man with a longstanding history of hypertension is seen in the outpatient clinic. Investigations show:    Creatinine 280 µmol/L (60-110)    Urinalysis:    Blood ++   Protein 1.8 g/L    Ultrasound scan of kidneys shows left kidney 8.5 cm; right kidney 8.9 cm. What is the best investigation to diagnose the cause of his renal impairment?,Intravenous urogram (IVU),Isotope renogram,Renal angiogram,Renal biopsy,Retrograde pyelogram,D,"This patient has a long history of hypertension, therefore it should have been appropriately controlled in the clinic. The patient now presents with bilaterally shrunken kidneys, renal impairment and evidence of a glomerulonephritis. In the presence of mild to moderate hypertension, proteinuria indicates either underlying renal disease or renovascular disease. As this patient has blood and protein in the urine, on the background of impaired renal function and shrunken kidneys, the best investigation would be to perform a renal biopsy (assuming the hypertension was controlled). This would differentiate between renovascular disease and glomerulonephritis, which may be reversible. If this patient had the above clinical findings without blood and protein in the urine, then the investigation of choice would be a renal angiogram, to diagnose renovascular disease."
urinary system,47,A 40-year-old man presents with a two year history of intermittent strictly unilateral headaches. The pain is excruciatingly severe. It is located around the orbital region. The headache usually lasts 45-60 minutes. It usually occurs in the early hours of the morning. There is associated ptosis and lacrimation on the side of the headache. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Cluster headaches,Giant cell arteritis,Migraine,Tension type headache,Trigeminal neuralgia,A,Cluster headache has three important features:  Trigeminal distribution pain Ipsilateral cranial autonomic features and The striking tendency to circadian and circannual periodicity.

urinary system,48,Which statement on dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysms is correct?,A dissecting aneurysm of the ascending thoracic aorta should initially be managed with induced hypotension,A dissecting aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta requires immediate surgical repair,Dissecting thoracic aneurysms can be classified according to the DeBakey classification,Invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring should be placed in the left arm,Severe metabolic alkalosis may occur during aortic cross-clamping,C,"Thoracic aortic dissections are classified according to either the DeBakey or the Stanford classifications. DeBakey has three types:  Type 1 involves the ascending and descending aorta; Type 2 is limited to the ascending aorta; Type 3 is limited to the descending aorta with a tear distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.  Stanford type A incorporates the DeBakey types 1 and 2, and Stanford type B is similar to the DeBakey type 3. Ascending aortic dissections require immediate surgical repair. Descending aortic dissections should initially be managed by induced hypotension and beta adrenoreceptor blockade. Systemic arterial pressure measurement should be via a cannula inserted into the right radial artery, as the left subclavian artery may be involved in the dissection or clamped at surgery. A severe metabolic acidosis (not alkalosis), may develop during aortic cross clamping, which may require bicarbonate administration."

Which of the following is least likely to be the cause of acute tubular necrosis?,Corticosteroid therapy,Hypertension,Hypovolaemia,Paracetamol poisoning,Rhabdomyolysis,A,"Renal failure from ATN occurs in 25% of patients with severe hepatic damage. Accelerated hypertension can cause small vessel obstruction with proliferative endarteritis of intralobular arteries and fibrinoid necrosis of afferent arterioles and glomerular capillary tuft. Corticosteroid therapy has not been associated with ATN. Other causes of ATN include:  hypotension hepatic failure eclampsia, and drugs such as aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, cisplatin, amphotericin."

The non-dominant lobe has a number of visual-spatial functions. Involve of the optic tract, in either lobe, causes a contralateral homonymous inferior quadrantanopia. Typical signs associated with different lesions are: Post-central gyrus (anterior parietal lobe), dominant or non-dominant:  Impaired proprioception Impaired two point discrimination Agraphism Astereognosis Sensory +/- visual inattention  Superior parietal lobule, dominant or non-dominant:  Balint syndrome: optic ataxia Impaired spatial processing  Inferior parietal lobule, dominant or non-dominant:  Sensory extinction Asteroagnosia Dysgraphaesthesia  Dominant inferior parietal lobule:  Acalculia Agraphia Left/right confusion Finger agnosia Receptive dysphasia Alexia or dyslexia Gerstmann's syndrome  Non-dominant inferior parietal lobule:  Geographical agnosia Phonagnosia Constructional apraxia Anosognosia Spatial neglect of the contralateral limb Dressing apraxia  Expressive dysphasia is caused by damage to the posterior inferior frontal gyrus.

urinary system,51,A lesion of the frontal lobe causes which of the following?,Apraxia,Broca's (expressive) aphasia,Cortical blindness,Homonymous hemianopia,Visuospatial neglect,B,"Lesions of the frontal lobe include:  expressive aphasia primitive reflexes perseveration (repeatedly asking the same question or performing the same task) difficulties with task sequencing and executive skills changes in personality.  Lesions of the parietal lobe include:  apraxia neglect astereognosis (unable to recognise an object by feeling it), and visual field defects (typically homonymous inferior quadrantanopia).  They may also cause alcalculia (inability to perform mental arithmetic). Lesions of the temporal lobe cause:  visual field defects (typically homonymous superior quadrantanopia) Wernike's (receptive) aphasia auditory agnosia, and memory impairment.  Occipital lobe lesions include:  cortical blindness (blindness due to damage to the visual cortex and may present as Anton syndrome where there is blindness but the patient is unaware or denies blindness) homonymous hemianopia, and visual agnosia (seeing but not perceiving objects - it is different to neglect since in agnosia the objects are seen and followed but cannot be named)."
urinary system,52,Which of the following is correct regarding chronic kidney disease (CKD)?,Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is raised due to liver dysfunction,"Serum calcium is often low, secondary to reduced levels of 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D","Serum phosphate is reduced in the early stages of chronic kidney disease, at GFR of 45 ml/min/1.73 m^2",There is an increase in the tubular excretion of urate,There is usually a reduction in blood pressure,B,"Hypocalcaemia is common in chronic kidney disease. It is mainly caused by failure of the 1α-hydroxylation of vitamin D to form 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol, a step that usually occurs in renal tubular cells. This results in reduced calcium absorption from the gut, which is often exacerbated by poor oral intake of calcium in patients with CKD. Together with hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia drives increased release of parathyroid hormone (secondary hyperparathyroidism), which in turns contributes to renal osteodystrophy. Hypertension is both a cause and consequence of chronic kidney disease. The pathogenesis of hypertension caused by CKD is complex and multifactorial. It is caused by:  Increased intravascular volume (due to reduced glomerular filtration) Excessive activity of the renin angiotensin system Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system Endothelial dysfunction, and Other neural and humoral factors.  Hypertension can then result in progression of CKD, again via complex mechanisms which include loss of renal autoregulation with elevation of intraglomerular capillary pressure and hyperfiltration-mediated injury. Serum alkaline phosphatase is raised when renal osteodystrophy develops, specifically the bone isoenzyme rather than the liver form. Abnormalities in PO(4) metabolism occur early in CKD. Reduced glomerular filtration rate results in reduced phosphate excretion. In the early stages of CKD there are compensatory changes in renal phosphate handling which can maintain a normal serum level, but as the disease progresses hyperphosphataemia develops. Together with hypocalcaemia, this contributes to the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Patients who are acidotic due to renal failure have reduced tubular secretion of urate due to competition with other organic acids at tubular receptors."
urinary system,53,Which of the following is true concerning transitional cell cancer (TCC) of the urinary bladder?,Causing ureteric obstruction is usually non-invasive,Following complete resection requires no surveillance,Is most common in non-smokers,Occupational history may be of relevance,Rarely presents with haematuria,D,"Haematuria is the commonest presenting feature in TCC and TCC is found in approximately 20% of patients presenting with frank haematuria. It is strongly associated with cigarette smoking and occupational exposure to certain chemicals (for example, naphthylamine) greatly increases the risk of TCC. Ureteric obstruction, when present, is usually in the presence of an invasive TCC. TCC recurs frequently and in a proportion of patients will progress. Cystoscopic surveillance is carried out on all patients following a diagnosis of TCC."
urinary system,54,"A 72-year-old man presented with shortness of breath of two-month duration. He has been treated for rheumatoid arthritis for the past 30 years. On examination, his blood pressure was 190/110 mmHg, he had bilateral pitting ankle oedema, fourth heart sound, bilateral basal crackles and arthritic changes in the hands, wrists, ankles and left knee. Basic investigations revealed the following results:    Sodium 128mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 30 mmol/L (2.5-7.0)   Creatinine 610 µmol/L (60-110)   Glucose 7.8 mmol/L (3-6)   Urinalysis protein +++    Ultrasound KUB shows right and left kidneys 10 cm and 10.6 cm respectively. There is no obstruction. What is the cause of renal failure?",Acute glomerulonephritis,Amyloidosis,Analgesic nephropathy,Chronic pyelonephritis,Hypertensive nephropathy,B,"The presence of nephrotic syndrome in this scenario should lead you to consider amyloidosis. This is likely to be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis, which results in high levels of serum amyloid A protein. The kidneys are usually normal size, or slightly large. There can be associated cardiac dysfunction or restrictive cardiomyopathy. Hypertension is rare and is likely a distractor in this situation. Hypertensive nephropathy is associated with minor proteinuria only (less than0.5 g/day). Acute glomerulonephritis presents more acutely, with both blood and protein in the urine. Patients with chronic pyelonephritis typically have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. Nephrotic syndrome is not classical, and the kidneys are typically small and scarred."

Which of the following is true of vasectomy?,Can be performed as an outpatient procedure,Commonly causes impotence,Involves ligation and division of the spermatic cord,Is frequently complicated by a hydrocele,Leads to immediate sterility,A,"Male sterilisation by vasectomy is a safe, simple outpatient procedure when properly performed. The vas deferens is identified at the top of the scrotum by palpation. Under local anaesthesia a small incision allows the vas to be separated from its blood vessels, so that a centimetre of it can be removed between ligatures. Complications are few."

urinary system,57,Which one of the following would support a diagnosis of subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SACDC) rather than multiple sclerosis (MS)?,Absent ankle jerks,Autonomic symptoms,Cerebellar signs,Extensor plantars,Visual problems,A,"The causes of absent ankle reflexes and extensor plantars include  Subacute combined degeneration of the cord (posterior column signs, positive Romberg's sign, anaemia, splenomegaly) Syphilitic taboparesis Friedreich's ataxia Motor neurone disease.  Knee reflexes in SACDC may be increased, normal or absent. In the latter stages of MS with marked muscle wasting, tendon jerks may be difficult to elicit. All the other features may be common to both conditions - optic atrophy, cerebellar ataxia and spasticity. The only tricky one is autonomic features because these are rare in both conditions. Remember MS affects the CNS whereas subacute combined degeneration of the cord affects central and peripheral nerves. That is the easiest way of answering the question."
urinary system,58,A 22-year-old woman presents with features of nephrotic syndrome and a renal biopsy is performed. What would you expect to see on light and electron microscopy if you were expecting a diagnosis of minimal change disease?,Fusion of foot processes of podocytes is seen on light microscopy,In advanced disease there is hyalinisation of glomeruli seen on light microscopy,The glomerular basement membrane is normal on electron microscopy,Tubules may show calcification in lining cells on light microscopy,Wire-loop lesions are seen on light microscopy,C,"Minimal change disease is typically seen in children less than 6-years-old and in a minority of adults with nephrotic syndrome. There is no glomerular abnormality on light microscopy. Electron microscopy shows effacement of the foot processes of podocytes (visceral epithelial cells) and a normal basement membrane. Treatment is with steroids; disease remission often occurs within two weeks although relapse may occur.  Fusion of foot processes of podocytes is seen on electron microscopy, not light microscopy. There is no hyalinisation; this is an abnormality seen in other renal diseases, such as amyloidosis. The glomerular basement membrane is normal on electron microscopy, though there is an abnormality of podocytes with fusion of foot processes. Tubules may show accumulation of lipid in lining cells on light microscopy, but not calcification. Light microscopy reveals no glomerular abnormalities. Wire-loop lesions are seen in post-infectious glomerulonephritis and lupus nephritis."
urinary system,59,Which of the following statements is correct regarding testicular torsion?,Always presents with abdominal pain and vomiting and few testicular symptoms,Occurs frequently in neonates,Requires contralateral orchidopexy if a torsion is confirmed,Requires scanning with Doppler ultrasound or isotope scanning,Viability is expected if operated on within 24 hours of onset of symptoms.,C,"The commonest causes of 'acute scrotum' in childhood are testicular torsion, torsion of an appendix testis and idiopathic scrotal oedema. Testicular torsion can occur at any age, with a peak incidence between 14 and 20 years. It usually presents with severe testicular pain, but this may be absent. The boy may just have abdominal pain. The testis must be examined in all boys and men with abdominal symptoms. If torsion is clinically suspected, then radiological investigations have little to offer. None are diagnostic, and may delay surgery. Testicular viability is reduced with increasing time from the onset of symptoms. One paper has reported 100% viability for patients presenting within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. This reduced to 83% for those presenting within 24 hours. Most delays occur outside hospital. Any in-hospital delay is indefensible. Following reduction of a torsion, 3-point fixation with an non-absorbable suture should be performed. The contralateral testis should also be fixed."
urinary system,60,A 56 year old presents two weeks post renal transplant with peripheral oedema. Her creatinine has doubled since its last measurement and she is hypertensive. What treatment should be commenced  initially?,Ciclosporin,Mycophenolate Mofetil,IV Methylprednisolone,Azathioprine,Oral prednisolone,C,This history is indicative of acute rejection. Once a biopsy confirms this IV methylprednisolone should be commenced as this is effective in suppressing the rejection reaction and reducing creatinine.
urinary system,61,"A 32-year-old woman, who is on the combined oral contraceptive pill and who is a smoker, presents with a history of pain and swelling in her right calf, starting two days earlier. On the morning of admission, she developed sudden onset of weakness on her right side. On examination she has a dense hemiplegia, with weakness of her right hand and upper motor neuron signs. There is evidence of a deep vein thrombosis of her right calf. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Berry aneurysm,Cerebral tumour with hypercoagulable state,Haemorrhagic stroke,Paradoxical embolism,Pulmonary embolism,D,"This patient has a history suggestive of deep vein thrombosis with calf pain and swelling and the risk of the combined oral contraceptive pill. The sudden onset of a right-sided hemiplegia suggests that the embolus, whilst passing through the heart, has paradoxically crossed via an atrial septal defect (ASD) or ventricular septal defect (VSD) to the systemic side of the circulation giving rise to an embolic cerebrovascular accident (CVA). Pulmonary embolism would occur without ASD.  An aneurysm of haemorrhagic stroke are possible but less llikely given the history of DVT.  A tumour would have a more chronic symptomatology."
urinary system,62,"An 18-year-old female presents with a three-day history of progressive weakness and numbness of her legs, urinary retention and back pain for two weeks following an upper respiratory infection. On examination there is spastic paraparesis, sensory level up to T5, extensor plantars. Examination of cranial nerves and upper limbs is normal. MRI of the spine is normal. Of the following, which is the most likely diagnosis?",Anterior spinal artery occlusion,Guillain-Barré syndrome,Multiple sclerosis,Post-infectious transverse myelitis,Thoracic disc prolapse,D,"Transverse myelitis describes a heterogeneous group of conditions that are characterised by acute or subacute motor, sensory and autonomic spinal cord dysfunction. The clinical signs are caused by an interruption in ascending and descending pathways in the transverse plane of the spinal cord. A sensory level is characteristic. Midline or dermatomal neuropathic pain can be present. Urinary incontinence or retention, bowel incontinence or constipation, and sexual dysfunction are common but vary in severity. These signs develop over hours to days, and are usually bilateral. There are a variety of causes, but it most often occurs as an autoimmune phenomenon after an infection or vaccination, or as a result of direct infection, an underlying systemic autoimmune disease, or an acquired demyelinating disease. For a significant proportion of cases no cause is found. MRI is indicated to rule out the presence of structural lesions, and determine the presence of myelitis which enhances with gadolinium in the acute phase. There may be more than one area of myelitis, and the lesions usually span at least two vertebral segments. In the acute phase the MRI may be normal. Treatment in the acute phase aims to halt the progression and initiate resolution of the inflammatory cord lesion. Corticosteroids are first line, and are initially given in high doses intravenously. Plasma exchange can be given to those who fail to respond. Patients with demyelinating disease can be started on long term immunosuppression. The prognosis is highly variable, and improvement can take three months and longer to develop. A rapidly progressive course, severe weakness, hypotonia and areflexia are predictors of poor prognosis. Fifty per cent to 70% of patients have partial or complete recovery. Whilst multiple sclerosis may be a possible underlying cause in this young lady, the proximity to an infection and the lack of history of other neurological deficits makes it less likely. Guillain-Barré syndrome presents with ascending progressive symmetrical weakness, with lower motor neurone signs. Anterior spinal artery occlusion typically presents with a flaccid paraplegia or quadriplegia (depending on the level). It is usually associated with atherosclerosis or aortic dissection, and would therefore be unusual in this age group. A thoracic disc prolapse would be seen on MRI. "
urinary system,63,A 40-year-old male presents with abnormal movements. On examination the patient has slow writhing movements of the arms and is unable to sit still in the chair without abnormal posturing. His father was reported to have had similar features at the age of 50 and died aged 60. What is the most likely diagnosis?,"MELAS syndrome (mitochondrial encephalomyelopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes)",Motor neuron disease,Myasthenia gravis,Huntington's disease,Rheumatic fever,D,"The patient described has features characteristic of Huntington's disease. This is a genetic disorder due to a trinucleotide repeat expansion in the Huntington gene of more than 35 CAG repeats. It is autosomal dominant and shows genetic anticipation (i.e. it tends to present at an earlier age in successive generations). There is often a prodromal phase of mild psychotic and behavioural symptoms, prior to the development of progressive chorea, rigidity and dementia. Seizures are often present. In the late stages, chorea is replaced by dystonia and Parkinsonian features.  MELAS syndrome is a mitochondrial cytopathy caused by defects in the mitrochondrial genome. Motor neuron disease is a disorder of motor neurons the pathophysiology of which is unclear but which is in some cases related to SOD-1 gene. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune condition in which antibodies, typically anticholinesterase antibodies, interfere with neuromuscular transmission. Rheumatic fever can present with choreiform movements (Sydenham's chorea) but it is caused by Group A Streptococci and antibody cross-reactivity. Myotonic dystrophy and huntington's disease are both trinucleotide repeat expansions. DM is CTG and HD is CAG"
urinary system,64,A 25 year old male presents to his GP after noticing a lump in his right testicle. He has recently suffered trauma to his right testicle. On examination there is evidence of a small hydrocoele and there is a discrete lump palpable. Bloods reveal an elevated beta HCG and normal AFP. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Testicular Torsion,Epididymo-orchitis,Testicular Teratoma,Testicular Seminoma,Renal Cell Carcinoma,D,"The finding of a painless testicular lump especially in a person of this age group should always raise the suspicion of testicular carcinoma. The trauma is a red herring as although people may report trauma before presenting it is most likely that this has caused the patient to examine the testicles and discover the lump. In torsion you would expect severe pain and skin discolouration. The majority of tumours are of germ cell origin with 45% being seminomas and 50% being non-seminomas with the majority being teratomas and yolk sac accounting for a minority. In pure seminomas AFP is not elevated and in only 5-10% of cases is beta HCG elevated. In Teratomas both AFP and beta HCG can be elevated. LDH should also be measured as it is important for prognosis. The biggest risk factor for the development of testicular cancer is cryptorchidism. Other risk factors include Klinefelter's syndrome, family history and previous malignancy in contralateral testicle. Tall men are thought to be at increased risk and it was thought this was due to IGF1 levels however there is conflicting evidence. In non seminoma such as teratoma patients are treated with orchidectomy plus retroperitoneal lymph node dissection + chemotherapy in stage II and above. In seminomas these are radiosensitive thus orchidectomy is followed by radiotherapy to abdominal and pelvic nodes and chemotherapy in more advanced stages."
urinary system,65,You are asked to see an orthopaedic patient who developed renal failure after a two-week course of gentamicin. No features of hypovolaemia or sepsis are evident. You suspect a diagnosis of aminoglycoside-induced acute tubular necrosis. Which of the following fit the diagnosis?,The patient's acute renal failure usually appears within two days of gentamicin,The patient is non-oliguric,The urine microscopy shows active red cell casts,We expect an irreversible renal failure,All of above,B,"The correct answer is that the patient is non-oliguric. The reversible acute tubular necrosis after aminoglycoside reflects a concurrent impairment in the concentrating ability, and most patients are non-oliguric. We expect a diagnosis of acute renal failure beginning more than five days after the initiation of gentamicin; the suggestion that acute renal failure usually appears within two days of gentamicin is therefore incorrect. The urine sediment should either be benign or show granular or epithelial cell casts. The doctor's role is to ensure no hypovolaemia, sepsis, or catabolic state, all of which will defer tubular regeneration (recovery). Irreversible tubulointerstitial damage, however, is uncommon after discontinuing aminoglycoside."
urinary system,66,"A 37 year old male has a history of rhinorrhoea , recurrent sinusitis, joints pains and cough with occasional haemoptysis. On dipstick of his urine there is evidence of proteinuria and haematuria. Bloods reveal acute renal failure and autoantibodies reveal a positive cANCA. Given the likely diagnosis, what would you expect to find on renal biopsy?",Segmental pauci immune crescentic necrotising glomerulonephritis,Mesangial proliferation,IgA deposition in basement membrane,Focal glomerulosclerosis,Focal segmental glomerulonephritis,A,"The most likely diagnosis is Wegeners granulomatosis. This is a small vessel vasculitis and effects multiple organs. There is necrotising granuloma formation. The history of rhinorrhoea, sinusitis, haemoptysis and cough and haemoptysis are suggestive of this. CANCA is often found. In the kidneys most often leads to a segmental pauci immune crescentic necrotising glomerulonephritis."
urinary system,67,"A 55-year-old male is admitted to hospital with a four-week history of breathlessness and dry cough. He has a medical history of longstanding asthma and intermittent tension headaches for which he takes simple analgesia. On clinical examination, he appears pale and unwell. His blood pressure is 170/95 mmHg. Heart sounds are normal and the chest is clear. A few non-blanching skin lesions less than 5 mm in size are found on lower limbs. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 80 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 10 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 7 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Lymphocytes 1.8 ×10^9/L (1.5-4)   Eosinophils 1.2 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   ESR 55 mm/hr (0-15)   CRP 45 mg/L (less than10)   Sodium 134 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Creatinine 650 mmol/lL (60-110 μmol/L)    Urine dipstick shows blood ++ and protein +++. Renal ultrasound: both kidneys normal in size, no evidence of urinary obstruction. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Analgesic nephropathy,Churg-Strauss syndrome,Goodpasture's disease,IgA nephritis,Renal amyloidosis,B,"Analgesic nephropathy is incorrect. This may cause insidious onset of renal failure but is not associated with elevated inflammatory markers, eosinophilia, or asthma. Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS) is the correct answer. Acute presentation with glomerulonephritis, eosinophilia, skin vasculitis, and elevated inflammatory markers on a background of longstanding asthma makes Churg-Strauss the most likely diagnosis. CSS is a rare form of small-vessel vasculitis, characterised by asthma, allergic rhinitis and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia. Rarely, it can cause either an anterior or a posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, which presents with visual loss. The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. CSS, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The unifying feature of patients presenting with CSS is asthma. Vasculitis involving the peripheral nervous system is also a characteristic feature, and mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 75% of patients.  Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with CSS. 40-60% are associated with positive ANCA, usually pANCA/MPO. Intravenous glucocorticoid is used for initial therapy of acute multi-organ disease, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy, often with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent. Loss of vision must be treated aggressively. IgA nephritis is incorrect. IgA nephropathy can be associated with glomerulonephritis but does not explain the skin changes or the asthma. Goodpasture's disease is incorrect. Goodpasture's disease is also a cause of a rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis. However, it is not classically associated with eosinophilia and would not explain the past history of asthma. Renal amyloidosis is incorrect. The presentation in amyloidosis is usually chronic rather than acute and the renal ultrasound scan does not support amyloidosis which is usually associated with enlarged kidneys."
urinary system,68,"A 72 year old gentleman with type 2 diabetes mellitus has presented with pyrexia, flank pain and haematuria. Bloods reveal an acute deterioration of his renal function. Urine dipstick reveals blood, protein and low urine specific gravity. An ultrasound suggests hydronephrosis. A CT scan is performed and reveals evidence of renal pelvic filling defects, ring shadows and irregular papillae. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Renal stones,Pyelonephritis,Hydronephrosis,Papillary necrosis,Glomerulonephritis,D,"The presentation and CT findings are suggestive of renal papillary necrosis. This is characterised by coagulative necrosis of the renal medullary pyramids and papillae. The underlying pathophysiology is the development of ischaemia. It can affect one papillae to many and can be unilateral although is more commonly bilateral. There is necrosis of papillae and there is a papillary and a medullary form. Papillae can slough off and lead to obstruction. The acute form can presents like pyelonephritis or as a chronic form with deterioration of renal function. There is numerous aetiological factors including, diabetes, vasculitis, shock, analgesia and pyelonephritis. IVU was previously used but now CT is increasingly used."
urinary system,69,"A 19-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with a severe headache, vomiting and right hemiplegia. She has recently begun the progesterone only pill, but has no other past medical history of note. On examination her blood pressure is 155/80 mmHg, her pulse is 80 and regular and she is in obvious pain. There is a 3/5 power weakness affecting both her right upper and lower limb. Her reflexes are normal. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 6.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 241 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 9 mm/hr (less than10)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 82 µmol/L (79-118)   MRI brain normal    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for her?",Acetazolamide,Diclofenac,Ergotamine,Sumatriptan,Zolmitriptan,B,"This unfortunate young woman has hemiplegic migraine, for which non-steroidals and antiemetics are the acute treatment of choice. Options for prophylaxis include tricyclics, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, calcium channel blockers and beta blockers. Ergot derived compounds and triptans are contraindicated for the treatment of hemiplegic migraine because of the risk of precipitating a stroke. Whilst acetazolamide has found favour as a treatment for hemiplegic migraine, data are unconvincing."
urinary system,70,The mutation of which of the following can lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus?,Aquaporin 2,Collagen type IV,Insulin receptor,Aquaporin 1,Glomerular basement membrane protein,A,An autosomal recessive mutation in aquaporin 2 can lead to a genetic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. An X-linked mutation in V2 ADH receptor gene can also lead to this.
urinary system,71,"A 75-year-old man is brought to see you by his wife. She is no longer able to manage his urinary incontinence. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease by his GP a few years ago when he became slow and shuffling and used to struggle to get to the toilet in time. She says he 'lost a lot of the warning' from his bladder and would sometimes be incontinent. However, his wife says he now no longer seems to care whether he is being incontinent of urine or not. She admits that he has been 'forgetful' for a few years but that this is also getting much worse. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alzheimer's dementia,Lewy body dementia,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,Obstructive uropathy,Parkinson's plus syndrome,C,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus is the correct answer. It causes the triad of dementia, gait abnormality and urinary incontinence. It is a cause of reversible dementia as symptoms may resolve with a shunt, so is an important diagnosis not to miss. The gait can often be confused with that of a Parkinson's patient. Urinary problems often begin as urgency and frequency and may progress to frontal lobe incontinence (patients are indifferent to their incontinence). Sometimes diagnosing conditions, particularly dementias, may be difficult in the early stages. Always be ready to consider reviewing a previous diagnosis (such as this patient's previous diagnosis of Parkinson's disease) in light of new symptoms. Alzheimer's dementia initially causes forgetfulness. Patients then undergo progressive cognitive decline with disintegration of personality. However, urinary incontinence and gait disturbance are not typical features. Patients with Lewy body dementia typically complain of visual hallucinations and fluctuating cognition. They usually have a degree of parkinsonism, but urinary incontinence is not typically prominent. Obstructive uropathy may cause overflow incontinence of the bladder and confusion, particularly in patients with already impaired cognition. However, it would not explain the patient's indifference to his incontinence. Parkinson's plus syndrome is a group of neurodegenerative disorders with classical parkinsonian signs and some additional features. However, this history does not fit well with any of these conditions."
urinary system,72,"On physical examination, the right testis of an 18-month-old boy is not in the scrotum. Which of the following is true?",An inguinal hernia is unlikely to occur with testicular maldescent,"If the right testis is palpable, no surgical procedure would be required",Orchidopexy should be performed when the patient is about six years old,The maldescended right testis is often palpable in the groin,The most likely cause is an ectopic testis,D,"By 18 months of age, both testes should have descended. If they are not both in the scrotum, it is important to determine whether they are undescended, retractile and ectopic, or absent. The maldescended testis is often palpable in the groin, and it is often associated with indirect inguinal hernias. Orchidopexy needs to be carried out in the second year of life to minimise the risk of complications. Depending on the location of the testis, surgery may or may not be required. If the testis is considered to be retractile, the patient needs to be monitored, and if maldescended, orchidopexy is required."
urinary system,73,A 50-year-old gentleman presents to the emergency department having had a fall. Examination revealed ataxia and some mild extrapyramidal signs. He was receiving treatment for suspected Parkinson's disease following a fall he had had six months ago when he demonstrated extrapyramidal signs. His symptoms had been noted to have improved with the medication. Tilt table testing was performed and found to be positive. What is the likely diagnosis?,Cerebellar degeneration,Multi-system atrophy,Parkinson's disease,Postural hypotension,Wilson's disease,B,Multi-system atrophy includes three syndromes that usually overlap  Strionigral degeneration leading to parkinsonism Autonomic failure Olivopontocerebellar degeneration.  The average age of onset is 50 years (earlier than in Parkinson's disease) and the median survival six to nine years. It runs a briefer course than Parkinson's disease. The clinical presentation is highly varied and may begin with any of the above clinical signs. The unifying pathologic hallmark is the presence of a-synuclein-positive inclusions located in various brain regions. Early in the course of the illness parkinsonian features may respond to dopaminomimetic agents. These have to be used with caution due to their tendency to provoke orthostatic hypotension.
urinary system,74,"A 16-year-old female presents with a three year history of recurrent colicky loin pain. One year ago she passed a renal calculus. Twenty-four hour urine collection showed normal levels of calcium, phosphate and urate, but elevated levels of arginine, cystine, lysine and ornithine. Which one of the following features is characteristic of this condition?",Accumulation of cystine in collecting system,Autosomal dominant inheritance,Cystine deposits within the Cornea,Functional defects within the glomeruli,Radiolucent renal stone formation on CT scan,A,"This condition is typical of cystinuria (nephropathic cystinosis), an autosomal recessive genetic defect in membrane transport for cystine, lysine, ornithine and arginine in epithelial cells. The glomerulus is unable to resorb these amino acids, and they are therefore excreted into the urine. The rBAT gene is responsible, and there are three forms distinguished by the pattern of tubular amino acid transport. Cystinuria usually presents with recurrent nephrolithiasis in the form of cystine stones (which are often bilateral, multiple, and can form staghorns). These can present as early as the first decade. Renal failure can occur. The stones are radiolucent stones, which may also be seen with uric acid stones. However, they are usually opaque on a CTKUB. Cystine deposits within the cornea are not classically seen, neither are functional defects within the glomeruli. Diagnosis of cystinuria can be made by stone analysis; such stones are pale yellow and analysis reveals high cystine levels. It can then be confirmed by an amino acid chromatogram and quantification of cystine excretion. First-line management is conservative, with encouragement of large volume fluid intake (particularly in the evening, with the aim to pass urine at least once overnight). Urine pH should be regularly monitored (aiming for 7.5-8), with sodium bicarbonate being used if necessary (not in hypertensive patients or those with renal failure). The aim of such treatment is to reduce the urinary cystine concentration to below 300 mg/L. If this fails, d-penicillamine, alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine or captopril can be used. Cystine stones are not easily broken by lithotripsy, and therefore percutaneous removal is most often used if they do develop."
urinary system,75,"A 70-year-old man presents with difficulty speaking. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination the patient is awake, his blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg. His pulse is irregularly irregular. He has 4/5 strength in the right arm and leg and 5/5 strength on the left. When asked to point to the window he does this correctly. When told to raise his arms and place his hands out he is seen to have a pronator drift on the right. He is shown a pen and asked what it is. He is unable to identify it by name and appears frustrated: applying much effort to speak a sentence. He is asked to use it appropriately and begins to write on a piece of paper but no makes no legible words despite being a retired journalist. When asked to repeat 'Today is a sunny day', he is unable to do so. With which of the following is this type of dysphasia consistent?",Broca's aphasia,Global aphasia,Transcortical motor aphasia,Transcortical sensory aphasia,Wernicke's aphasia,A,"In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In Wernicke's or fluent or receptive aphasia the patient is able to form correct grammatical sentences but language content is incorrect. It localises to the dominant superior temporal gyrus. There is poor comprehension and repetition but verbal output is fluent. In transcortical motor aphasia which localises to the anterior superior frontal lobe, the patient is able to repeat and have good comprehension but is unable to express themselves and have halting, effortful speech with intact repetition. Transcortical sensory aphasia has intact repetition but the patient is unable to follow verbal commands with fluent grammatical speech. Global aphasia results in an almost mute patient: there is poor verbal output, comprehension, repetition and understanding."
urinary system,76,A 61-year-old man presents to the emergency department complaining of lethargy and muscle weakness. He has begun therapy for hypertension with bendroflumethiazide a few weeks earlier. Blood testing reveals a potassium of 2.5 mmol/l. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his hypokalaemia?,Increased sodium within the ascending loop of Henle,Increased sodium within the descending loop of Henle,Increased sodium within the distal collecting duct,Increased sodium within the distal convoluted tubule,Increased sodium within the proximal convoluted tubule,D,"Thiazides block sodium reabsorption in the proximal segment of the distal convoluted tubule. This promotes increased delivery of sodium to the distal segment of the distal convoluted tubule. There the aldosterone sensitive sodium potassium exchange pump is presented with increased luminal sodium, which leads to increased excretion of potassium and hydrogen ions. Often thiazide diuretics are combined in the treatment of hypertension with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), in which case hypokalaemia does not normally present itself as a problem. "
urinary system,77,A 25-year-old woman presents with new double vision. On examination she experiences horizontal diplopia on looking to her far right. Covering her left eye only obscures the innermost image. Covering her right eye only obscures the outermost image. In the neutral position her right eye is deviated medially. She has no problem on looking to the far left. Her neurological examination is otherwise normal. What is the most likely problem?,Concomitant right esotropia,Left sided IVth nerve palsy,Left sided VIth nerve palsy,Medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion,Right sided VIth nerve palsy,E,"The VIth nerve is motor to the lateral rectus muscle. It is responsible for abduction of the ipsilateral eye. In the neutral position the affected eye is deviated medially due to unopposed action of the medial rectus. In patients with diplopia the 'cover test' can be used to determine the eye that has the problem. On covering the affected eye the outermost image disappears. After finding a VIth nerve palsy the cause should always be looked for, it is not a diagnosis in itself. Due to the long course and anatomy of the VIth nerve it can be damaged in any condition causing raised intracranial pressure. It can therefore be a 'false localising sign'.  Regarding the options: Concomitant right esotropia is not the answer. An esotropia is a squint where one or both eyes turn inwards. This may alternate between the eyes or may be a problem in just one eye. A concomitant esotropia is a squint where the degree by which the eye turns inwards does not vary in any direction of gaze (as opposed to an incomitant esotropia where the direction of gaze does affect the size or presence of deviation). Concomitant esotropias usually begin early in childhood. The patient has diplopia in all directions of gaze if vision is normal in both eyes. Left sided IVth nerve palsy is not the answer. The IVth nerve controls the superior oblique muscle. Lesions of it typically cause a vertical diplopia, usually noticed on going downstairs or reading. Left sided VIth nerve palsy is not the answer. This would cause a horizontal diplopia but it would be on far left gaze. The outermost image would disappear with the cover test over the left eye if it was affected. A medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion is not the answer. This connects the IIIrd and VIth cranial nerve nuclei in the pons and co-ordinates conjugate horizontal eye movements. Its lesions typically cause internuclear ophthalmoplegia. There will be impaired adduction on the side of the lesion with nystagmus of the contralateral eye. In the neutral position the eyes appear normal. Right VIth nerve palsy is the correct answer (see above)."
urinary system,78,"The parents of an 8-year-old boy have noticed increased blinking and throat clearing. He had normal development and is doing well at school until recently when he was sent home for shouting swear words during assembly. His parents have not noticed any change in behaviour, with normal appetite, sleep and energy. He takes no medication. His father suffers with partial seizures. What is the likely diagnosis?",Epilepsy,Huntington's disease,Rett syndrome,Tourette syndrome,Wilson's disease,D,"Tourette syndrome presents before 18 years of age and many children grow out of it. The criteria for diagnosis require multiple motor and one or more vocal tics, showing themselves over a year, with not more than three consecutive months tic free. The motor tics often have a build up that the patient is aware of, like an itch. Commonly they involve blinking, throat clearing or shoulder shrugging. Although his father has epilepsy this is unlikely to be epilepsy as the shouting of swear words is a typical vocal tic of Tourette's. Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that is autosomal dominant. The features are of choreiform movements, problems with coordination and walking, behavioural and psychiatric problems. The disease leads eventually to dementia and premature death. Rett syndrome predominantly affects females and is a neurodevelopment disorder of the grey matter. The sufferers have small hands and feet with deceleration of head growth. Many patients are epileptic, display repetitive hand movements, rarely develop speech and also have GI problems, such as constipation. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition which causes build up of copper in the body. Copper accumulates in the liver and brain. This results in hepatitis, liver failure or cirrhosis. Accumulation in the brain can result in behavioural changes, depression, seizures, parkinsonism, however the initial sign is usually increased clumsiness."

urinary system,80,"A 75-year-old man presents with 12 months history of cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, intermittent confusion and generalised myoclonus. He was started on 62.5 three times daily of Sinemet. In the following two months he has started experiencing visual hallucinations. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alzheimer's disease,Diffuse Lewy body disease,Multiple system atrophy,Idiopathic Parkinson's disease,Progressive supranuclear palsy,B,"Diffuse Lewy body disease presents with:  Cognitive impairment Visual hallucinations Intermittent confusion Parkinsonism Myoclonus, and Marked sensitivity to neuroleptic treatment.  Visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease treated with L-dopa usually appear late (more than two years after initiation of treatment). Visual hallucinations are not features of multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy."
urinary system,81,A 4 year old boy is having recurrent UTIs and has hesitancy and poor urine stream. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Horseshoe kidney,Vesicoureteric reflux,Polycystic kidney disease,Posterior urethral valve,Poor hygiene,D,Posterior urethral valve is a common cause of urinary tract obstruction. It is due to a fault in embryogenesis. There is a variable degree of severity. It is associated with renal dysplasia which can lead to renal failure. Hydronephrosis and obstructive uropathy can occur and vesicoureteric reflux.
urinary system,82,A 6-month-old boy develops a small right scrotal swelling. Which of the following is true?,An important cause for inguinal hernia in children is muscle weakness,An operation is required for an inguinal hernia,"Hydrocele is more common on the right side, whereas inguinal hernia is more common on the left",Swelling due to a hydrocele should always be surgically corrected,The operation for an inguinal hernia repair in children is inguinal herniorrhaphy,B,"A hydrocele is an accumulation of fluid in the tunica vaginalis. Small hydroceles tend to disappear spontaneously by the age of 1 year. Larger ones may need surgical correction. When the amount of fluid in the hydrocoele varies, this indicates that there is communication with the peritoneal cavity, and these hydroceles need to be treated as indirect inguinal hernias. The treatment for inguinal hernias is called a herniotomy. This is the excision of the hernial sac. A herniorrhaphy is carried out in addition to herniotomy in older patients, and involves the repair of the weak posterior muscle wall. In adults, muscle weakness is an important cause for the development of hernias, however in children they form during embryology. Testes descend into the scrotum during the seventh month of gestation. They are preceded by processus vaginalis - an outpouching of peritoneum. This obliterates before birth, and failure to do so results in inguinal hernia, hydrocele of the cord or hydrocele."
urinary system,83,"A 21-year-old female presented with a sudden onset of left sided head and neck pain. Twenty four hours later she presents with sudden onset of right hemiparesis, facial weakness and homonymous hemianopia and left Horner's syndrome. A CT brain showed a left middle cerebral artery territory infarction. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Antiphospholipid syndrome,Cardiac embolism,Left carotid artery dissection,Migraine,Systemic vasculitis,C,"The two commonest causes of young onset stroke (less than 40 years) are cardioembolism and carotid artery dissection. Seventy-five percent of carotid dissections affect the internal carotid artery (that is, extracranially), and may be related to neck trauma or manipulation, although the cause is often difficult to identify. The classic triad of symptoms of carotid dissection are  unilateral (ipsilateral) headache ipsilateral Horner's syndrome and contralateral hemisphere signs (aphasia, neglect, visual disturbance, hemiparesis).  The Horner's syndrome is caused by compression of the ascending sympathetic supply within the carotid sheath, and results in ptosis and miosis. Anhydrosis is classically not present as the sympathetic supply to the sweat glands is along the external carotid plexus and is therefore spared. Management is aimed at preventing cerebral infarction, and is similar to that of acute stroke. Stenting can be used if there is ongoing ischaemia. Migrainous stroke usually affects the posterior circulation (posterior cerebral artery territory is the commonest). A thrombotic event resulting from cardioembolism or antiphospholipid syndrome would usually only affect intracranial vessels and therefore a Horner's syndrome would be unusual. If the diagnosis were systemic vasculitis you would expect to be told of signs elsewhere."
urinary system,84,A 54-year-old female is admitted with progressive weakness three weeks following a trivial flu-like illness. Which of the following would make Guillain-Barré syndrome an unlikely diagnosis?,Autonomic dysfunction,Elevated protein on CSF examination,Marked muscle wasting,Hyporeflexia,Sensory level below T1,C,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is a neurological disorder causing demyelination and axonal degeneration, with resultant acute, ascending and progressing neuropathy. The majority of patients have had an infection (classically respiratory or gastrointestinal) in the preceding weeks. Classic symptoms are weakness, paraesthesiae and hyporeflexia. The symptoms usually reach a peak 2 weeks following onset, and improve by 5 weeks. Marked muscle wasting is therefore not a usual feature.  Sensory symptoms are variable, and typically include paraesthesia and sensory loss which starts in the lower extremities. Sensory levels are unusual, but the symptoms can present as a pseudo-sensory level (making marked muscle wasting the more correct option in this scenario).  Autonomic dysfunction may also be present, with reduced sweating, poor heat tolerance, paralytic ileus and urinary hesitancy.  Most patients have elevated CSF protein, with normal cell counts, although this may not be present until 1-2 weeks following the onset of symptoms.  Reflexes are typically reduced or absent.  "
urinary system,85,A 31-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department following a witnessed first ever seizure. She is drowsy and confused postictally. A CT brain shows petechial haemorrhages in the right hemisphere. An MRI shows cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Which of the following would be the best initial treatment?,Antibiotics,Aspirin,Heparin,Supportive management,Vitamin K,C,"Venous sinus thrombosis is more common in young women and it may present with headaches or symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. It can also cause seizures. The underlying problem is a thrombosis and the petechial haemorrhages are caused by venous outflow blockage. It is therefore important that anticoagulation is started immediately to relieve the cause. Heparin is the most appropriate anticoagulant to use in this circumstance. Antibiotics are not the best answer. The underlying cause may be infection and it would be important to look for this and treat it. However, there is no sign of this in this case. It would be most important here to get on and treat the thrombosis. Aspirin is not the best answer. Since the clot is venous, heparin is more appropriate. Supportive management is not the best answer. The underlying thrombosis should be treated to relieve symptoms. The petechial haemorrhages should not put you off anticoagulating the patient. Vitamin K can sometimes be used to treat coagulopathies in deficient patients; however that is not applicable here. The underlying problem is a clot which should be treated. The haemorrhages are secondary to the venous outflow blockage."
urinary system,86,A 32-year-old woman is assessed at the antenatal clinic; she had no known medical disease prior to this pregnancy. Which of the following scenarios is most compatible with chronic hypertension in pregnancy?,Blood pressure 135/92 mmHg at 28 weeks of gestation,Blood pressure 142/90 mmHg at 12 weeks of gestation,Development of pre-eclampsia at 32 weeks,Development of pre-eclampsia at 35 weeks,Documentation of proteinuria +++ by urine dipstick at 35 weeks of gestation,B,"Chronic hypertension in pregnancy is defined as blood pressure of at least 140 mmHg systolic or 90 mmHg diastolic before pregnancy, or for women who first present for care during pregnancy as in this case, before 20 weeks of gestation. Proteinuria at the third trimester, if not present initially, favours the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, instead of end-organ damage of chronic hypertension. Women with chronic hypertension have an increased chance of pre-eclampsia and therefore pre-eclampsia per se does not exclude concurrent chronic hypertension. In fact, the condition of pre-eclampsia tends to develop at less than 34 weeks of gestation with chronic hypertension, earlier than is typical in women without antecedent hypertension. Most women with chronic hypertension have a decrease in blood pressure during pregnancy. Their blood pressure falls toward the end of the first trimester. Still, chronic hypertension has to be diagnosed by first documentation of high blood pressure before 20 weeks of gestation."
urinary system,87,"A 70-year-old man is admitted to hospital complaining of a twelve-day history of loin pain, fevers and occasional rigors. On examination, his temperature is 37.9°C. The renal function is normal. Urinalysis of a mid stream urine shows:    White cell count greater than100/mm^3   Red cell count greater than50/mm^3    No organisms seen, with no growth. Which would be your first investigation of choice?",CT abdomen and pelvis,Intravenous urogram (IVU),Prostatic specific antigen (PSA) measurement,Transthoracic echocardiogram,Ultrasound scan renal tract,E,"Renal cell carcinomas may present in a variety of ways, with only a minority being diagnosed with the classical triad of:  Haematuria Loin pain A palpable mass.  Relatively common presentations include:  Anaemia Hypertension Pyrexia of unknown origin Fatigue Increased plasma viscosity.  Less common presentations include:  Hypercalcaemia Polycythaemia Liver dysfunction Enteropathy Myopathy.  Urinalysis may show sterile pyuria, as here. Other causes of sterile pyuria are:  Partially treated urinary tract infections  Tuberculosis of the renal tract Urethritis and sexually transmitted diseases Acute glomerulonephritis Tubulo-interstitial diseases Adult polycystic kidney disease Renal stones.  Ultrasound scan of the renal tract would be the first investigation of choice, as it is able to pick up 95% of renal cell carcinomas greater than 1 cm in diameter. It would also exclude infective or inflammatory collections within the renal tract. If required, a computerised tomography (CT) +/- guided biopsy could be obtained to prove the diagnosis. An intravenous urogram (IVU) was considered the investigation of choice before the advent of ultrasound. A chest x ray and bone scan would be required to complete the basic investigations."
urinary system,88,"You are called to see a man in the Emergency department who has been in a road traffic accident. His memory of events is poor but he thinks he banged his head. His main complaint now is of extreme pain in his right eye. On examination he has reduced visual acuity (counting fingers only), proptosis and complete ophthalmoplegia of his right eye. You notice that the eye is injected, chemotic and on closer inspection appears to be pulsating. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute glaucoma,Blow-out fracture,Caroticocavernous fistula,Cavernous sinus thrombosis,Retinal haemorrhage,C,"Caroticocavernous fistula is the correct answer. It is a high pressure shunt of blood between the intracavernous carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. It is usually traumatic and may occur secondary to open or closed head trauma. Patients usually complain of pain in the eye. The most striking sign is pulsatile proptosis. Patients also have palsies of the IIIrd, IVth and Vth nerve palsies, injection and chemosis due to raised episcleral venous pressure. Those who know to listen for it will also hear an orbital bruit. Acute glaucoma is incorrect. It causes visual loss and a painful red eye but does not usually follow trauma. It is not associated with ophthalmoplegia, proptosis or visible pulsations. A blow-out fracture is a fracture of the walls or floor of the orbit. It may cause diplopia in upgaze due to trapping of the eye muscles but would not typically cause the other symptoms. Cavernous sinus thrombosis may produce ophthalmoplegia and proptosis, but does not usually follow trauma and would not cause the pulsations. Retinal haemorrhage causes painless visual loss but would not cause the other symptoms."
urinary system,89,"A 25-year-old woman presents with urinary frequency, dysuria and fever. Urine microscopy shows 20-50 RBC and 10-20 WBC in each field. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Schistosmiasis,Kidney trauma,Ureteric calculus,Bladder calculi,Cystitis,E,Hematuria and significant WBC in urine (>10 per HPF) makes cystitis the most likely diagnosis
urinary system,90,A 30-year-old woman receives a cadaveric renal transplantation after having had chronic end-stage renal failure. Of note in her medical history is that she has a neuropathic bladder for which she performs intermittent self-catheterisation. Six months after transplantation she presents with acute pain in the region of the transplanted kidney. Which one of the following is the most likely reason for the pain?,Acute retention of urine,Allograft rejection,Pyelonephritis,Renal calculi,Renal infarction,C,"Acute urinary retention would not commonly cause pain overlying a transplanted kidney, and as this lady self-catheterises, it would be an unlikely occurrence. Due to the elapsed time between the transplant and this episode, allograft rejection can be discounted. This is because chronic rejection (more than three months post transplant) is a painless process, with difficult to control hypertension, proteinuria and slowly rising serum creatinine. Accelerated rejection (one to five days post transplant) can present with fever, an acutely tender swollen graft, and rapidly rising serum creatinine. Acute rejection (five days to three months) is clinically silent in the majority, but can present with a swollen, tender kidney. Both of these can be discounted as it has been 6 months since the patient's transplant. Renal infarction can also be discounted. This can be a surgical complication of renal transplantation, but it presents early with a calyceal fistula and urinary leak. Renal stones could cause acute pain in the region of a transplanted kidney, but would be less likely in this patient than infection. The answer in this case is acute pyelonephritis. This patient is in the intermediate stage of the post-transplantation immunosuppression, when the patient is most immunocompromised (three to six months post-transplant). She is at high risk of an acute episode of pyelonephritis in the transplanted kidney, due to the immunosuppression, the neuropathic bladder and self-catheterisation. This would present like an acute rejection episode, with a tender swollen graft, low-grade pyrexia, and deteriorating graft function. This would be commonly associated with septicaemia in this patient, and requires parenteral antibiotics. If this lady were to be managed as a transplant rejection, with high dose intravenous steroids, the result could be catastrophic."
urinary system,91,"A patient is found to have hypokalaemia, hypercholaraemic acidosis and a urinary pH of 6.0. What type of renal tubular acidosis does this indicate?",Does not indicate renal tubular acidosis,Type 1,Type 4,Type 2,Type 3,D,"Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is an inability to form acid urine in the distal tubule. It can be secondary to autoimmune diseases. There is hypokalaemia, hypercholaraemic metabolic acidosis, urinary pH of above 6 and hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuria can lead to renal stone formation. In type 2 there is defective secretion of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Hypokalaemia and hyperchloraemic acidosis is observed but the pH can be less than 6 and hypercalciuria is not a feature. In type 4 there is reduced aldosterone and causes include Addisons, diabetes, SLE and amyloidosis. There is hyperkalaemia differentiating it from the other types and urinary pH is normally low. There is as with the other types hypercholaraemic metabolic acidosis. Type 3 no longer exists and is thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2."
urinary system,92,A 2-year-old boy presented with gradual swelling of feet and poor feeding. He has gained weight and has dark urine. What is the single most appropriate investigation?,Serum albumin,24h urinary protein,Serum calcium,BUE,Serum glucose,B,A case of nephritic syndrome. So the single most appropriate investigation from the given options is 24 hour urinary protein
urinary system,93,In which of the following circumstances would the treatment of anaemia with erythropoetin still be expected to be effective?,Aluminium toxicity,Folate deficiency,Hyperkalaemia,Infection,Iron deficiency,C,"Epoetin (recombinant human erythropoeitin) is used:  in chronic renal failure to shorten the period of anaemia in those receiving platinum-based chemotherapy, and prevention of anaemia in premature babies with low birth weight.  Its efficacy may be impaired in certain circumstances particularly with iron deficiency but also with aluminium toxicity, folate deficiency and infection. In the latter, the switch to the acute phase proteins impairs its function. Its efficacy is unimpaired in hyperkalaemia."
urinary system,94,"You perform a renal function test on a 25-year-old man and an 83-year-old lady. Both of them have a creatinine level of 90 mmol/L. You note, however, that the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) for the young man is 95 ml/min/1.73m^2 and that the eGFR for the elderly lady is 55 ml/min/1.73m^2. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?",Age-related change to the medullary vasculature,Age-related muscle loss in the elderly lady,Increased glomerular filtration rate in the young man,Increased bone mass in the young man,Reduced blood flow in the afferent arterioles of the cortex in the elderly lady,B,"Age-related muscle loss in the elderly lady is correct because there is a decline in glomerular filtration rate and plasma flow rate associated with age. The creatinine level in the plasma does not increase because there is age-related muscle loss. A 'normal' creatinine in an elderly patient is thus not indicative of normal renal function and is a poor marker to establish whether an elderly patient has renal impairment. It is much more accurate to use estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Age-related change to the medullary vasculature is incorrect because there is no change to medullary vasculature associated with ageing. Increased glomerular filtration rate in the young man is incorrect because this man has a normal glomerular filtration rate. Increased bone mass in the young man is incorrect because bone has no implication on renal function and the creatinines are the same. Reduced blood flow in the afferent arterioles of the cortex in the elderly lady should not be selected because, although there is reduced blood flow in the afferent arterioles of the cortex associated with ageing, this would not explain the relatively 'normal' level of creatinine in the elderly lady.

urinary system,95,"A 39-year-old painter presents with a burning pain in both feet, which has deteriorated over the last six months. He drinks 60 units of alcohol weekly and has a family history of pernicious anaemia. On examination he has impairment of all modalities of sensation in both feet but particularly pain, temperature and absent ankle jerks. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcoholic peripheral neuropathy,Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy,Hereditary sensory neuropathy,Lead neuropathy,Vitamin B12 deficiency,A,"Alcohol abuse and diabetes are the commonest causes of peripheral neuropathy in the United Kingdom. Vitamin B12 deficiency most commonly involves the peripheral nerves, but can also result in subacute degeneration of the spinal cord. Peripheral involvement results in loss of vibration sense and proprioception. Cord involvement then affects the posterior columns and corticospinal tracts resulting in loss of reflexes, weakness, spasiticity, Babinski's responses and ataxia. The spinothalamic columns are not classically affected. Peripheral involvement results in loss of vibration sense and proprioception. Cord involvement then affects the posterior columns and corticospinal tracts resulting in loss of reflexes, weakness, spasiticity, Babinski's responses and ataxia. Lead neuropathy is purely motor affecting mainly the upper limbs. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculopathy causes mainly motor impairment (distal and proximal)."
urinary system,96,"A 43-year-old gentleman has been brought to the Emergency department by his partner. He was diagnosed with HIV infection 10 years ago and his CD4 count has been maintained on triple therapy. He has recently been dismissed from work for poor performance. He has lost interest in cooking and socialising over the past 10 months. There has been a slurring in his speech. His partner feels he has been more aggressive and withdrawn, however in the past few days he has started to have hallucinations. What is the likely diagnosis?",Cryptococcal meningitis,HIV dementia,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,Schizophrenia,Toxoplasmosis,B,"HIV infection can cause dementia that progresses over a longer time period than progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Symptoms include:  Confusion Depression Reduced concentration Behavioural changes Psychosis Speech and balance problems, and Muscle weakness.  Patients with cryptococcal meningitis present with headache, fever, vomiting and few neurological signs. PML can present at any CD4 count with ataxia, behavioural changes and focal neurological signs, often progressing over a period of months to paresis or even coma. Toxoplasmosis presents with headache, fever and seizures. It has a typical CT head scan with ring enhancing lesions. This patient's symptoms may be compatible with schizophrenia, however given his HIV status and neurology HIV dementia is more likely."

urinary system,98,What is the most common finding in Cheyne-Stokes breathing?,Heart failure,Liver failure,Pilocytic astrocytoma,Renal failure,Stroke,A,Two-thirds of cases of Cheyne-Stokes breathing appear to have heart failure. Treatment of this can result in improvement of the breathing disorder. Stroke and metabolic dysfunction can also result in Cheyne-Stokes apnoea but are not as common as heart failure. Cheyne-Stokes is a type of central sleep apnoea in which there is loss of chest and abdominal movements and crescendo-decrescendo breathing in a repetitive fashion. Treatments include diuretics and non-invasive ventilation. It is seen in end of life care but also during sleep apneoa.

urinary system,100,"A 48-year old alcoholic man presents with gradually increasing confusion and drowsiness over the past two weeks. He had previously attended the Emergency department having fallen over drunk, but had discharged himself before being reviewed by a doctor. On examination he has multiple old bruises including one to his right arm and to the right side of his face above his eye. His BP is 150/82 mmHg, his pulse is 67 and irregular. There is 3/5 power weakness of his left arm, he is drowsy and confused. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 12.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 121 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 133 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 µmol/L (79-118)   ALT 190 U/L (5-40)    Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?",CT head,IV broad spectrum antibiotics,Lumbar puncture,Ultrasound abdomen,Upper GI endoscopy,A,"The suspicion is that this patient has a subdural haematoma. In patients with alcoholism who are more likely to have abnormal clotting, what seems like a very minor, innocuous injury may lead to a potentially serious bleed. CT head is the initial investigation of choice. Whilst sepsis is possible, we have no indication on initial findings of a source of infection, therefore antibiotics are not appropriate. A lumbar puncture should also be avoided until after CT head. An ultrasound, whilst it would confirm liver changes, is unlikely to be helpful in the acute stage, and the anaemia is likely to be chronic, rather than due to an acute bleed."
urinary system,101,"A 30-year-old woman presents to the emergency room after an episode of transient left sided weakness lasting 30 minutes. She reports that she was driving at the time and describes a white zigzag before developing a headache. She then describes a descending numbness and weakness on the left-side of her body. She stopped the car and called an ambulance. On arrival at the hospital her blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg, pulse was regular at 90 beats per minute. She is alert and orientated. She follows commands, has full strength in her limbs and symmetric reflexes and normal tone. Her cranial nerves are intact and fundoscopy is unremarkable. Visual fields are full on direct confrontation and the eye movements are intact. There is a family history of stroke in her mother, and her sister has migraines. Her past medical history is notable for migraines and hyperthyroidism. What is the most likely explanation?",Cerebrovascular accident,Complicated migraine,Confusion migraine,Migraine without aura,Transient ischemic attack,B,A complicated migraine is one which results in hemi sensory or hemi motor findings associated with a typical migraine presentation. It is asubclassification of migraine with aura A confusional migraine involves alteration in sensorium rather than limb involvement. A transient ischemic attack is a possibility however given the history of migraines and age the most likely diagnosis is complicated migraine. The presentation does not fit for a stroke. A migraine with aura can present wqith unilateral weakness as an atypical aura.    
urinary system,102,Metformin if utilised in renal impairment can lead to which of the following?,Worsening renal failure,Proteinuria,Hypertension,Liver disease,Lactic acidosis,E,Metformin when utilised in renal impairment or liver disease can lead to lactic acidosis. This is due to the fact that metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis which utilises lactate.
urinary system,103,"A 9 year old presents unwell with a mild fever. He had a cold in the preceding few days and has now developed a purpuric rash on his buttocks and legs. He is also complaining of joint pain. A urinalysis reveals haematuria and proteinuria and bloods reveal acute renal failure and eosinophilia. What is the likely pathological basis of the renal disease, given the likely diagnosis?",Glomerular IgA deposition and mesangial proliferation,Glomerular complement deposition and mesangial proliferation,Glomerular IgG deposition and mesangial proliferation,Glomerulo sclerosis,Loss of podocytes,A,"The clinical features, characteristic purpuric rash and the investigation reveal the most likely diagnosis is Henoch Schonlein purpura. It is a small vessel vasculitis and in the kidneys leads to IgA deposition and mesangial proliferation similar to IgA nephropathy. IgA nephropathy however is not associated with the other clinical features observed here."
urinary system,104,A 78-year-old woman presents with a six month history of episodes of giddiness and impaired consciousness. Neurological examination is normal. What is the most likely cause?,Alzheimer-type dementia,Chronic subdural haematoma,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Depressive stupor,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,B,"Chronic subdural haematoma is a common manifestation of intermittent confusion or focal neurological deficit in the elderly population. It may mimic a stroke. Alzheimer's dementia is usually associated with a slowly progressive cognitive impairment.

urinary system,105,"A 47-year-old patient with diabetes is referred from the Emergency department complaining of dizziness and vomiting. On examination he is alert and orientated, his pulse is 80 irregularly irregular and BP 160/90 mmHg. There is nystagmus on left lateral gaze and his speech is slurred. On examination of the limbs you note intention tremor and past pointing. He is ataxic when mobilised. What is the likely diagnosis?",Brainstem infarction,Cerebellar CVA,Sub-acute combined degeneration of the cord,Viral labyrinthitis,Wernicke’s encephalopathy,B,"This man has a history of vertigo and the clinical signs of nystagmus. Slurred speech, intention tremor and past pointing, as well as ataxia, suggest the cerebellum as the site of injury. This man also has risk factors for cerebrovascular disease including atrial fibrillation and hypertension. Labyrinthitis would not produce cerebellar signs despite being associated with nystagmus. In Wernicke's encephalopathy, you would expect confusion with ophthalmoplegia and ataxia. Sub-acute combined degeneration of the cord is associated with posterior column signs, loss of vibration sensation and a positive Romberg's test. Brainstem signs would be expected with a brainstem CVA and impaired conscious level."
urinary system,106,A 35-year-old man has wrist drop of his right hand. Examination reveals a small area of sensory loss on the dorsum of the hand. Which of the following nerves is likely to be involved?,Long thoracic nerve,Median nerve,Radial nerve,T1 nerve root,Ulnar nerve,C,"The radial nerve supplies brachioradialis, extensor carpi radialis longus and the extensor muscles of the forearm (the latter is via the posteior interosseus nerve). The sensory branches supply the dorsum of the thumb, and the dorsum of the fingers up to the proximal interphalangeal joint (PIPJ) and the middle of the ring finger. The extent of loss of muscle power depends on the level of the nerve damage, but the typical posture is a wrist drop with hand pronation and thumb adduction. Sensation is impaired in the area described above. The long thoracic nerve supplies serratus anterior, and damage results in winging of the scapula. A median nerve palsy results in a lack of ability to abduct and oppose the thumb, weakness in forearm pronation and finger flexion and sensory loss in the thumb, index finder and radial aspect of the ring finger. A T1 nerve root lesion results in Klumpke's palsy - loss of finger flexion and abduction and adduction with reduced sensation over the medial upper limb. The ulnar nerve is most often compressed at the elbow, which results in numbness in the 5th finger, the medial aspect of the ring finger and the dorsum of the hand over the 5th finger. There is weakness of the small muscles of the hand and, if allowed to progress, a claw hand develops where the little and ring fingers curl into the palm. "
urinary system,107,Which of the following should be utilised in the prevention of tumour lysis syndrome?,NSAIDs,IV hydration,IV hydration and hypouricaemic agents,Calcium gluconate,Furosemide,C,"Tumour lysis syndrome is secondary to rapid breakdown of tumour cell (typically haematological malignancies) which leads to hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia and acute renal failure. If risk of tumour lysis syndrome is high then IV hydration and hypouricaemic agents such as allopurinol or newer rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) should be utilised. Urinary alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate has also been used."

Therefore she has a 50% chance of having the disease as she needs only to inherit one mutant gene, from her father. The features are of choreiform movements, psychiatric illness and eventually dementia."
urinary system,109,An 80-year-old gentleman attends the Emergency department with a stroke affecting his left arm and leg. He has had radiotherapy to the neck and there is a lot of scarring present. Carotid scanning shows 70% stenosis on the right side. Which statement is correct?,Carotid endarterectomy is contraindicated,Carotid stenting is contraindicated,Carotid stenting is associated with lower rates of stroke than surgery,Carotid stenting is proven to be safer than carotid endarterectomy,Carotid stenting should be performed,E,"There is an indication for intervention in this patient. Carotid endarterectomy has been established as an effective treatment for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients who are shown to have carotid artery stenosis. It reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death by 48% in a person with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis (greater than70%) who has had a TIA. The peri-operative risk of disabling stroke or death is approximately 3%. Current UK guidelines recommend endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis, based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial which showed clear benefit. The endarterectomy should be performed as soon as the patient is fit for surgery, preferably within two weeks of a TIA. The benefit is marginal for symptomatic patients with 50-69% stenosis, but may be greater in male patients. NICE recommends these patients are also considered for endarterectomy. There is significantly less benefit for asymptomatic patients, even those with greater than 60% stenosis. Patients with less than 50% stenosis should not be considered for carotid surgery. Recurrent stenosis can occur in 1-20% of patients following endarterectomy, and re-operation is needed in 1-3% of cases. Ipsilateral strokes occur in 9% of patients following endarterectomy, and 26% of those treated with medical management alone (within 2 years). All patients with suspected non-disabling stroke or TIA who are considered as candidates for carotid endarterectomy should have carotid imaging within 1 week. Carotid endarterectomy is also indicated following a non-disabling stroke. However, if the patient has had a disabling stroke there is no real benefit in them undergoing the procedure. Carotid stenting is increasingly being used as an alternative to endarterectomy. This is a less invasive revascularisation strategy, and uses an embolic protection device. There seems to be a similar early risk of death or stroke, and similar long-term benefits. Risk is higher in elderly patients, possibly due to vascular tortuosity and calcification. The procedure is currently indicated in selected cases, such as restenosis. In this situation previous radiotherapy may make endarterectomy difficult, and stenting may be preferred. Please note for this explanation we have used the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterecomy Trial (NASCET) criteria, as opposed to the European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group (ECST) criteria. See NICE guidelines for the difference - carotid imaging reports will state which criteria are being used. "
urinary system,110,Chronic subdural haematoma in a 75-year-old man is not associated with the presence of which of the following?,Bilateral papilloedema,Hemiparesis,Fluctuating level of consciousness,Impaired cognitive function,Internuclear ophthalmoplegia,E,"The most common presenting symptom of chronic subdural haematoma (SDH) is headache, which is seen in up to 80% of patients. Other common symptoms are:  fatigue memory impairment confusion nausea and vomiting impaired vision, and seizures.  Hemiparesis, or paralysis is also possible. Patients with large haematomas may develop fluctuating levels or consciousness, or coma. Although it is a late sign, bilateral papilloedema may occur with raised intracranial pressure. Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia is associated with multiple sclerosis and unilateral lesions of medial longitudinal fasciculus and may occur with small brain stem infarcts. It is not a presenting feature of chronic subdural haematoma."
urinary system,111,A 23-year-old female presents at 16 weeks into her first pregnancy with a blood pressure of 144/96 mmHg. A 24-hour urine collection reveals a protein excretion of 0.7 g/day (less than0.2). Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?,Essential hypertension,Gestational hypertension,Normal changes of pregnancy,Pre-eclampsia,Secondary hypertension,E,"This pregnant woman has hypertension and proteinuria (as defined by a blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg and proteinuria above 0.3 g/day). It would not be regarded as normal to have this high a blood pressure or protein content of urine. Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy occur in women with pre-existing primary or secondary hypertension, and in women who develop new-onset hypertension (defined as those cases occurring after 20 weeks). All patients who have hypertension during pregnancy are at increased risk of eclampsia. Although the rate of this is decreasing, hypertension in pregnancy remains one of the leading causes of maternal death. In addition, it can lead to stillbirth, preterm birth, and small for gestational age babies. In pregnancy, chronic hypertension is defined as hypertension that is present at the booking visit or before 20 weeks, or if the woman is already taking antihypertensive medication when she conceives. It can be primary or secondary in aetiology. Gestational hypertension is new hypertension which presents after 20 weeks without significant proteinuria. Pre-eclampsia is new hypertension presenting after 20 weeks with significant proteinuria. Severe pre-eclampsia is pre-eclampsia with severe hypertension (greater than160/110 mmHg) and/or with symptoms (headache, visual disturbance, abdominal pain, vomiting, breathlessness, and oedema), and/or biochemical and haematological impairment. The presence of significant proteinuria in chronic hypertension should alert you to the suspect underlying renal disease, especially in a young patient. Significant proteinuria is defined as a urinary protein:creatinine ratio greater than 30 mg/mmol or a 24-hour urine collection or more than 300 mg protein. In pregnancy, it only indicates pre-eclampsia if it develops after 20 weeks gestation. Management of chronic hypertension in pregnancy involves determining the cause (if you suspect it to be secondary), restricting dietary sodium, regular antenatal check-ups, and anti-hypertensive treatment. Blood pressure should be kept less than 150/100 mmHg, unless there is evidence of target-organ damage in which case the blood pressure should be kept less than 140/90 mmHg. Patients with chronic hypertension are at increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia and are therefore prescribed 75 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks, which is believed to reduce the risk. ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor blockers are avoided due to their increased risk of congenital malformations. In general, treatment should be overseen by an obstetrician if there is primary hypertension, and a renal physician or endocrinologist if secondary hypertension is suspected. "
urinary system,112,A 65-year-old lady is evaluated for shortness of breath. The attending clinician is concerned about a pulmonary embolism and proceeds with a CT pulmonary angiogram. The radiologist is concerned about the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy as the patient has some degree of existing renal impairment. At what time period does contrast-induced nephropathy classically peak?,4-8 hours,48-72 hours,5-7 days,14 days,28 days,B,Studies have shown that contrast-induced nephropathy is most likely to occur 48 to 72 hours after the administration of intravenous contrast hence option C is the best answer. The other time periods stated are less likely and are therefore incorrect. 
urinary system,113,"You are asked to see a haemodialysis patient who developed high fever one hour after initiation of dialysis. Her dialysis was performed using a tunnelled right internal jugular vein catheter, which has been in place and functioning for one year. No other vascular access has been created. The current catheter exit site looked clean. Examination showed no cardiac murmur. Blood cultures were drawn from the catheter and her peripheral arm; both grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Which ONE of the following best describes the correct treatment approach?",Administer vancomycin,Administer vancomycin and gentamicin,Administer vancomycin and remove the central venous catheter,"Administer vancomycin, keep the central venous catheter but add concomitant antibiotic lock (making use of supratherapeutic concentrations of vancomycin within the catheter lumen after each dialysis session)",Discharge the patient with oral flucloxacillin,C,"Catheter removal is strongly recommended in Staphylococcus aureus bloodstream infection given the high risk of recurrence in these patients. Flucloxacillin should not be used in MRSA infection; vancomycin is the drug of choice. Daptomycin might be needed if the minimum inhibitory concentration is ≥2 μg/ml indicative of heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate S. aureus (hVISA). Catheter removal is also recommended in non-staphylococcus aureus catheter-related bloodstream infection in the following circumstances:  Severe sepsis Haemodynamic instability Endocarditis Evidence of metastatic infection, or Persistence of bacteraemia after 48-72 hours of effective antibiotics.  Antibiotic lock therapy involves instillation of high-dose antibiotics (prepared using heparin) at the end of each dialysis session into the catheter to maintain high concentrations within the dialysis catheter. The reported success rate to salvage a tunnelled catheter using a combination of systemic antimicrobials and antibiotic lock therapy is only 40% to 55% with S. aureus (compared with 75% to 84% with coagulase negative Staphylococci)."
urinary system,114,"A 22-year-old woman presents with right loin pain, oliguria and coke-coloured urine. Blood pressure is increased at 160/70 mmHg and urinary dipstick shows protein ++++ and blood ++++. Microscopy is awaited. Blood tests reveal:    Hb 126 g/L (115 - 165)   WCC 8.4 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelets 412 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Na 137 mmol/L (137 - 144)   K 5.7 mmol/L (3.5 - 4.9)   Creatinine 263 μmol/L (60 - 110)   Urea 25.2 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.5)    What is the most appropriate next investigation of this patient?",DMSA scan,Plain abdominal KUB,Renal angiography,Renal biopsy,Renal ultrasound scan,E,"Although this patient has features of nephritic syndrome and may warrant biopsy in the future, a renal ultrasound scan is the best next investigation. Renal ultrasound allows one to assess kidney size, the presence of hydronephrosis, cysts or tumours and any developmental abnormalities. Doppler traces also allow renal blood flow to be assessed. If a clear identifiable precipitant is identified as the cause of the acute kidney injury an ultrasound may not be appropriate. If a patient is in acute urinary retention and their creatinine falls spontaneously with the insertion of a catheter, they do not necessarily need an ultrasound. If a patient has had an insult such as profound hypotension or has AKI in the context of sepsis with a previously normal creatinine, an ultrasound will not add much to the diagnosis unless they fail to recover with time. However, the above patient warrants ultrasound imaging.  A DMSA scan is not indicated for this patient. A plain abdominal KUB is less frequently used compared to a CT KUB for stone disease, however, this patient has nephritis. Angiography is not indicated for this patient. A renal biopsy may be indicated in the future, but an ultrasound should be performed first.  A renal ultrasound scan should be performed in all patients with acute kidney injury, unless a clear treatable cause is identified."
urinary system,115,"A 66-year-old male presents with a sudden onset of ataxia, vomiting and headache, followed by increasing drowsiness. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cerebellar haemorrhage,Acute subdural haemorrhage,Frontal subdural empyema,Herpes simplex encephalitis,Pituitary apoplexy,A,"Acute cerebellar infarct or haemorrhage is associated with acute onset of ataxia, headache and vomiting and eventually drowsiness and coma due to the development of obstructing hydrocephalus. Early computerised tomography (CT) brain scan and close observation are essential in the management of acute cerebellar haemorrhage."
urinary system,116,An elderly man was hospitalised because of viral encephalitis for which he received aciclovir intravenously. There was a decline in the urine output five days later. A nephrologist in consultation suggested aciclovir-induced acute kidney injury. Which of the following characteristics are compatible with the diagnosis?,Renal ultrasound is expected to show hydronephrosis,The mechanism is tubular obstruction,The patient should be asymptomatic apart from decrease in the urine output,The urine microscopy does not add information,This patient's renal function typically begins to deteriorate three weeks after aciclovir therapy,B,"Intravenous doses of aciclovir, which has a relatively low solubility, can lead to deposition of aciclovir crystals in the renal tubules, resulting in intratubular obstruction and foci of interstitial inflammation. This occurs more often in a dehydrated patient. The decline in renal function is expected to begin shortly after aciclovir therapy, rather than three weeks after therapy. No hydronephrosis is seen because the obstruction is intratubular (and not ureteral). However, the patient will complain of flank or abdominal pain (presumably due to urinary tract obstruction). In some cases, birefringent needle-shaped aciclovir crystals can be seen in the patient's urine (particularly under polarised light), so the urine microscopy may indeed add information. This condition can be prevented by prior hydration and slow drug infusion."
urinary system,117,"A 15-year-old boy presents with testicular pain for 2days. There is no history of trauma. Examination: temp=38.5C, right hemi-scrotum tenderness. What is the single most appropriate management?",Give antibiotics,Give analgesia,Reassure,US scrotum,Exploratory surgery,A,This is a case of epididymoorchitis. Testicular pain with fever without history of trauma points towards the diagnosis of epididymoorchitis
urinary system,118,"An 85-year-old woman presents to the medical intake with oliguria and dark urine following a mechanical fall and a long-lie of 20 hours. She has acute kidney injury with a glomerular filtration rate of 32 ml/min/1.73m^3 and creatine kinase is raised at 25,000 (normal range 25-195 iu/l). You commence initial therapy and prescribe her regular medications. Which of her medications is it most important to stop in these circumstances?",Aspirin 75 mg PO OD,Oral calcium supplements,Paracetamol 1 g PO QDS,Salbutamol inhaler PRN,Simvastatin 40 mg PO ON,E,"Initial management is that of rehydration and correction of electrolyte disturbances. The biochemical features of rhabdomyolysis are raised creatine kinase, hypocalcaemia, hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury. Administration of bicarbonate in cases where the urine pH is less than 6.5 despite fluid repletion has been advocated. Statins should be avoided in patients with rhabdomyolysis due to myotoxicity. In those taking statins the risk of sporadic rhabdomyolysis is 0.44 per 10,000 patients per year. Relatively safe in these circumstances are:  asprin oral calcium paracetamol, and inhaled salbutamol.  Statins are myotoxic and can cause rhabdomyolysis independent from trauma. They should be stopped in any patient presenting with the syndrome."
urinary system,119,Which of the following is true of the anticonvulsant levetiracetam?,Acts via the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor,Is associated with increased plasma concentrations of sodium valproate,Is associated with induction of hepatic cytochrome p450 enzymes,Is used as monotherapy for the treatment of generalised convulsions,Is well absorbed via the oral route,E,"Levetiracetam (Keppra) is an adjunctive treatment for partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. Its mechanism of action is unknown. It is rapidly absorbed orally, it does not affect hepatic enzymes but dose reduction is required in renal failure. The drug appears to be well tolerated with few side effects. Keppra works hrough binding to the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A in the brainand modulating neurotransmitter release.  It does not induce cytochrome p450 like other anti-epileptics."
urinary system,120,"A 77-year-old male presents with sudden loss of vision in his right eye, associated with a relative afferent pupillary defect. He has poorly controlled systemic hypertension and raised cholesterol. What is the most likely aetiology of his presentation?",Cataract,Chronic open angle glaucoma,Macular degeneration,Retinal vascular occlusion,Retinitis pigmentosa,D,"A tricky question. You may not know the answer, so look at this another way.  There are many vascular risk factors here and that information is key. Look at the options and consider which one may be most likely given the presence of these risk factors. Secondly, there is a sudden loss of vision. This is important. All of the others cause a more chronic visual loss.  We've deliberately framed this question like this to help you to work your way through the answer even when you may not immediately know which answer is correct. You can't possibly know the answer to all of the questions that will be posed in your actual AKT exam (but well done if you do!), however using this method, it will help you to narrow down your options and improve your hit rate on those that you don't. So if you don't immediately know the answer, don't panic. Look at the information given and try to think about the most likely answer.

urinary system,121,"A 63-year-old man presents with a three month history of tremor affecting his left arm. In his past medical history he had suffered from a depressive psychosis for 10 years for which he had received intermittent chlorpromazine and amitriptyline but had had not taken any therapy for the last four months. He describes that his two brothers also had tremors. On examination he had a resting tremor of his left hand, with cogwheel rigidity of that arm and he had a mild generalised bradykinesia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benign essential tremor ,Drug-induced parkinsonism,Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease,Multiple system atrophy ,Wilson’s disease,C,"Due to the fact that the symptoms and signs are present only on the left side the most likely diagnosis is idiopathic Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder which selectively affects dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, cultimating in their destruction. After approximately 50% of the dopamine neurones, and 75-80% of striatal dopamine is lost patients start to exhibit the classical signs of bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity. These signs are often unilateral initially. Despite many years of research, the cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors still remains unclear. Neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism is usually bilateral and symmetrical. Essential tremor does not cause rest tremor (it usually causes bilateral postural and action tremor). It is unusal for Wilson's disease to present this late in life. Multi-system atrophy is characterised by Parkinsonian features, cerebellar ataxia and autonomin dysfunction."
urinary system,122,A patient who was recently admitted to the medical receiving unit with general malaise has been found to have deranged renal function. Your registrar asks you to arrange 'an urgent scan' to exclude obstruction of the kidneys. Which of the following is most appropriate?,"CT KUB (kidneys, ureters and bladder)",MR angiography of renal tract,MRI kidneys,Plain abdominal x ray,Ultrasound renal tract,E,"Acute imaging of the kidneys is intended primarily to exclude obstructive uropathy, which would be demonstrated on ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound imaging is a safe, non-invasive means rapidly to exclude a correctable cause of renal impairment. It is readily available in most hospitals and can be performed by a sonographer or radiologist. A CT KUB is indicated when the USS (and clinical history) is suggestive of the presence of renal calculi, whether or not they are causing obstruction. MR imaging of the kidneys can help determine the nature of a lesion seen on ultrasound imaging. It is expensive, time-consuming, and not available in all locations. Furthermore many patients with magnetic materials inserted, for example, pacemakers, defibrillators are precluded from entering the strong magnetic field. These factors preclude its use as a first-line approach to excluding acute obstruction of the kidney. MR angiography is helpful to exclude renal artery stenosis. This will not confirm or refute the presence of post-renal obstruction. A plain abdominal x ray will occasionally demonstrate the presence of radio-opaque renal calculi, but cannot confirm or refute the presence of post-renal obstruction. It should not be done routinely in all patients with acute renal impairment unless there is a strong clinical suspicion of renal calculi (in which case most patients will proceed to having a CT KUB examination)."
urinary system,123,Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) plays a crucial homeosatic role in osmoregulation. From where is antidiuretic hormone released?,Adrenal medulla,Anterior pituitary,Hypothalamus,Posterior pituitary,Right atrium,D,Antidiuretic hormone is synthesised in the hypothalamus and stored and released from the posterior pituitary. The other locations described are incorrect and the other options should not be selected. The Adrenals secreted steroid hormones as well as aldosterone The hypothalamus secretes a number of hromones such as Gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GNRH) The anterior pituitary secretes a number of hormones such as Growth hormone (GH)
urinary system,124,A 72-year-old female presents with general slowness. Examination reveals a tremor of the hands. What frequency of tremor would you suspect in Parkinson's disease?,1 Hz,2 Hz,5 Hz,8 Hz,10 Hz,C,The typical tremor associated with Parkinson's disease is 4-6 Hz although in a minority the tremor may be faster - 8 Hz. This rate is more typical of essential tremor.
urinary system,125,A 40-year-old patient is being evaluated in your clinic for headaches. On examination you notice that the left pupil constricts and then enlarges and constricts again while shining the pen torch on the eye. What is this finding called?,Hippus,Horner's pupil,Iridocyclitis,Relative afferent papillary defect,Tonic pupil,A,"Hippus is papillary athetosis. It is typically a benign finding. It is a spasmodic rhythmical dilation and contraction of the pupil. It is particularly noticeable when pupils are tested with a light, but is independent of eye movements or light. Pathological hippus is rare but is recognised with aconite poisoning, trauma, cirrhosis and renal disease (possibly due to frontal lobe dysfunction).  Iridocyclitis is inflammation of the uvea and is a form of anterior uveitis. A relative afferent papillary defect is detected with the swinging light test, however in this case the pen torch is held on one eye only. A Horner's pupil is a miotic pupil caused by damage to the sympathetic chain. A tonic pupil or Holmes-Adie pupil is a dilated pupil caused by parasympathetic damage."
urinary system,126,Which of the following diabetic medications increases the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy?,Acarbose,Exenatide,Gliclazide,Insulin,Metformin,E,"Contrast-induced nephropathy is a complication of intravenous contrast given during some radiological procedures. Existing renal impairment, dehydration and the use of metformin increase the risk of this. Metformin is usually withheld for 48 hours after the use of contrast. Acarbose should not be selected because it is a post-postprandial glucose regulator and has no relation to contrast-induced nephropathy. Likewise, the remaining incorrect options are safe to use after the administration of intravenous contrast and do not increase the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. "
urinary system,127,"A 32 year old woman with one child has been referred by her GP with a 1 month history of urine leakage on running and exercising. She has no urgency, and her frequency is four to six times during the day and once at night. She has no prolapse or bowel symptoms. She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery 2 months ago and currently breast feeding. She is planning to have another child in about 2 years. On examination her BMI was 22. General and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Vaginal examination showed a no evidence of pelvic organ prolapse. Her cervix was healthy and the uterus was anteverted and normal size with no adnexal masses. There was no demonstrable stress urinary incontinence. Her urine analysis was normal. What is the most appropriate next management step?",Bladder retraining,Supervised pelvic floor exercises,Topical estrogen therapy,Treatment with duloxetine,Urodynamics,B,This is recommended by NICE as the first step in managing women with stress urinary incontinence. This patient is still breastfeeding and lack of estrogen also increases her risk of stress urinary incontinence. Weight reduction is also advisable.
urinary system,128,"A 27-year-old lady presents with generalised oedema of five months duration. Investigations reveal proteinuria (5.5 g/day), hypoproteinaemia and hypercholesterolaemia, urea 10 mmol/L (2.5-7.5) and creatinine 200 mol/L (60-110). Renal biopsy confirms membranous glomerulonephritis. What will be the most appropriate management to get remission?",Azathiaprine,Cyclophosphamide plus methylprednisolone,Cyclosporin A,Methylprednisolone,Protein restriction,B,"The twin aims of treating membranous nephropathy are:  First to induce a remission of the nephrotic syndrome, and Second to prevent the development of end stage renal failure.  A meta-analysis of four randomised controlled studies comparing treatments of membranous nephropathy showed that regimes comprising chlorambucil or cyclophosphamide, either alone or with steroids, were more effective than symptomatic treatment or treatment with steroids alone in inducing remission of the nephrotic syndrome. A small randomised controlled study of 17 patients with a persistent nephrotic syndrome and declining renal function suggested that ciclosporin A slowed the rate of decline of renal function: this requires confirmation in a larger trial."

urinary system,130,"A 70 year old male with previous radiation therapy for colorectal carcinoma presents with non specific symptoms of weight loss, malaise, nausea and dull abdominal and back pain. He has also noticed increased frequency and hesitancy of urination. Bloods reveal a normochromic anaemia, increased ESR and renal failure.. His renal failure does not improve with fluids and an ultrasound is organised. This reveals a retroperitoneal mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Recurrence of colorectal carcinoma,Aortic aneurysm,Retroperitoneal fibrosis,Amyloidosis,Pancreatic carcinoma,C,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis is rare. It is characterised by fibro inflammatory tissue around the aorta and iliac arteries, into the retroperitoneum and surrounding other structures such as the ureters. It is thought to be an autoimmune process to insoluble lipid leaking from atherosclerotic plaques. This can lead to an obstructive uropathy as seen here. In the majority there is no clear underlying cause found however t has been associated with aortic aneurysm, renal tract trauma, infection, retroperitoneal malignancy, post irradiation and chemotherapy and with certain drugs such as methysergide, beta blockers, methyldopa and amphetamines. It has also been associated with certain autoimmune disease and vasculitis such as PBC, Rheumatoid arthritis, SLE and polyarteritis nodosa. Lymphomas, sarcoma , pancreatic carcinomas and other malignancies can also lead to similar appearances to it on ultrasound and these are therefore differentials. However in this case the previous radiation therapy is a clue and MRI can be utilised to assess further the degree of fibrosis. A biopsy may be required if the other differentials cannot be excluded. Intravenous urography is useful in assessing the degree of ureteric obstruction. Removal of the offending agent, steroids, immunosuppressants and ureterolysis and ureteric stent placement for obstruction have all been utilised in the management."
urinary system,131,An 18-year-old female presents 12 weeks into an unplanned pregnancy. She had been diagnosed with epilepsy six years ago which was well controlled on sodium valproate and had been taking the combined oral contraceptive pill for three years. Which of the following is correct concerning this patient?,Lamotrigine should be substituted for sodium valproate,She should be advised to have a termination of her pregnancy,Sodium valproate interaction with the oral contraceptive increased the risk of pregnancy,The dose of sodium valproate should be increased,There is an increased risk of a neural tube defect in her fetus,E,"This patient has become pregnant on valproate. This therapy has controlled her seizures and should not be changed now. However, there is an increased risk of neural tube defects associated with valproate and this could have been reduced by folate therapy early in pregnancy (NTD's occur in the first month of pregnancy). Valproate is not an enzyme inducer and unlike other anticonvulsants would not speed up metabolism of the OCP. It is entirely up to the individual whether she wishes to pursue the pregnancy or not."
urinary system,132,Which one of the following is true of undescended testes?,25% of undescended testes descend in the first year of life,Is associated with a reduced risk of testicular malignancy,Is associated with normal fertility,Laparoscopy is indicated for impalpable testes,Surgery should be considered in the neonatal period,D,"Undescended testes affect 3% of full-term boys. However, the majority of these lie in the inguinal canal and approximately 75% of undescended testes descend into the scrotum during the first year of life. Undescended testes are associated with an increased risk of testicular malignancy which develops in 5% of intra-abdominal testes. Overall, 80% of males with bilateral descended testes are fertile but only 30% of men with bilateral undescended testes have normal fertility. Surgery should be performed at 12-18 months of age. Boys with an undescended but palpable testis should undergo a routine orchidopexy. Impalpable testes should be assessed with laparoscopy"
urinary system,133,Which one of the following drugs is associated with hypersensitivity reactions?,Atazanavir,Lamivudine,Nevirapine,Tenofovir,Zidovudine,C,Nevirapine can cause acute hepatitis and skin rash as a part of hypersensitive reaction especially when the CD4 count is over 250 cells/ml in women and over 400 cells/ml in men. Nevirapine should not be prescribed in those conditions. Atazanavir causes hyperbilirubinaemia and rarely renal stones. Lamivudine does not cause hypersensitivity reaction. Tenofovir causes proximal tubular damage. Zidovudine causes bone marrow suppression. 
urinary system,134,A 22-year-old female is diagnosed with cystinuria following recurrent episodes of renal colic. Which of the following is characteristic of cystinuria?,Autosomal dominant inheritance,Cataracts,Cystine deposition within the liver,Premature coronary artery disease,Radio-opaque renal calculi on CT-KUB,E,"Cystinuria is an autosomal recessive condition associated with the inadequate reabsorption of cystine (as well as ornithine, arginine, and lysine; useful mnemonic COAL) in the nephron causing nephrolithiasis. The stones are usually radio-opaque on CT (as are the majority of renal stones), but radiolucent on plain film. Cystinuria accounts for less than 3% of renal calculi and has an incidence of 1 in 2,500. The foundation of cystine stone prevention is adequate hydration and urinary alkalinisation. It has no affect on cataract formation, cardiovascular disease or organ cystine deposition."
urinary system,135,A 9-month-old boy presents with an acute scrotal swelling. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute idiopathic scrotal oedema,Epididymitis,Irreducible inguinal hernia,Orchitis,Torsion of the testicular appendix,C,"With any acute swollen scrotum the fear is of torsion of testis. This is uncommon in the neonate, and is much commoner around puberty. Presentation is with a hard, tender testis, and spermatic cord -/+ a red scrotum. Torsion of the appendix of testis has a peak incidence of between 4 and 8 years of age, as does acute idiopathic scrotal oedema. In the former, there is a tender upper pole of testis with a blue spot on transillumination. In the latter the erythema extends beyond the scrotum and the testis is minimally tender. Epididymitis is rare before puberty, and presents with a tender epididymus (urological investigations are needed, as it is associated with reflux of infected urine via the vas deferens). Inguinal herniae which are irreducible, have a peak incidence below 2 years of age. A firm immobile tender swelling is found in the scrotum, which becomes inflamed as the strangulation occurs. Occasionally, acute hydroceles can also present with a mobile blue transilluminating swelling at 1-3 years of age."
urinary system,136,"A 51-year-old woman with a clear cell tumour of the kidney, is being investigated for unexplained symptoms. Which of the following is a non-metastatic consequences of renal carcinoma?",Cerebellar ataxia,Hypocalcaemia,Hyponatraemia,Myasthenia gravis,Polycythaemia,E,The non-metastatic consequences of renal carcinoma include the synthesis of erythropoietin which may cause polycythaemia and hypercalcaemia through parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related peptide synthesis. It may also be associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and leucopenia.
urinary system,137,"A 28-year-old man with HIV presents with a five-day history of feeling unwell. He is a heavy smoker. A chest radiograph showed right upper lobe consolidation. His CD4 count was 468 cells/mm^3. HIV RNA level was 90,678 copies/ml. He is not on any antiretroviral treatment. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bronchial carcinoma,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,Pulmonary tuberculosis,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP),Streptococcal pneumonia,E,"This is typical of community-acquired pneumonia. One should think of common infections rather than any opportunistic infections in HIV patients with good CD4 counts. (More than 400 cells/mm^3 is not immunocompromised.) It is not a typical history for bronchial carcinoma as the history was short and radiographic changes were not typical of bronchial carcinoma. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is unlikely in a patient with good CD4 count. Pulmonary tuberculosis typically causes cavitating lesions in a patient with a good CD4 count. PCP commonly occurs in patients with CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm^3 and chest radiograph shows bilateral infiltrates from the hila without any effusion or lymphadenopathy. The history is too short for tuberculosis, and apart from HIV there aren't any other risk factors for this."
urinary system,138,"A 58-year-old man with long-standing hypertension was found to have a serum creatinine concentration of 275 µmol/L (60-110). Urinalysis showed blood ++ and protein greater than1 g/L. Renal ultrasound showed the left kidney to be 9.2 cm long, the right to be 8.9 cm long (normal range for both kidneys 10-12 cm), and neither kidney was obstructed. What is the best investigation to diagnose the cause of the renal impairment?",Intravenous urography,Isotope renography,Renal arteriography,Renal biopsy,Retrograde pyelography,D,"The presence of long standing hypertension, haematuria, significant non-nephrotic proteinuria is highly suspicious of glomerular pathology, such as IgA nephropathy which is best characterised by a renal biopsy. In the absence of obstruction on ultrasound, intravenous urography, retrograde pyelography, and isotope renography are not appropriate. Renal size asymmetry in the presence of hypertension and renal impairment might prompt the search for renovascular disease. However in this case of kidneys are of similar and good size."

He says this happened suddenly and he woke up with problems with his vision the morning before coming to the Emergency department. Medication includes clopidogrel, ramipril, atorvastatin, and metformin. On examination his BP is 165/100 mmHg, his pulse is 76 and regular. Visual field examination reveals a right homonymous upper quadrantanopia. Where is the most likely site for the underlying lesion?",Left occipital lobe,Left temporal lobe,Optic chiasm,Right optic nerve,Right temporal lobe,B,"Temporal lobe lesions result in a contralateral homonymous superior quadrantanopia. The most likely cause in this case is a thromboembolic event affecting the left temporal lobe, which is consistent with his history of multiple TIAs.  Occipital lobe lesions result in cortical blindness. Lesions of the optic chiasm result in complex defects depending on which fibres are most affected, but the classical lesion described is bilateral homonymous hemianopia.  An optic nerve lesion results in ipsilateral blindness.  "

urinary system,142,A 40-year-old man is admitted with a one day history of increasing drowsiness. He had a diarrhoeal illness two weeks ago from which he made a full recovery. His wife says that over the past three days he had developed double vision and had begun to 'walk like he was drunk'. On examination he has mild proximal weakness and brisk symmetrical reflexes. Sensation is intact and plantars are down going. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bickerstaff's encephalitis,Miller-Fisher variant Guillain-Barré syndrome,Multiple sclerosis,Wallenberg's syndrome,Weber's syndrome,A,"Bickerstaff's encephalitis is usually preceded by an infection, typically Campylobacter jejuni. It is associated with autoantibodies against gangliosides, typically anti-GQ1b IgG, in the serum. Bickerstaff's encephalitis affects the brainstem, this may be seen on MRI with hyperintensities on T2 weighted images. It causes drowsiness, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and brisk reflexes. The drowsiness and brisk reflexes can be used to differentiate it from Miller-Fisher. Bickerstaff's encephalitis is the answer. This is a rare immune disorder affecting the brainstem. It is usually preceded by an infection, typically Campylobacter jejuni. It is associated with autoantibodies against gangliosides, typically anti-GQ1b IgG, in the serum. It causes drowsiness, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and brisk reflexes. The drowsiness and brisk reflexes can be used to differentiate it from Miller-Fisher. It may be seen on MRI as hyperintensities in the brain stem on T2 weighted images. Miller-Fisher variant Guillain-Barré syndrome is not the answer as it is not associated with drowsiness and typically causes reduced or absent reflexes. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is not the answer. The history is very acute for MS and there is no association with diarrhoea. MS is not typically associated with drowsiness. Wallenberg's syndrome is not the answer. This is most commonly caused by infarction of the lateral medulla. It causes ipsilateral Horner's syndrome, loss of facial pin-prick and temperature sensation, with preserved light touch and corneal reflex. There is contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense in the limbs and trunk. Weber's syndrome is not the answer. This is a lesion of the cerebral peduncle and causes an ipsilateral third nerve lesion and contralateral hemiparesis."
urinary system,143,Acute renal failure may be distinguished from chronic renal failure by which of the following?,An increased urinary Na excretion,Hyperkalaemia,Hypophosphataemia,Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) on the ECG,Renal size on ultrasound scan (USS),E,"Small kidneys on USS suggest chronic renal failure but the following causes of chronic renal failure can present with normal/enlarged kidneys:  Amyloidosis Polycystic kidney disease Diabetic glomerulosclerosis Scleroderma Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.  Decreased fractional Na clearance, hyperphosphataemia and hyperkalaemia are features of acute or chronic renal failure. LVH is probably more likely to be seen in chronic renal failure but is not reliable."
urinary system,144,"The kidney plays a number of important homeostatic and excretory roles. Despite being a small percentage of total body mass, it receives a significant proportion of the cardiac output. Which of the following answers best estimates the proportion of cardiac output to the kidneys under normal physiological conditions?",5%,10%,20%,40%,50%,C,"The kidney requires a significant proportion of the cardiac output to fulfil its functions. The actual value of cardiac output can vary depending on different physiological states (for example, stress and hypovolaemia) but approximately 20-25% of the cardiac output goes towards the kidney. Therefore 20% is correct. The other options are incorrect estimates and should not be selected."
urinary system,145,Which of the following concerning the pH of urine is correct?,Is a useful indicator of the acid/base balance of the blood,Is determined by the concentration of ammonium,Is lower than 5.5 in renal tubular acidosis (RTA),Rises on a vegetarian diet,Would be above 7.0 after prolonged and severe vomiting,D,"Urine pH is affected by diet, with vegetarians having more alkaline urine when compared with omnivores. Animal proteins contained in meat, eggs and cheese are often converted into acidic products (for example, amino acids) during digestion, absorption or metabolism. This provides a daily increase in the body's acid content, which has to be excreted by the kidneys. For people eating a vegetarian diet, consumption of foods rich in citrate or carbonated drinks raise the urine pH. Other situations can interfere with this balance, such as tubular function or bacterial infection, which often promotes an alkaline urine pH due to the presence of bacterial enzymes converting urea to ammonia. Urine pH has variable effects upon stone formation. The solubility of uric acid is markedly decreased in an acidic solution so uric acid stones are more likely to form. However, calcium phosphate becomes less soluble at pH greater than6; hence calcium phosphate stones are more likely to form in an alkaline urine. Therefore dietary advice needs to be tailored to the clinical scenario. Excretion of ammonium occurs when an acid urine is produced but the pH of urine is of course determined by the concentration of H+ ions. Unable to lower the pH to less than 5.5 in type 1 RTA. A pH of above 7.0 after prolonged and severe vomiting would be expected in an attempt to compensate for the loss of acid; however, when there is extracellular fluid depletion the retention of sodium takes priority. Instead of bicarbonate being excreted it is reabsorbed in the proximal and distal nephron and this perpetuates the metabolic alkalosis until the fluid balance is restored with intravenous (IV) fluids.

urinary system,146,"A 67-year-old male presents to his GP with urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, and poor stream. An enlarged prostate is felt on digital rectal examination. Urine dipstick shows nitrites, leukocytes, protein, and blood. He is prescribed nitrofurantoin. His GP would like to check his PSA. When should his PSA be checked?",Check in three days,Check in one week,Check in two weeks,Check on this occasion,No need to check PSA,C,"PSA concentrations can rise with problems of false positives after catheterisation and particularly urine tract infections. Therefore, if one has decided to check a PSA then it is recommended that this should be measured at least two weeks after a treated UTI. Please bear in mind that this is a controversial area and one where the guidelines are not completely clear. You would expect some prostatic symptoms in patients with prostatic carcinoma, but most of these will actually have BPH rather than carcinoma. Many men will come requesting a PSA and it can be useful in those patients with a family history, young age etc. In practice it would probably be worth checking it in a male presenting with a UTI, as such a diagnosis is fairly rare in this age group. It is important to allow the infection to clear first however, to reduce the risk of a false positive result."
urinary system,147,"Which of the following is the best imaging to identify renal scarring, for instance after childhood febrile urinary tract infection?",Intravenous pyelography,Renal DMSA scintigraphy,Renal DTPA scintigraphy,Renal ultrasonography,Voiding cystourethrography,B,"Renal scintigraphy with DMSA involves administration of radioactive isotope which is avidly taken up by the renal parenchyma. This permits the identification of regions of decreased uptake that may represent acute inflammation (such as pyelonephritis) or renal scarring. The technique of dimercaptosuccinic acid DMSA scan also allows detection of congenital renal disorder. A small kidney with uniform uptake of DMSA is likely to represent congenital hypodysplasia, whereas a focal area of reduced cortical uptake associated with loss of contours is more likely to represent an infection-related scar. Renal DTPA involves an isotope that is exclusively filtered by the glomeruli, and is used to give a andquot;perfusion indexandquot; and evaluate excretion (obstruction assessment) of the kidney. Voiding cystourethrography is used to determine whether there is vesicoureteral reflux, which might give an increased risk (but not diagnostic) of renal scarring. Ultrasonography also does not reliably detect low-grade scarring."
urinary system,148,"A 26-year-old man is referred to the clinic with microscopic haematuria. He also has hypertension, which the GP diagnosed as essential hypertension and commenced him on amlodipine 5 mg daily. You understand on further questioning that his brother has haematuria and renal impairment and his father died of a stroke at the age of 42. On examination his blood pressure is 152/88 mmHg, he has bilateral ballotable kidneys.

Given that his father had a stroke at a young age, this raises the possibility of a berry aneurysm and subsequent subarachnoid haemorrhage. ADPKD affects as many as 1 in 1000 individuals and is responsible for around 10% of the UK dialysis burden. Polycystic liver disease is seen in 80% of patients but is usually asymptomatic. Abdominal ultrasound has a sensitivity approaching 100% for patients above 20 years of age. Hypertension should be aggressively managed, with ACE inhibitors the therapy of choice."
urinary system,149,Which of the following statements is true of acute compartment syndrome?,Loss of distal pulse is an early sign,Only occurs following fractures,Passive stretch of affected muscles exacerbates pain,Rarely requires surgical intervention,The presence of pain is unhelpful in diagnosis,C,"Loss of peripheral pulses is a late sign indicating that the pressure within the compartment has exceeded arterial blood pressure. Compartment syndrome can occur in the absence of a fracture, for example, crush injuries. Passive stretch of the muscles traversing the compartment increases pain. Treatment involves decompression of the affected compartment(s) including the skin. Pain is the earliest and most reliable symptom of the onset of compartment syndrome."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alport's syndrome,Goodpasture's syndrome,Polymyositis,Relapsing polychondritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,B,"The combination of haemoptysis (with radiological findings consistent with pulmonary haemorrhage) and red cell casts in the urine (indicating glomerular bleeding) should lead you to consider a diagnosis of Goodpasture's syndrome in this case. Goodpasture's syndrome is an important, and potentially rapidly fatal, cause of alveolar haemorrhage and rapidly progressive renal failure. It is caused by circulating antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, and typically causes an acute glomerulonephritis. It usually presents in young men in their twenties and men and women in their sixties. Despite treatment the mortality of Goodpasture's is 11% and it has a high morbidity with 60% of patients becoming dependent on dialysis. Renal impairment is caused by a crescentic glomerulonephritis. It frequently has an eruptive presentation in the young, with:  cough fever haemoptysis haematuria proteinuria, and red cell casts.  The pulmonary haemorrhage and glomerular bleeding can result in a drop in haemoglobin. The most common antibody associated with Goodpasture's is antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies (anti-GBM). Anti-GBM antibodies are directed against the Goodpasture antigen, which is part of the non-collagenous domain of the alpha-3(4) collagen chain. However, recently it has been shown that in a significant number of patients with Goodpasture's syndrome antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) can coexist with anti-GBM antibodies - in one study 30% of patients had positive ANCA serology. In this setting, ANCA is usually specific for p-ANCA and is directed against myeloperoxidase. In general, both antibodies can be detected at presentation. This seropositivity has been shown to have important clinical and prognostic implications, and these patients may develop extra-renal and extra-pulmonary manifestations. In addition, they are more likely to have recurrent renal or pulmonary disease. Prognosis is debated with some studies saying it is more favourable in patients with positive ANCA and others showing a worse outcome in these patients. Plasmapheresis and immunosuppression (typically with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroid) are the treatments of choice in Goodpasture's syndrome. This has been shown to reduce anti-GBM antibodies most rapidly, which results in improved morbidity and mortality. Plasmapheresis is typically given daily or on alternate days for two to three weeks. Response is assessed by monitoring symptoms and anti-GBM antibody titres. Cyclophosphamide and prednisolone then continue, typically for six to nine months following remission. Alport's syndrome is a familial nephritis which presents with haematuria, progressive renal failure, ocular abnormalities and sensorineural deafness. It is caused by a mutation in the type IV collagen genes. Inheritance is variable, but the majority are X-linked dominant (85%; 15% are autosomal recessive). There is a high spontaneous mutation rate, which means 20% of patients have no family history. Polymyositis classically presents with relatively painless progressive proximal muscle weakness. Dysphagia is common but the ocular muscles are very rare. Diagnosis of polymyositis is confirmed by elevated muscle enzymes (creatine kinase) and typical EMG and muscle biopsy findings. Relapsing polychondritis is characterised by recurrent episodes of inflammation of cartilaginous structures (joints, respiratory tract, ear, nose) and connective tissue (heart, eye, blood vessels, inner ear). Antibodies to type II collagen may be present. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogeneous, inflammatory, multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disease, in which antinuclear antibodies occur. Its presentation and course are highly variable, ranging from indolent to fulminant. The triad of fever, arthralgia and rash in a woman of childbearing age should suggest the diagnosis. "

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Analgesic misuse headache,Cerebral tumor,Cluster headache,Headache due to depression,Migraine,A,"The two commonest causes of chronic daily headache are tension type headache and analgesic misuse headache. The latter is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms. It usually occurs as a result of chronic use of analgesics such as codeine phosphate and paracetamol. Typically the headache is relieved with the analgesics just to return in the next hours. Treatment is abrupt withdrawal of the offending agent. Withdrawal symptoms are likely to occur, including worsening headache, nausea, agitation and sleep disturbance.

He states that even when he has been well that when his urine has been dipped there is still a trace of blood. He is found to be hypertensive. Given the most likely diagnosis, what antihypertensive is the treatment of choice?",Ramipril,Bendroflumethiazide,Losartan,Amlodipine,Atenolol,A,"The most likely diagnosis here is IgA nephropathy or Buergers disease which most often presents as frank haematuria associated with URTI but also gastroenteritis, UTIs and pneumonia. There can be persistence f microscopic haematuria and it is the most common cause of isolated persistent microscopic haematuria. Immune complexes of IgA become lodged in glomeruli and there is complement fixation. This leads to mesangial proliferation with prominent IgA deposition predominantly. Hypertension can occur and this requires early treatment with ACE inhibitors being the treatment of choice and are thought to reduce proteinuria even if the patient is normotensive. Corticosteroids are given if there is evidence of nephrotic syndrome and in those with proliferative IgA nephropathy ad moderate proteinuria it can slow deterioration of renal function. Cyclophosphamide may also be useful. Chronic renal failure and end stage renal failure can develop in approximately 20 to 40%."

Hallucinations are usually visual or tactile, but may be auditory and persecutory. Delirium tremens is associated with a much more profound disorientation and agitation, with severe autonomic dysfunction and cardiovascular collapse. It may well be preceded by alcohol withdrawal seizures. Delerium tremens starts 48-96 hours after the last drink. Anything more rapid is unlikely to be DT, however severe.

On examination, the BP is 190/100 mm Hg, and there are 3+ proteins, 3+ blood in her urine. What is the diagnosis?",Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis,Membranous glomerulonephritis,Mesangial glomerulonephritis,Minimal change glomerulonephritis,Nephrotic syndrome,A,"Hypertension, pedal oedema, nephritic urinary sediments (blood and protein positive) in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suggests the diagnosis of class IV (diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis) or class III (focal segmental glomerulonephritis) lupus nephritis. ds-DNA antibodies increase the risk of lupus nephritis. Mesangial glomerulonephritis presents with mild proteinuria. Minimal change, or membranous glomerulonephritis present with proteinuria, which may be in the nephrotic range. The renal manifestations of SLE are highly variable, ranging from mild asymptomatic proteinuria and/or haematuria to rapidly progressive uraemia. The various presentations are difficult to classify into clinical syndromes and histological classes. Although lupus nephritis affects a third of patients early in the disease it is frequently unrecognised until nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome with renal failure occur. Histologically, a number of different types of renal diseases are recognised in SLE, with immune-complex mediated glomerular disease being the most common. The standard classification divides these into five different patterns:  I - No disease II - Mesangial III - Focal proliferative IV - Diffuse proliferative V - Membranous.  Mesangial nephritis represents the earliest and mildest form of glomerular involvement. It presents clinically as microscopic haematuria and/or proteinuria. Hypertension is uncommon and nephrotic syndrome and renal impairment are very rarely seen. Biopsy demonstrates segmental areas of increased mesangial matrix and cellularity. The prognosis is good and specific treatment is indicated only if the disease progresses. Focal proliferative disease is more advanced, but still affects less than 50% of glomeruli. Haematuria and proteinuria is almost always seen, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and elevated creatinine may be present. Electron microscopy shows immune deposits in the subendothelial space of the glomerular capillary wall and the mesangium. Prognosis is variable. Diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common and severe form of lupus nephritis. Haematuria and proteinuria are almost always present, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and renal impairment common. Biopsies demonstrate profuse deposits of IgG within the glomeruli. Immunosuppressive therapy is required in these cases to prevent progression to end-stage renal failure. Patients with membranous lupus nephritis tend to present with nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic haematuria and hypertension may also be seen. Biopsies show diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall. Progression is variable, and immunosuppression is not always needed. With regard to the management of lupus nephritis, a biopsy is indicated in those patients with abnormal urinalysis and/or reduced renal function. This can provide a histological classification as well as information regarding activity, chronicity and prognosis. Cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine reduce mortality in proliferative forms of lupus glomerulonephritis. "

This man should have been investigated at the time of his symptoms, and it is difficult to assess what should be done now. Nothing is indicated urgently, and therefore he should be referred to a specialist as an outpatient where the the risks and benefits can be weighed up.

He is diagnosed with Henoch Schonlein purpura. Which of the following should be utilised initially in the management?",Azathioprine,Ibuprofen,IV fluids,Prednisolone,Paracetamol,B,"HSP is an autoimmune, small vessel vasculitis. It typically leads to characteristic purpuric rash and can lead to arthritis,  abdominal pain and renal disease. It is predominantly a disease of childhood however when it affects adults it has a poorer diagnosis and renal involvement is normally worse. Renal involvement can range from microscopic haemturia and proteinuria to renal failure. In children it is normally self resolving and therapy is supportive. NSAIDs are useful for joint pains. Steroids are very useful in the management of arthralgia and abdominal pain. Steroids have not been shown to prevent progression of renal disease. IV steroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide and plasmapheresis have been utilised for the management of severe renal disease. In this case the patient is very well and there is only mild joint pain therefore it would be reasonable to try NSAIDs in the initial stages and only commence steroids if the patient's symptoms or renal function deteriorates. Urinalysis and renal function should be monitored however to ensure there is no deterioration. As mentioned HSP has a good prognosis and in the majority it is self limiting."
urinary system,164,"A 28-year-old female, three days postpartum, develops severe headache associated with seizures. During her pregnancy, her blood pressure had been mildly elevated in the third trimester. On examination, she had a GCS of 15 but was slightly confused and drowsy. Her temperature was 37.5°C, she had mild nuchal rigidity but neurological examination was otherwise normal. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial meningitis ,Cortical vein thrombosis,Eclampsia,Intracerebral haemorrhage,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,B,"Postpartum period is a risk factor of cortical vein and sinus thrombosis. It typically presents with headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficit two to three weeks postpartum (but is also seen earlier). Other clinical presentations include an idiopathic intracranial hypertension (BIH) type of picture (papilloedema, visual disturbances, and headaches) or a subacute encephalopathic picture. Thrombophilia screen should be performed. Eclampsia typically improves following delivery but despite this 1/3 of seizures occur in the four days following delivery, the seizures can in fact occur antepartum, intrapartum, or postpartum. If a seizure does occur postpartum, it usually occurs within the first 24 hours after delivery. Although eclampsia would be in the differential diagnosis in this case, nuchal rigidity is not a typical feature which points more to the direction of cortical vein thrombosis. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is less often associated with seizures than a cortical vein thrombosis. In addition, patients with significant subarachnoid haemorrhage are usually very meningitic with photophobia and significant neck stiffness and pain."
urinary system,165,A 24-year-old female presents with vague frontal headaches and visual disturbance. She has a past history of acne for which she is receiving treatment. Examination reveals her to be obese with a blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg. There is absence of the central retinal vein pulsation on fundoscopic examination. Which of the following drugs account for these findings?,Ampicillin ,Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP),Erythromycin,Isotretinoin,Topical tetracycline,B,"COCP, like many oral contraceptives, may be associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Topical tetracycline is not associated with IIH. Isotretinoin is very rarely (less than1:10,000) associated with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. When it is seen it is usually when isotretinoin is used in combination with tetracyclines, which is why use of these drugs together is advised against."
urinary system,166,A 55-year-old man who has received haemodialysis for many years presents with deteriorating discomfort in both shoulders. Past medical history included bilateral carpal tunnel decompression. His investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 100 g/L (130-180)   ESR 30 mm/1^st hr (1-10)   C reactive protein 12 mg/L (less than10)   Urate 0.58 mmol/L (less than0.45)    What is the most likely diagnosis?,ß2 microglobulin amyloidosis,Gout,Osteoarthritis,Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR),Pseudogout,A,The features of shoulder pain associated with a past history of carpal tunnel syndrome in a patient receiving haemodialysis suggests a diagnosis of ß2 microglobulin amyloidosis. Amyloid deposits composed of ß2 microglobulin as the major constituent protein are mainly localised in joints and periarticular bone and lead to destructive arthropathy which tends to develop five to ten years after the initiation of dialysis. Death from amyloidosis of gut and heart may occur after 20 years of dialysis. Gout and pseudogout are crystal arthopathies casuing paiun often in small joints.  Osteoarthritis affects larger joints and PMR causes pain and stiffness of muscles around the shoulders and neck.
urinary system,167,The healthy adult kidney excretes 5400 mg per week of phosphate. What is the maximum amount of phosphate that can be removed by dialysis per week in a patient with anuric renal failure who is dialysis dependent?,200 mg,500 mg,800 mg,2700 mg,5000 mg,D,"This question illustrates the problem with phosphate clearance in patients with renal failure. Dialysis is able to remove only about half of the phosphate that the healthy kidney would be able to do. 2700 mg is correct and the other answers are incorrect. In such patients, strict dietary control and the use of phosphate binders are necessary to prevent accumulation of phosphate. "
urinary system,168,A 2-year-old patient presents with colicky pain which radiates from loin to groin. He complains of similar episodes in the past. Investigation has been done and 7mm stone was found in the ureter. What is the most appropriate management?,Percutaneous nephrolithotomy,Open surgery,Ureteroscopy or laser,Conservative treatment,ESWL,E,"Given its minimally invasive features, extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) has become a primary mode of treatment for the pediatric patients with reno- ureteral stones"
urinary system,169,"A 45-year-old man on regular haemodialysis complained of weakness and exertional fatigue. On examination, his blood pressure was 170/105 mmHg (pre-dialysis) and 160/95 mmHg (post-dialysis). Investigations pre-dialysis revealed:    Haemoglobin 90 g/L (130-180)   Serum potassium 6.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum creatinine 1250 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum corrected calcium 2.1 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)    Which intervention is most likely to improve his symptoms?",Correct hypocalcaemia with alfacalcidol,Improve blood pressure control with ramipril,Increase haemoglobin with epoetin,Increase the length of each dialysis session,Lower the potassium in the dialysate,C,"This is a tough question with many possible answers. But importantly, this question asks how to improve his symptoms. Changing the question around, such as how to improve blood pressure or how to improve prognosis, alters the answer. There are several deficiencies in the management of this patient with end stage renal failure. The symptoms described are more in keeping with his anaemia. A mild hypocalcaemia and hyperkalaemia would not give rise to his symptoms. This also applies to his uncontrolled hypertension. The combination of high pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure, and high pre-dialysis potassium indicate that this patient is receiving inadequate dialysis. Both procedural issues (insufficient blood flow rate, dialysis time and frequency and needle size) and access issues should be addressed. However, this is unlikely to drastically improve his symptoms and therefore correcting his anaemia remains the correct option here. Bearing in mind the above the question specifically asks what intervention would improve his symptoms. As his symptoms are likely caused by anaemia, one would have to elect EPO irrespective of blood pressure, calcium, etc. The causes of anaemia in haemodialysis patients are numerous. Firstly, there is insufficient production of erythropoietin (EPO) and, secondly, iron deficiency is present in most. The tubing of dialysis equipment causes continued low-level blood loss, there may be chronic inflammation any other vitamin deficiencies (or folic acid) and gastrointestinal absorption of iron is often reduced. In addition, uraemic toxins can inhibit erythropoiesis, and it appears there is shortened red cell survival in chronic renal failure (possibly due to haemolysis). If left untreated, the anaemia of chronic kidney disease is associated with deterioration in cardiac function, increased risk of stroke, decreased cognition and mental acuity and fatigues. Treating anaemia in these patients markedly improves quality of life, and decreases morbidity and mortality. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and European Revised Evidence-Based Practice 2004 Guidelines recommend maintaining a haemoglobin greater than110 g/L with a haematocrit less than33%. Ideally, before starting EPO in renal patients you should get their haematinics (iron, B12, folate) to ensure they are replete of all. If any are found to be low they should be replaced. However, there is not an option to check and replace these and therefore EPO is the most correct answer here. "
urinary system,170,"A 60 year old male is noted to have macroglossia, hepatomegaly and has waxy papules in the eyelids, neck and groin.  He complains of symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.  He has now developed oedema and is found to have nephrotic syndrome.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Minimal change disease,Amyloidosis,Hypercholesterolaemia,Glomerulonephritis,Scleroderma,B,"The macroglossia, hepatomegaly, skin lesions and carpal tunnel syndrome are typical of primary amyloidosis.  This can lead to the nephrotic syndrome.  It can affect other organs such as the heart.  On biopsy there would be deposits which show green birefringence after staining with congo red."
urinary system,171,A 65-year-old gentleman with type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension is started on an ACE-inhibitor. Which of the following is the most appropriate time period to check his creatinine and potassium after commencing the medication?,24 hours after starting the medication,48 hours after starting the medication,One to two weeks after starting the medication,Six hours after he takes the medication,Two months after starting the medication,C,"Monitoring of renal function and potassium is important after commencement of an ACE inhibitor. The optimum period to check this is one to two weeks after commencing the medication. Six, 24 and 48 hours after starting the medication are too early to detect relevant changes. These answers should not be selected. Two months after starting the medication is too late and should not be selected. "
urinary system,172,A 55-year-old man presents with a resting tremor of his right arm and a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson's disease is made. Which one of the following drugs is most likely to help his tremor?,Amantadine,Benzhexol,Cabergoline,Co-careldopa,Selegiline,B,"Anticholinergic treatment (for example, benzhexol) is the treatment of choice for tremor predominantly Parkinson's disease. L-dopa and dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice for bradykinesia and rigidity."

This is the third episode over the past two years, and on each of the previous two occasions, the problem has been treated with oral corticosteroids. On examination, he has periorbital and bilateral lower limb pitting oedema. His BP is 125/72 mmHg, pulse is 72 and regular. He has no significant findings on auscultation of the chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 5.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 260 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (79-118)   Albumin 24 g/L (35-50)   Urine Protein +++    Which of the following is the most appropriate initial way to treat him?",Admit for methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide,Observe,Prednisolone 10 mg/day for six weeks,Prednisolone 60 mg/day for six weeks,Trial of ramipril,D,"The repeated cycles of corticosteroid responsive nephrotic syndrome suggest that this individual has minimal change disease. Therefore he is likely once again to respond to high dose prednisolone, with a tapering dose after the first six weeks of therapy. In patients who fail to respond initially to corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and ciclosporin are optional second line agents. There are no strict indications for these, but tend to be used if there is steroid resistance or dependence, partial response to steroids, frequent relapses, and toxicity or contraindications to steroids. These agents can be used sequentially if there is a failure to respond.    Evidence- "

Which of the following statements concerning this case is correct?,She is likely to have been prescribed olanzapine,She is unlikely to have a recurrence,She should be observed without treatment,She should be treated with parenteral procyclidine,She should receive procyclidine as long-term prophylaxis,D,"Oculogyric crisis is an acute dystonic reaction of the face/eyes and is usually a consequence of typical neuroleptic drugs such as haloperidol or chlorpromazine, but is unusual with newer agents such as olanzapine or clozapine. The condition is often precipitated by re-introduction of the agent. The condition should be treated with procyclidine (usually IV or IM) or benztropine. Chronic treatment beyond a couple of days is not required. "
urinary system,175,"A 54-year-old woman presents for the third time in six months with a urinary tract infection and left loin pain. On each occasion Proteus has been identified. She is successfully treated for this episode with a one week course of trimethoprim, and a KUB is reported as showing a left staghorn calculus. Which of the following is the most likely chemical composition of the staghorn calculus?",Ammonium magnesium phosphate,Calcium oxalate,Calcium phosphate,Calcium urate,Cystine,A,"The correct answer is ammonium magnesium phosphate (struvite). Struvite stones are associated with Proteus infection because Proteus creates a situation where ammonia and urine pH are both increased, leading to ideal conditions for stone formation. Urease inhibitors have been used as medical therapy to reduce stone formation in conjunction with antibiotic therapy for underlying Proteus, although surgical stone removal may be required. Cystine stones are associated with cystinuria, urate stones with gout, and oxalate stones are associated with short bowel syndrome. Calcium phosphate stones are seen in renal tubular acidosis."

Which should be considered for neurosurgical intervention?,A 50-year-old patient with infarction of 60% of the MCA territory,A 55-year-old patient with a cerebellar infarction but no hydrocephalus,A 59-year-old patient presenting with ataxia who has a small pontine infarction,A 64-year-old patient with infarction of 80% of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory,Neurosurgery is not indicated in ischaemic stroke,A,"Current clinical guidelines recommend that patients who are under 60 years of age with large cerebral infarctions arising in the MCA territory should be considered for decompressive hemicraniectomy. Eligibility is based on  Clinical and radiological evidence of a stroke affecting this territory, Radiological evidence that more than 50% or 145 cm^3 of the MCA territory is involved and Being classified as having a moderate to severe stroke according to the National Institute of Health stroke scale.  Decompressive hemicraniectomy involves removing part of the skull in order to reduce intracranial pressure and should be carried out within 48 hours of the index event. The other indications for neurosurgical intervention to be considered in acute ischaemic stroke are a massive cerebellar infarction or evidence of hydrocephalus or brainstem compression."
urinary system,177,"A 31-year-old nurse presents with chronic pain. The pain changes from day to day, but often focuses in the lower back. She is pale and looks unwell. She complains of waking up frequently at night, and feels unrefreshed in the morning. She also complains of intermittent constipation and diarrhoea. Examination is essentially normal - but the patient complains of tenderness in multiple areas on palpation. Basic blood tests are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Depressive disorder,Fibromyalgia,Hypothyroidism,Schizophrenia,Somatoform disorder,B,"Fibromyalgia is becoming a recognised medical diagnosis, and is based on the presence of pain in all four quadrants of the body, as well as tenderness in 11 of 18 anatomically defined trigger areas. The aetiology is not fully understood, but may involve hyperexcitability within the spinal cord or brainstem, altered pain perception and somatisation. Approximately 50% of patients with fibromyalgia complain of diarrhoea and constipation, often associated with abdominal bloating. Morning fatigue is present in a large proportion of these patients, and patients often look unwell, and may appear depressed and anxious. Other features include tissue swelling, morning stiffness and sleep disorders. Somatoform disorders are a group of psychological disorders in which a patient experiences physical symptoms despite the absence of an underlying medical condition that can fully explain their presence. The clinical picture here is too close to that of fibromyalgia to be a somatoform disorder. Depression should be a diagnosis of exclusion, and fibromyalgia is a more likely diagnosis here. If the patient had hypothyroidism you would expect other features in the history, such as cold intolerance. Schizophrenia would not explain the clinical findings in this case."

She has been woken on numerous occasions by her legs which are irritable and feel that they are being tugged. She needs to keep moving them. This urge lasts variable periods and she finds little relief from rubbing the legs. No abnormalities are noted on examination of her legs. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?,Amitriptyline,Gabapentin,Psychiatric referral,Ropinirole,Venlafaxine,D,"This patient has features of restless legs syndrome. Typically there is an uncomfortable sensation in the legs and a feeling of needing to move them. The exact aetiology is unknown. Although no specific tests exist for the diagnosis it is based on the international restless legs syndrome study group four basic criteria for diagnosing RLS:  A desire to move the limbs, often associated with paraesthesias or dysaesthesias Symptoms that are worse or present only during rest and are partially or temporarily relieved by activity Motor restlessness, and Nocturnal worsening of symptoms.  Treatment depends on the severity of the problem and the most appropriate treatment here would be ropinirole, which is the one agent,in the options, licensed for this purpose. Pramipexole and rotigotine are also licensed for moderate to severe restless legs."
urinary system,180,"A 28-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining that her right pupil is much larger than the other. She says that she first noticed this a few weeks ago after suffering from an attack of shingles. On examination the pupil is larger than the other, reacts poorly to light, but appears to have a normal near reflex. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Argyll-Robertson pupil,Holmes-Adie pupil,Horner's syndrome,Normal variant,Third nerve palsy,B,"The Holmes-Adie pupil usually occurs after a herpes zoster infection, which initially leads to an abnormally large pupil poorly reactive to light with a normal near reflex. Over years it gradually diminishes in size actually to be smaller than the non-affected pupil. The diagnosis is supported by an abnormally vigorous reaction to weak pupil constricting eye drops, which can be compared to the changes seen on the normal side."

On physical examination, pulse rate was 60/minute and blood pressure was 145/83 mmHg. Fundi and cardiac examinations were normal. There was no pedal oedema. Urine protein measured 0.7 g daily. Her serum creatinine level was 60 μmol/L. Medications at that time were lisinopril and folic acid. Which of the following recommendations is most appropriate?",Continue the folic acid and lisinopril,"Continue the folic acid and lisinopril, but advise to stop lisinopril in the second half of pregnancy",Change lisinopril to losartan,Stop lisinopril,Target blood pressure of less than 120/80 mmHg during pregnancy,D,"Both ACE inhibitor and angiotensin-receptor blocker are contraindicated in pregnancy. The use of ACE inhibitor during the second half of the pregnancy (the second option) has been well known to be associated with oligohydramnios (probably resulting from impaired fetal renal function) and neonatal anuria, and fetal death. Although the old teaching might allow the use of lisinopril during the first trimester, an observational retrospective cohort study that included women with exposure to ACE inhibitors in the first trimester, as reported in 2006, raised the issue that the drug is associated with increased odds for cardiovascular defects and central nervous system defects. By extrapolation, other blockers of renin-angiotensin system should also be switched to other class of antihypertensive drugs (before conception, if possible). In other words, the second and third options are not appropriate. Blood pressure goal during pregnancy, in general, is less aggressive (the fifth answer option); a very tight blood pressure control is linked with an increased risk of fetal growth restriction. Pre-pregnancy doses of antihypertensive medications are not infrequently reduced, particularly in the second trimester."

Whilst the first three antibodies may be positive in patients with lupus, the C3 complement component is consumed during an acute attack and is, therefore, the best marker of disease activity. In this situation, where significant renal impairment is already noted, steroids and cyclophosphamide in combination are the treatment of choice."
urinary system,186,Which of the following criteria fit with a diagnosis of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)?,Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Serum hyperosmolality,Urine osmolality greater than 100milliosmoles/kg,Urine sodium less than 20mmol/litre,D,"SIADH results in excess ADH production with subsequent excess water reabsorption at the distal tubules. The resulting picture is one of dilute serum and concentrated urine. It is characterised by the following essential criteria:  normal renal, adrenal and thyroid function no recent use of diuretics clinical euvolaemia decreased serum osmolality (less than 275 milliosmoles/kg of water) increased urine osmolality (more than 100 milliosmoles/kg of water) in the context of hypotonic serum.  Hypernatraemia does not fit as the patient should be hyponatraemic in SIADH. The serum potassium level is typically within normal limits.  Urine sodium less than 20 mmol/litre suggests a dilute rather than concentrated urine. The urine sodium is typically greater than20 mmol/litre in SIADH.  "
urinary system,187,A 56 year old male with known peripheral vascular disease and ischaemic heart disease is currently on amlodipine and bendroflumethiazide for blood pressure control. On his last few blood pressure checks he has been found to be hypertensive. He is therefore commenced on ramipril. He had his bloods checked one week later and was found to be in acute renal failure. What is the most likely cause?,Hypovolaemia,Glomerulonephritis,Hypotensive damage,Cardiac failure,Renal artery stenosis,E,This patient is an arteriopath and therefore renal artery stenosis is the most likely cause. When ACE inhibitors are introduced to patients with renal artery stenosis there is an acute renal impairment due to alteration of the constriction of the efferent artery and deterioration of blood flow.
urinary system,188,"A 69-year-old male presents with sudden onset weakness of his legs associated with urinary retention. Five years previously he was diagnosed with sigmoid colonic carcinoma which was surgically resected. Examination revealed a flaccid paraparesis of the legs with absent tendon reflexes and plantar responses. Pinprick and temperature sensations were absent to T12 level, but there was a relative sparing of light touch and joint position sensation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anterior spinal artery occlusion,Intramedullary spinal cord metastasis,Spinal cord compression due to vertebral metastasis,T11/12 central disc prolapse,Transverse myelitis,A,"The lesion is involving the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord which spares light touch, vibration and position sense, but causes loss of pain and temperature sensation distally. The diagnostic possibilities therefore include anterior spinal artery occlusion, which is rare, and intramedullary spinal cord metastasis. The condition has developed quite suddenly, which is the key and supports a vascular event. Intramedullary spinal cord lesions are also rare, and vertebral metastasis causing cord compression occurs more commonly; however the clinical signs suggest sparing of the dorsal columns."

It can hyperpolarise cells by increasing K^+ conductance and inhibit Ca^2+ channels in others by inhibting GABA-B receptors. Rhabdomyolysis is caused by:  Clofibrate Aminocaproic acid HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors Neuroleptics (neuroleptic malignant syndrome).  Avoid abrupt withdrawal as it can cause serious side-effects including autonomic dysreflexia.
urinary system,191,Which of the following is true regarding benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)?,Can be treated with 5-alpha-reductase-inhibitors,Causes a normal serum PSA,Incidence is increased in males castrated before puberty,Mainly affects the peripheral zone,Symptoms improve with oxybutynin,A,BPH mainly affects the inner transitional zone. The outer peripheral zone is usually compressed and feels smooth to digital rectal examination. Any palpable nodule or irregularity should raise the possibility of malignancy. BPH seems to be an androgen-driven disease: castration prior to puberty seems to prevent the disease. The first line treatment is an alpha-blocker. These cause relaxation of smooth muscles and improve symptoms. Anticholinergic drugs could worsen symptoms and may precipitate acute urinary retention. 5-alpha-reductase drugs (antiandrogens) may improve symptoms and reduce the size of the prostate. These may be recommended for patients with prostates estimated as larger than 30g.

urinary system,193,"A 50-year-old man presents with tingling in the left upper limb. The pain originated in the neck and radiated down the left arm. He proceeded to have numbness and paraesthesia in the left lower limb. On examination he had restriction of neck movements and there was a mild wasting to be noted in the left biceps. There was inversion of the supinator and biceps jerks. His knee jerk and ankle jerk were hyperreactive and he has a positive extensor plantar response. He then developed paraesthesia and numbness of the right lower limb. A diagnosis of cord compression was made and he underwent a surgical decompression. Post-surgery was complicated by septicaemia and urinary tract infection and he remained in bed for four days. He subsequently developed inability to dorsiflex his right foot and right big toe. There was numbness on the outside of the foot and there was decreased eversion, but inversion was normal. His reflexes remained as before. What is the cause of the post operative weakness?",Common peroneal nerve palsy,L4 root lesion,Recurrence of the original cord compression,Sciatic nerve palsy,Spinal cord infarction,A,"The commonest cause of acute foot drop after prolonged bed rest is entrapment common peroneal neuropathy at the neck of fibula. Whilst it is possible for this to develop at the time of surgery, the complicated postoperative course in this gentleman is likely to have contributed. Typically there is weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, eversion, diminished sensation of the lateral aspect of leg and dorsum of foot. The ankle reflex remains intact."

Which one of the following is most likely to preserve renal function?",Dietary salt restriction,Low dietary protein intake,Ramipril,Simvastatin,Warfarin,C,Approximately 50% of subjects with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) do not respond to steroid therapy but angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are a recognised strategy to slow the progression of renal disease. This patient is clearly at high risk of cardiovascular disease with a very high cholesterol but the question specifically asks about renal disease.
urinary system,195,"A 67-year-old man is admitted to the Emergency department with drooling, tongue and lip swelling and tachypnoea. He has COPD, angina, diabetes and hypertension. He was at home when the incident occurred, and had not recently been in contact with anything new. He has no known allergies and his medication has not changed in the past year. What is the likely cause of his symptoms?",Aspirin,Diltiazem,Enalapril,Food allergy,Tetanus,C,"This gentleman has angioedema. This is a side effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) and to a lesser extent angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB). It does not necessarily occur as soon as the medication is started. There is nothing pointing towards it being a food or drug allergy as he has not done anything different from normal. Tetanus results in lock jaw and there is usually a history of injury.  The commoner side effects of diltiazem are leg swelling, bradycardia, AV node block and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbance. The commoner side effects of aspirin are reflux or acid symptoms, with the possibility of GI bleed."
urinary system,196,A 23-year-old man presents with visual loss in his right eye and this is diagnosed as optic neuritis. Which one of the following statements would be seen in an afferent pupillary defect?,Accommodation response is unaffected,Hypersensitive response to pilocarpine in the affected eye,Irregular pupil of the affected eye,Pupil of affected eye larger than the unaffected eye,Pupil of affected eye smaller than the unaffected eye,A,Optic neuropathy does not cause any abnormalities of the shape or size of the pupil. However the light reaction is diminished. Accommodation is normal.

Which of the following drugs might be responsible?",Ipatroprium bromide inhaler,Montelukast,Serevent inhaler,Sodium chromoglycate,Theophylline,A,"Ipatropium bromide acts as an antimuscarinic bronchodilator and has traditionally been regarded as more effective in relieving bronchoconstriction associated with chronic bronchitis. Side effects are rare and it does not increase sputum viscosity or affect the mucociliary clearance of sputum. Reported side effects are dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation and urinary retention. The nebulised drug has occasionally been reported to leak around the mask and precipitate acute angle closure glaucoma in susceptible patients. "

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Carcinomatosis meningitis ,Cryptococcal meningitis ,Listeria meningitis,Meningococcal meningitis ,Tuberculus meningitis ,C,"Risk factors for listeria meningitis include older age and immunosuppresion. It is typically associated with brain stem signs. Cerebrospinal fluid shows:  Neutrophilic pleocytosis Low glucose, and High protein."
urinary system,199,A 32-year-old shop worker presents with a 24 hour history of weakness in the hands. She also complains of shortness of breath. The oxygen saturations are 90% on air. The biceps and triceps reflexes are absent in the left arm and reduced in the right arm. Which of the following are recognised treatments of this acute presentation?,Edrophonium,G-CSF,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,Physiotherapy,Plasmapheresis,E,"This young woman has features suggestive of Guillan-Barré syndrome. Classically muscular weakness usually begins in the leg, and ascends to involve the trunk, arms and cranial nerves. However, increasingly clinical variants are being recognised in which weakness initially begins in other areas, including the hands. Early initiation of immunosuppressive treatment has been shown to lead to a good prognosis in these cases. One important consideration is the monitoring of vital capacity and appropriate management in an environment where intubation can be undertaken rapidly. Specific therapy which can be initiated are plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. In UK clinical practice, IVIG is used more frequently as it is easier to administrate. Corticosteroids have been linked with worsening of symptoms. Passive physiotherapy is critical whilst weakness persists, progressing to active exercise when the weakness begins to resolve. However, this does not have an effect on the course of disease. There is no evidence for the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. G-CSF is used in neutropenia. Edrophonium is a reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, which can be used to diagnose myasthenia gravis (although this is rarely done in clinical practice). "
urinary system,200,A 71-year-old woman consults you. She has recently been started on an antihypertensive but she has noticed a dry mouth and dizziness on standing. Which medication is it likely to be?,Doxazosin,Enalapril,Isosorbide mononitrate,Nicardipine,Olmesartan medoxomil,A,"Doxazosin is an alpha-adrenoceptor blocker. It can cause rapid reduction in BP and therefore requires gradual introduction and up-titration. Its side effects include dry mouth, syncope, drowsiness, oedema, and gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances. Enalapril and other angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors most commonly cause a dry cough and postural hypotension. They can also cause angioedema and hyperkalaemia. The nitrate class of drugs commonly causes headache and dizziness. Nicardipine and other calcium channel blockers may cause peripheral oedema, headache, flushing, and palpitations. Olmesartan, an angiotensin 2 blocker, has a similar side effect profile to ACEi except usually milder and does not cause a dry cough, as it does not affect bradykinin synthesis."
urinary system,201,"A 19-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with tea-coloured urine two weeks after the onset of an episode of streptococcal tonsillitis for which he received a course of Penicillin V. He has also noticed puffiness around his eyes which has developed over the past 24 hours. There is no past medical history of note and he takes no regular medications. BP is 148/85, pulse is 80 and regular. You confirm periorbital oedema on examination. Urine dip which is positive for both blood and protein. Serum creatinine is 85 micromol/l, (60-110). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute interstitial nephritis,IgA nephropathy,Membranous nephropathy,Minimal change disease,Post streptococcal glomerulonephritis,E,"The answer is post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (diffuse proliferative glomerulonephritis). The time period (1-2 weeks after the acute infection), is classical, as is the presentation with discoloured urine and periorbital oedema. Hypertension is seen in 60% or more of cases, although it is usually transient and resolves on normalisation of plasma volume. Treatment is primarily supportive, although some adults may be left with some long-term renal impairment. Acute interstitial nephritis as a result of penicillins starts 2 - 60 days after therapy is initiated and is associated with a fever and maculopapular rash, as well as haematuria. It would definitely be a possibility in this case, however, you would expect more significant renal impairment than is seen here. IgA nephropathy presents more quickly after respiratory tract infection, (24 - 48 hours) usually with haematuria. Membranous disease presents with nephrotic syndrome and predominantly proteinuria, minimal change disease is more likely to present with repeated episodes of nephrotic range proteinuria in childhood and teenage years."
urinary system,202,"A 30-year-old woman complains of daily frontal headaches for the preceding year. They occur at various times of the day and are worse with stress. On examination, the left pupil is 2 mm larger than the right. It is reactive to accommodation but not to light. Which of the following features would be inconsistent with the diagnosis?",Absent biceps jerk,Exaggerated response to dilute pilocarpine drops instilled in the left eye,Fine hand tremor,Ptosis,Resolution of anisocoria with time,D,This patient has an Adie pupil which happens to coexist with tension headache. An absent biceps jerk would be consistent with Holmes-Adie syndrome. The characteristic abnormality in this condition is degeneration of parasympathetic nerves in the cilliary ganglion which leads to denervation of the pupil and hence hypersensitvity to dilute pilocarpine drops. The affected pupil is usually larger than the other but may constrict with time. The cause of the associated arreflexia is unknown. A fine hand tremor may accompany anxiety states associated with tension headache but ptosis requires an organic explanation.
urinary system,203,An old man presents to his GP with difficulty driving. He reports not seeing cars approaching from the right. On examination he has a right inferior homonymous quadrantanopia. Where is the lesion most likely to be?,Left optic tract,Left parietal lobe,Optic chiasm,Right occipital lobe,Right temporal lobe,B,"Lesions affecting the optic radiation cause a contralateral homonymous quadrantanopia. The upper part of the visual field flows through the temporal lobe, whilst the inferior part flows through the parietal lobe. This can be remembered with the mnemonic, PITS: Parietal Inferior, Temporal Superior. Lesions of the optic tract (before the lateral geniculate body) result in a contralateral homonymous hemianopia, whilst lesions of the optic chiasm cause a bitemporal hemianopia. Left optic tract is incorrect because optic tract lesions cause hemianopsia. Right occipital lobe is incorrect because it is ipsilateral and would cause a hemianopia. Right temporal lobe is incorrect because it is ipsilateral and would cause a superior quadrantanopia. Optic chiasm is incorrect because optic chiasm lesions cause bitemporal hemianopsia."
urinary system,204,"A 24-year-old man presents with proteinuria, haematuria, and sensorineural deafness. Which of the following protein structures is likely to be abnormal?",Fibrillin,Laminin,Type 1 collagen,Type 3 collagen,Type 4 collagen,E,"The diagnosis is Alport's syndrome, which is a disorder of type 4 collagen assembly and is inherited as an X-linked disorder in 85% of cases. Fibrillin gene abnormalities are associated with Marfan's syndrome. Type 1 collagen disorders are associated with osteogenesis imperfecta; it is the main type of collagen in tendon and bone.

This allows determination of the exact level and position of the fistula with relation to the ureteric orifices and bladder neck. This will be important in determining the appropriate surgical technique and the likelihood of subsequent urethral Incompetence. The condition of the tissues must be carefully assessed, as the persistence of slough should deter definitive repair surgery. Malignant change has been reported in long-standing benign fistulae thus, if there is any doubt about the nature of the tissue, biopsy should be undertaken."

urinary system,211,"A 45-year-old man with chronic renal failure presents to clinic complaining of increasing fatigue and weakness. He receives three hours of haemodialysis, thrice weekly. His blood pressure is measured at 176/110 mmHg pre-dialysis and 166/95 mmHg post-dialysis. Investigations pre-dialysis show:    Hb 95 g/L (130-180)   Potassium 6.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Creatinine 1567 µmol/L (60-110)   Corrected Calcium 2.1 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)    Which of the following options is most appropriate initial management for this patient?",Give alfacalcidol to correct hypocalcaemia,Increase the duration of each dialysis session,Reduce the potassium concentration in the dialysate,Start erythropoietin to increase haemoglobin level,Start ramipril to gain better control of his blood pressure,B,"Haemodialysis (HD) is a complex area and one which does not need to be completely understood by a general physician, or one early in the stages of training. This question deals with the complex concept of dialysis adequacy. The prime aim of long-term haemodialysis is to remove nitrogenous metabolic end-products, remove fluid and maintain electrolyte, fluid and acid-base equilibrium. Although toxin removal is critical, the removal of any particular toxin is a poor measure of haemodialysis adequacy because the removal rate depends on the pre-dialysis serum concentration. 'Clearance' is therefore used to indicate dialysis adequacy, and most commonly the clearance of urea is used. Clearance is the ratio of removal rate to blood concentration. Removal rate can be measured instantaneously by sampling blood on either side of the dialyser and multiplying the difference by the inflow rate. Clearance is the removal rate divided by the inflow concentration. However, this only provides a measure of dialysis at one point in time. The adequacy of an entire haemodialysis session is best measured by the fall in solute concentration from before dialysis to after. This is calculated using complex equations and is expressed as Kt/V. The current recommendation for adequate dialysis for three treatments per week are a Kt/V of 1.2. The details are not needed for MRCP but are described in the references below for those who are interested. A more crude assessment of the adequacy of dialysis can be obtained by noting the magnitude of the decrease in blood urea concentration (the 'urea reduction ratio'). In addition to assessing the reduction in urea, it is standard practice in the UK to take biochemical and haematological measurements before and after haemodialysis sessions at regular intervals (monthly in hospital HD patients and at least 3 monthly in-home HD patients). Adequate HD is indicated by pre-dialysis serum bicarbonate levels of 18-24 mmol/L, potassium 4.0-6.0 mmol/L, phosphate 1.1-1.7 mmol/L, and calcium and albumin within normal range. It is also recommended that pre-dialysis haemoglobin concentration should be maintained between 100-120 g/L. Cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain very high in haemodialysis. Control of blood pressure is central to this, and improving adequacy of dialysis has proven value in overcoming this. Blood pressure varies significantly in HD patients depending on the time taken: pre-dialysis, post-dialysis or inter-dialysis. There is a lack of evidence regarding which value correlates best with long-term outcome. Hypertension pre-dialysis can be used a surrogate marker for inadequate ultrafiltration during haemodialysis. Available evidence indicates that control of a patient's fluid volume influences cardiovascular outcome. Volume and blood pressure are linked and it is, therefore, important to optimise ultrafiltration and dry weight to control blood pressure. All efforts should be taken to ensure haemodialysis patients are euvolaemic and normotensive, which include counselling on sodium and fluid restriction, adequate ultrafiltration and the use of medication. A high pre-dialysis or inter-dialysis blood pressure may be related to excessive sodium and water ingestion during the inter-dialysis period or a high dialysate sodium level, whereas a high post-dialysis blood pressure may reflect inadequate achievement of dry weight. Weight gain between dialyses of more than 4.8% is associated with increased mortality. The combination of high pre- and post-dialysis blood pressure, and high pre-dialysis potassium indicate that this patient is receiving inadequate dialysis. Both procedural issues (insufficient blood flow rate, dialysis time and frequency and needle size) and access issues should be addressed. If these fail to improve the situation a different dialysis modality should be considered, such as more frequent or sustained haemodialysis. From the available options, increasing the duration of the dialysis session should be done initially. His haemoglobin is also below the recommended level for a dialysis patient but you need to measure haematinics prior rather than jumping in with EPO treatment. Many haemodialysis patients are iron deplete, and in these cases, intravenous iron is indicated rather than EPO in the first instance. Anti-hypertensive medication can be considered if adequate ultrafiltration fails to control this patient's blood pressure. "

The most common features include ptosis, diplopia and ophthalmoplegia. It is a neuromuscular disorder and therefore does not cause any lower motor neuron signs such as fasciculations, wasting, and loss of reflexes. Pupils are always normal. Lid lag is a feature of thyroid eye disease."
urinary system,213,Mutation in which of the following is associated with Alport syndrome?,Collagen type I gene,"Collagen, type IV, alpha 5 gene",Fibrillin-1 gene,FMR-1 gene,Type II procollagen gene,B,"Mutations in the COL4A5 gene cause approximately 80% of Alport syndrome cases. Several hundred different mutations have been identified, the majority of which cause a change in the sequence of amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) in a region of the alpha5(IV) collagen chain that is critical for combining with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations severely decrease or prevent the production of the alpha5(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. Collagen type I gene defects lead to osteogeneis imperfecta. Fibrillin-1 defects lead to Marfan's syndrome. FMR-1 gene defects lead to fragile X syndrome. Type II procollagen defects lead to spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia."

HIV screen is negative. She has no history of drug or alcohol abuse. Pregnancy test was negative. Which of the following laboratory tests should be ordered based on the history?",Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies,Gamma-glutamyltransferase,Peripheral/blood smear,Prealbumin,Thyroglobulin level,A,"This is a case of Hashimoto's encephalopathy which is extremely rare. You should suspect this as TSH derangement however there may be no clinical evidence of thyroid dysfunction. It is a steroid responsive encephalopathy and can result in altered mental state, myoclonus and ataxia. Gamma-glutamyltransferase would not change the management as the drug screen was negative and liver function tests are normal. Prealbumin is a marker of nutritional status but would not be important at this time, and albumin was reported normal. Thyroglobulin levels would not change management; however antibodies to thyroglobulin can be present in Hashimoto's encephalopathy. Peripheral or blood smear may be chosen because of the anaemia however given this is a normocytic normochromic anaemia it is likely the result of iron loss through menstruation."

Hyperparathyroidism and renal tubular acidosis can lead to calcium phosphate deposition. The next common stone composition is Ammonium magnesium phosphate / struvite stones, accounting for 10 to 15%. These are formed in the presence of Proteus which are urease producing bacteria leading to ammonia and carbon dioxide production, alkalinising the urine. This allows precipitation of organic and inorganic salts. Uric acid stones account for 5 to 10% and are found in conditions which have a high uric acid in serum or urine. Cysteine stones are rare and are due to an inborn error of metabolism."

He is on a number of medications which include simvastatin and warfarin. Whilst you are assessing him in Accident and Emergency he suffers a second generalised tonic-clonic seizure. What anti-epileptic should he be started on after management of the acute episode?",Carbamezapine,Clonazepam,Gabapentin,Lamotrigine,Sodium valproate,D,"Up to 10% of patients who have stroke are thought to subsequently develop seizures. These are classically focal initially and then develop secondary generalisation. There is a lack of high-quality evidence regarding the relative effectiveness of the different anti-seizure medications in this setting. Some studies suggest that the newer agents have similar efficacy to traditional treatments, with a more favourable adverse event profile in older patients. Both lamotrigine and gabapentin have been showed to be beneficial in this setting, but lamotrigine is preferred in the current NICE guidelines. Sodium valproate, which is a first-line treatment for tonic-clonic epilepsy in adults, is a potent cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibitor which is therefore contraindicated due to the patient being on warfarin. Carbamazepine is also contraindicated, as it is a P450 inducer. Clonazepam is more often used in the management of myoclonic epilepsy, rather than in the post-stroke setting. "

Given the likely diagnosis, what is the likely pathological process?",Mesangial proliferation with prominent IgA deposition,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Complement deposition,Deposition along basement membrane of immunoglobulins and complement,Loss of podocytes,A,"The most likely diagnosis here is IgA nephropathy or Buergers disease which most often presents as frank haematuria associated with URTI but also gastroenteritis, UTIs and pneumonia. There can be persistence f microscopic haematuria and it is the most common cause of isolated persistent microscopic haematuria. Immune complexes of IgA become lodged in glomeruli and there is complement fixation. This leads to mesangial proliferation with prominent IgA deposition predominantly. Hypertension can occur and this requires early treatment with ACE inhibitors being the treatment of choice and are thought to reduce proteinuria even if the patient is normotensive. Corticosteroids are given if there is evidence of nephrotic syndrome and in those with proliferative IgA nephropathy ad moderate proteinuria it can slow deterioration of renal function. Cyclophosphamide may also be useful. Chronic renal failure and end stage renal failure can develop in approximately 20 to 40%."
urinary system,226,A 60-year-old man awakens with painless loss of vision of his left eye. Three years earlier he had suffered a similar episode involving the right eye. Visual loss in that eye has been stationary. He does not complain of any systemic symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute angle-closure glaucoma,Arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy,Compressive optic neuropathy,Nonarteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy,Optic neuritis,D,"Sudden onset of painless monocular visual loss in patients aged 50 or more is commonly due to ischaemic optic neuropathy. Commonly the symptoms are first noticed upon awakening in the morning. The other eye may suffer a similar event within five years. There are no systemic features (weight loss, lethargy, malaise, jaw claudication, scalp tenderness) to suggest arteritic ischaemic optic neuropathy (giant cell arteritis). In giant cell arteritis, the other eye is usually affected within four weeks. Optic neuritis is unlikely in a man of this age who had painless loss of vision. In older persons it is due to ischemia, which can be arteritic or non-arteritic. Non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy based on cardiovascular risk factors essentially. Arteritic AION is concern with temporal arteritis which has a typical prodrome of jaw claudication, scalp tenderness and headaches"
urinary system,227,"Patients with end stage renal failure on haemodialysis may have anaemia secondary to multiple causes. One important cause is erythropoietin (EPO) deficiency. EPO injections can be given intravenously or subcutaneously and are effective, providing that iron stores are replete. Which of the following blood tests in conjunction with serum ferritin is the recommended test for iron status in patients with anaemia?",C reactive protein (CRP),Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),Mean cell volume,Serum iron,Transferrin saturation,E,"A transferrin saturation less than 20% is used in conjunction with serum ferritin to assess need for iron replacement in the management of anaemia in chronic kidney disease. According to NICE guidelines, ferritin in conjunction with either transferrin saturation or percentage hypochromic red cells is used to assess anaemia. Low mean cell volume can be indicative of iron deficiency but may also be attributable to other causes and so this is incorrect. Serum iron, although a marker of iron status is not a recommended test, is incorrect. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are inflammatory markers and have no bearing on the management of iron status in anaemia in chronic kidney disease. Hence these options are incorrect. "
urinary system,228,Indications for circumcision include which of the following?,Enuresis,Non-retractile prepuce in a 3-month-old baby,Phimosis,Scrotal thrush,Severe ammonia dermatitis,C,The one absolute indication for circumcision is scarring of the opening of the foreskin making it non-retractable (pathological phimosis). This is unusual before the age of 5. Recurrent troublesome episodes of infection beneath the foreskin (balanoposthitis) are an occasional indication for circumcision. Occasionally paediatric circumcisions are required for rare conditions.
urinary system,229,A 55-year-old man has progressive weakness of his hands over a period of one year. Examination reveals wasting of the muscles of the hands and forearms and fasciculation. There is hyperreflexia of his lower limbs and upgoing plantars. Sensation is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Alzheimer's disease,Motor neurone disease,Multiple cerebral infarcts,Multiple sclerosis,Syringomyelia,B,There is a mixture of lower motor neurone signs in the upper arms and upper motor neurone signs in the legs. Cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimerandamp;#39;s disease are therefore unlikely.The history is of gradual onset over one year which makes multiple sclerosis less likely since it is usually abrupt in the onset of symptoms.Syringomyelia is unlikely since sensation is unaffected.This leaves motor neurone disease particularly of the amytrophic lateral sclerosis type.
urinary system,230,A 50-year-old lady suffers with migraine. She smokes 20 cigarettes a day. She has found that paracetamol 1 g was not always effective in relieving her pain. Which of the following factors is the most likely to account for this problem?,Altered volume of distribution,Delayed gastric emptying,First pass metabolism,Hepatic enzyme induction,Reduced gut blood flow,B,"Paracetamol absorption is reduced during migraine attacks and reduced absorption is associated with increased nausea. There is evidence that delayed gastric emptying is to blame^1. In fact the paracetamol absorption technique is used to study gastric emptying^2. Enzyme induction with cigarette smoking does affect paracetamol metabolism. Its importance however, is in toxicity. Smokers would be classified as in a high risk for paracetamol overdose and are assessed using a different time - paracetamol level curve. "
urinary system,231,Causes of dilated pupils include which of the following?,Argyll Robertson pupil,Ethylene glycol poisoning,Myotonic dystrophy,Organophosphate poisoning,Pontine haemorrhage,B,"Causes of dilated pupils include:  Holmes-Adie (myotonic) pupil Third nerve palsy, and Drugs and poisons (atropine, CO, ethylene glycol).  Causes of small pupils include:  Horner's syndrome Old age Pontine haemorrhage Argyll Robertson pupil, and Drugs and poisons (opiates, organophosphates)."
urinary system,232,An 18-year-old man presents to his GP with thirst and polyuria. Some 6 months ago he had a significant head injury as the result of a RTA. He is referred to the local endocrine clinic. Which of the following results would be the most useful in confirming the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus after a water deprivation test (without additional desmopressin)?,Plasma sodium of 126mmol/l,Plasma sodium of 150mmol/l,Plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 700mosmol/kg,Plasma osmolality of 280mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 700mosmol/kg,Plasma osmolality of 335mosmol/kg and urine osmolality of 200mosmol/kg,E,In DI plasma osmolality will be high due to excess fluid loss with urine and urine osmolality will be low due to polyuria. Hence E. is the best option here(normal plasma osmolality 275-295 mosmol/kg and normal urine osmolality is 300-900 mosmol/kg)
urinary system,233,Which of the following lifestyle characteristics is associated with IgA nephropathy?,Alcohol excess,Cocaine use,High cholesterol,Obesity,Red meat intake,A,"IgA nephropathy is associated with a host of medical conditions. Heavy alcohol use in the past is also associated with the disease. There is no known significant association with cocaine use, high cholesterol, obesity or red meat intake. These answers are therefore incorrect. "
urinary system,234,A 60-year-old male is referred with episodes of severe vertigo which may last up to four hours and are associated with vomiting and uncomfortable pressure in the right ear. On examination during an attack he is noted to have right horizontal nystagmus together with mild right-sided sensorineural deafness. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Acoustic neuroma,Benign positional vertigo,Labyrinthitis,Ménière's disease,Vertebrobasilar ischaemic attacks,D,"This is a typical history of Ménière's disease. The attacks are paroxysmal, last for hours and consist of:  Vertigo Vomiting Pressure within the ear, and Deafness.  After many attacks the patient may develop irreversible sensorineural deafness (of low frequency).Tinnitus is present ,often, but may not occur in the early stages,so the classic triad ,of tinnitus vertigo and deafness isn't always diagnostically reliable. Prochlorperazine or cinnarizine usually helps vomiting, and restriction of salt and fluid may hasten resolution. Occasionally diuretics may be used but there is little evidence for efficacy. Vertigo is uncommonly associated with unilateral hearing loss caused by acoustic neuroma. In benign positional vertigo the episodes of vertigo last seconds and are precipitated by movement. Labyrinthitis is characterised by acute disabling vertigo, usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection and is very rarely episodic. Vertebrobasilar ischaemic attacks last minutes and typically the vertigo is a mild swaying or swimming sensation. "
urinary system,235,"A 50-year-old male epileptic presents with paraesthesia of hands and feet. He also has unsteadiness when walking. On examination he has Dupuytren's contracture in his left hand, a peripheral sensory neuropathy and palpable lymph nodes in his neck and axillae. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of these features?",Carbamazepine,Clonazepam ,Lamotrigine,Phenytoin,Sodium valproate,D,"Phenytoin is well known to cause neurological side effects such as peripheral sensory neuropathy and cerebellar ataxia. Other side effects include:  Gingival hypertrophy Lymphadenopathy Hypocalcaemia, and Hirsutism."
urinary system,236,"A 61 year old male presents with severe lower back pain, lethargy , anorexia and peripheral oedema. He is found to be hypercalcaemic and have renal impairment and nephrotic syndrome. A renal biopsy reveals deposits which after staining with congo red appear as apple green birefringence under polarised light. There is is evidence of a paraprotein band on serum electrophoresis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",AA amyloidosis secondary to multiple myeloma,MGUS,Nephrotic syndrome,Primary amyloidosis,AL amyloidosis secondary to multiple myeloma,E,This patient presents with features of multiple myeloma. This is associated with AL amyloidosis. There is clonal production of light chain either kappa or lambda. AA amyloidosis occurs secondary to chronic inflammatory conditions such as Rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disease. The symptoms are dependent on the organs involved such as cardiomyopathy and heart failure and autonomic and sensory neuropathies such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
urinary system,237,A CT shows blood in the sylvian fissure. In which compartment is this blood?,Epidural,Subarachnoid,Subcortical,Subdural,Subgaleal,B,The subarachnoid space is in between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater. Vascular malformations and aneurysms typically bleed in the subarachnoid space. Subdural refers to the area between the dura and the arachnoid. Epidural is between the skull and the dura. Subgaleal is a potential space between the skull and the scalp aponeurosis. Subcortical is in the white matter of the brain below the cortex.
urinary system,238,A 45-year-old male presents with a longstanding history of hypertension. Investigations show a urea of 10.2 mmol/L (2.5-7.5) and a creatinine of 150 µmol/L (60-110). Which one of the following would suggest a diagnosis of acute glomerulonephritis?,24 hour urinary protein excretion of 0.8 g,Dyslipidaemia,RBC casts in urinary sediment,Shrunken glomeruli on renal biopsy,Bilateral smaller kidneys,C,Casts containing erythrocytes (red cell casts) are an indication of renal bleeding and are typically found when there is acute glomerular inflammation caused by glomerulonephritis or vasculitis. The other answer options are non-specific and do not suggest an acute glomerulonephritis and some of the options more suggestive of chronic renal failure such as smaller kidneys
urinary system,239,A patient is found to have cystine renal stones.  What is the most likely cause of this?,Cystinosis,Calciuria,Cystinuria,Poor water intake,Furosemide abuse,C,"Cystinuria is whereby the glomerulus fails to reabsorb cystine, ornithine, lysine and arginine.  It is an autosomal recessive disorder which leads to kidney stone, pain, haematuria, obstruction and sometimes renal failure.  The renal stones are often multiple or staghorn.  It is important to encourage high fluid intake, over 3 litres per day, dietary restrictions and urinary alkalinisation with potassium citrate may be useful.  IF these measures fail then captopril or penicillamine (reduces cystine excretion) may be utilised.  Cystinosis is a lysosomal disorder and a common cause of Fanconi syndrome."
urinary system,240,A 32-year-old man presented with painless hematuria. He is hypertensive but the rest of the exam is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Polycystic kidneys,Ca bladder,Ca prostate,TTP,HUS,A,"Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a multisystemic and progressive disorder characterized by cyst formation and enlargement in the kidney and other organs (eg, liver, pancreas, spleen). Up to 50% of patients with ADPKD require renal replacement therapy by 60 years of age. In younger cysts may be smaller to palpate. Renal ultrasound is used to diagnose the condition"

urinary system,242,A 49-year-old man is diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. Despite a normal brain MRI he develops progressive truncal ataxia. Which of the following would be most useful in the diagnosis of his condition?,Anti-Purkinje cell antibody levels,Lumbar puncture,Serum calcium,Serum sodium,Visual evoked potentials,A,"Paraneoplastic syndromes are a result of antibody generation from or against malignant cells attacking normal tissue. Examples include antineuronal antibodies (anti-Hu, anti-Yo, anti-Ri ) directed against the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum leading to the cerebellar syndrome described above. The Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a pre-synaptic disorder of auto-antibody IgG directed against the pre-synaptic calcium channel leading to impaired acetylcholine release. Clinically, patients present with muscle weakness that improves with exercise. Symptomatic hyponatraemia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is treated with demeclocycline which induces nephrogenic diabetes insipidus leading to excretion of excess water. Both non-small cell and small cell lung cancers are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes, although they are more common with the latter due to its neuroendocrine cell origin."
urinary system,243,"A 30-year-old female presents to the eye clinic with an acute history of pain and blurring in the right eye. Examination reveals a visual acuity of 6/36 in the right eye but 6/6 in the left eye, a central scotoma in the right eye, with a right swollen optic disc. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cavernous sinus thrombosis ,Compression of the optic nerve ,Glaucoma ,Optic neuritis ,Retinal vein occlusion ,D,"The acute presentation with central scotoma, reduced visual acuity and a swollen optic disc in a young female suggests a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis with an optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is a broad term which can be used to describe inflammation, degeneration or demyelination of the optic nerve. It encompasses a number of conditions, including:  Papillitis (anterior optic neuritis) - the intraocular portion of the nerve is affected, and the optic disc is swollen Retrobular neuritis - the distal portion of the optic nerve is affected, and the disc is therefore not swollen Neuroretinitis - optic disc and adjacent temporal retina are affected.  Also important to note is that the disc changes in papilloedema may closely resemble those of papillitis but visual acuity is markedly reduced in papillitis and not papilloedema."
urinary system,244,A 23-year-old man presents with severe pain in the right flank radiating to his groin. He is rolling about on the floor. An IVU confirms a stone in the ureter which is 8mm in size. Which treatment modality will be most effective?,Fluids and alpha blockers,ESWL (extra shock-wave lithotripsy),CCB (calcium channel blocker),Dormier basket,PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy),B,Though for 8 mm stone we can use medical expulsive therapy but for this patient with agonizing pain “most effective” therapy is ESWL
urinary system,245,An elderly lady presents with confusion. She is apyrexial but complains of dysuria for 2 days duration. What is the definitive diagnostic investigation?,Blood culture,Urine nitrates,CT head,ECG,IVU,B,Dysurea is suggestive of uti. UTI also can lead to confusion. Urine nitrates if positive is diagnostic of UTI
urinary system,246,"A 68-year-old female presents with a four month history of weight loss, headaches and had recently developed double vision. Six years previously she underwent a right mastectomy for breast carcinoma and remains on treatment with tamoxifen. Examination revealed tenderness over the temporal region and a left sixth nerve palsy. Her chest x ray was reported as normal, but she had an ESR of 100 mm/hr (0-30) and her Hb was 108 g/L (115-165). Which of the following statements is correct?",An isotope bone scan should be performed,An urgent MRI brain scan is required,She should be given diamorphine,She should be treated with prednisolone immediately,She should have a lumbar puncture,D,"Giant cell arteritis is a clinical emergency. High doses of steroids (1 mg/kg) should be initiated as soon as possible to prevent visual loss, which is usually irreversible. Typical clinical features include:  Headache Tender non-pulsatile temporal artery Systemic symptoms of lethargy, weight loss, pyrexia, jaw claudication, visual loss and diplopia (various ophthalmoplegiasare recognised in association with GCA^1).  It is also associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Sometimes the vignette will give you too many details. Your task is to decide what is important. For example breast ca. could raise the ESR and therefore put you off the idea that this is TA. The point is to realise that this is an important consideration not to miss as otherwise the patient could go blind and should be given steroids, followed by biopsy. An urgent Ct not MR should probably be performed but this should not preculde steroids. "
urinary system,247,"A 92-year-old man was admitted in a confused state. He has a history of immobility due to severe lower back pain. He had been losing weight for three months and had complaints of weakness, urinary frequency, thirst, poor urinary stream and constipation. Lumbar spine x rays show severe osteopenia and collapse of the body of the vertebra at L3. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 96 g/L (130-180)   Sodium 144 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 10.4 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 120 μmol/L (60-110)   Glucose 8 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Dipstick urine Blood ++   Protein +    What is the most important immediate investigation?",Chest x ray,MRI whole spine,Prostate specific antigen,Serum calcium,Serum protein electrophoresis,D,"The likely underlying diagnosis is myeloma. The symptoms of constipation, weakness and thirst indicate hypercalcemia. Together with the osteopenia (suggesting lytic lesions) and haematuria and proteinuria (suggesting renal involvement, usually cast nephropathy), this makes myeloma the most likely diagnosis. Serum calcium should be the immediate investigation as treatment to reduce the level is required urgently. This is initially with fluids followed by bisphosphonates, most effectively zoledronic acid. Serum protein electrophoresis will help with making the underlying diagnosis but it is important to treat hypercalcaemia as the most important immediate investigation. Prostate cancer bone metastases are usually sclerotic, making this diagnosis less likely. Haematuria and proteinuria is possible due to inflammation of the prostatic urethra, or invasion of the bladder. MRI whole spine would be beneficial in ensuring that the patient does not have any cord or cauda equina involvement from his spinal lesions, but identification of hypercalcaemia should be done more immediately. Chest x ray is not going to be helpful in the initial management of this patient."
urinary system,248,A 40-year-old man complains of severe colicky loin pain that radiates to his scrotum. He is noted to have microscopic hematuria. No masses are palpated. What is the single most likely cause?,Acute cystitis,Bladder ca,Renal vein thrombosis,Acute pyelonephritis,Ureteric calculus,E,In ureteric stone there is radiation of pain from loin to groin or scrotum. There also occurs hematuria
urinary system,249,A 45 year old male with end stage renal failure requires regular haemodialysis. He is found to be hypocalcaemic. An Xray of his hands reveals loss of cortical outline with fine fraying at the tip of the terminal phalanges. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Osteoporosis,Primary Hyperparathyroidism,Amyloid deposition,Secondary Hyperparathyroidism,Osteopenia,D,"The findings described on Xray are terminal tuft erosions. This patient is likely to have renal osteodystrophy with secondary hyperparathyroidism. In haemodialysis these terminal tuft erosions are an early sign and may precede the findings of other classical findings such as subperiosteal bone resorption in phalanges, characteristically on the radial aspect of the proximal and middle phalanges of the second and third fingers."
urinary system,250,"A 45-year-old woman presented with a severe sudden onset headache, describing it as the worst headache she could imagine, but denying any head trauma. On examination of her cranial nervous system she had a partial ptosis of her right eye, which was unable to look up or medially, and her right pupil was dilated. Her only past medical history is polycystic kidney disease. What is the most likely diagnosis?",First presentation of cluster headache,Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured left sided anterior communicating artery aneurysm,Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured left sided posterior communicating artery aneurysm,Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured right sided anterior communicating artery aneurysm,Subarachnoid haemorrhage caused by a ruptured right sided posterior communicating artery aneurysm,E,"Posterior communicating artery aneurysms can compress the third cranial nerve. If the aneurysm ruptures it can cause the classic picture of an ipsilateral painful third nerve palsy, with the eye down and out, ptosis, and pupil dilation. Cerebral aneurysms may be associated with polycystic kidney disease. It is the ipsilateral posterior communicating artery aneurysm that is compressing the third nerve. Posterior communicating artery aneurysms do not cause contralateral compressive symptoms. Anterior communicating artery aneurysms do not compress the third nerve."
urinary system,251,A 39-year-old man is referred by his optician with a central scotoma found in his right eye during a routine eye test. On examination of his cranial nerves he is poorly compliant and keeps laughing. He says he is unable to smell anything and that he can no longer read as well as he would like. On fundoscopy his left fundus is hyperaemic and oedematous. You are unable to obtain clear views of his right fundus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Drug abuse,Foster Kennedy's syndrome,Kallman's syndrome,Leber's herditary optic neuropathy,Leigh syndrome,B,"Foster Kennedy's syndrome is a combination of optic atrophy and central scotoma, contralateral papilloedema and anosmia. It is caused by optic and olfactory nerve compression and raised intracranial pressure. This is often secondary to a mass such as an olfactory groove meningioma. Patients may also have other symptoms of raised intracranial pressure such as nausea and vomiting, and frontal symptoms such as emotional lability and memory loss. Drug abuse is not the best answer; whilst drug abuse may account for his abnormal affect it would not cause the other symptoms. Kallman's syndrome is incorrect as it is characterised by hypogonadism and anosmia. Leber's herditary optic neuropathy is a mitochondrial disorder causing visual loss in young men but would not account for his other symptoms. Leigh syndrome is a rare neurometabolic disorder affecting the central nervous system."
urinary system,252,During which age range is IgA nephropathy usually diagnosed?,10-20 years,20-40 years,40-60 years,60-70 years,70+,B,IgA nephropathy has a male preponderance and is commonly diagnosed in the age range of 20-40. The options which fall out of this age range are incorrect and should not be selected.

This is a rare form of vasculitis (necrotising granulomatous) which can affect numerous organs however most commonly effects the upper respiratory tract, lungs and kidneys. There is often a history of rhinorrhoea. Churg Strauss syndrome can lead to these symptoms however asthma is a key component. Goodpastures syndrome can also effect pulmonary and renal systems however does not lead to the upper respiratory tract features. CANCA is more specific for wegeners granulomatosis."
urinary system,254,"A 32-year-old woman of 38 weeks gestation complains of feeling unwell with fever, rigors and abdominal pains. The pain was initially located in the abdomen and was associated with urinary frequency and dysuria. The pain has now become more generalized specifically radiating to the right loin. She says that she has felt occasional uterine tightening. CTG is reassuring. Select the most likely diagnosis?",Acute fatty liver of pregnancy,Acute pyelonephritis,Round ligament stretching,Cholecystitis,UTI,B,"Fever, rigor, abdominal pain associated with frequency, dysurea and radiation to the right loin suggests right sided pyelonephritis"
urinary system,255,"A 30-year-old male presents with a week history of right arm weakness. Originally the problem began with severe pain in the neck which radiated into the right shoulder, which was followed by weakness. Examination revealed winging of the right scapula with weakness of right shoulder abduction and elbow extension. There was some sensory loss over the lateral aspect of the right shoulder and right triceps reflex was absent. What is the most likely diagnosis?",C7 entrapment radiculopathy,Central C5/6 disc prolapse,Neuralgic amyotrophy,Suprascapular nerve entrapment,Traction of lateral cord of brachial plexus,C,Neuralgic amyotrophy is a brachial plexopathy (usually upper brachial plexus) usually preceded by an infective picture. It usually presents with severe pain for days to weeks followed by weakness and sensory loss over the corresponding territory of the brachial plexus (more commonly C5-7). It is self-limiting condition but recovery may be slow (years).
urinary system,256,"A 29-year-old female presents with drooping of the left side of her face and an inability to close her left eye. She had a viral illness in the preceding week. There is no past medical history. On examination, there is a left VII^th nerve palsy. The remaining cranial nerves are normal. Power, tone and reflexes are normal in the limbs. What is the best course of treatment?",Intravenous immunoglobulin,No treatment,Oral Augmentin,Oral prednisolone,Oral valaciclovir and prednisolone,D,"This is the classical history of a post-viral Bell's palsy. There is some evidence to support a short course of steroids in the acute stages of the illness^1. This study suggests improved recovery of facial function with early treatment. No benefit was seen in aciclovir added to prednisolone in this study. Oral valaciclovir has been evaluated with an RCT but consensus supports steroids (with some clinicians continuing to support the concomitant use of aciclovir). You need to be confident that there are no features of Guillain-Barré (test reflexes), or brain stem vascular disease or space occupying lesion. The neurological examination of the cranial nerves thus needs to be completed with care. "
urinary system,257,Which of the following is a characteristic feature of transient global amnesia?,Abnormal behaviour,Apraxia,Confabulation,Loss of personal identity,Normal perception,E,"Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a syndrome characterised by the abrupt onset of anterograde amnesia, accompanied by repetitive questioning. Patients are usually disoriented in time and place, but not usually person. They often recognise their disorientation. By definition, there are no other neurological deficits. It usually occurs in middle-aged or elderly people, and attacks typically occur in the mornings and last minutes to hours (mean 6h). The attack is often associated with headache, nausea and dizziness. The ability to lay down new memories is gradually recovered, leaving only a dense amnesic gap for the duration of the episode (and often the hours prior to it). Recurrence is unusual. Whilst clear-cut focal neurological signs are exclusion criteria for TGA, associated symptoms are commonly observed. The patient's behaviour during an attack may lead to them being described as confused. Other associated features are chills, fear of death, paraesthesia, emotional upset and chest pain. Migraine may be a risk factor in younger patients (less than55y). Psychological and vascular risk factors may also have a role. It has also been suggested that TGA may occur after a venous congestion in the context of insufficient jugular-vein valves. 'Characteristic' means that absence of the symptom would make you doubt the diagnosis. The presence of any of the other suggested options would suggest an alternative diagnosis. "
urinary system,258,"A 39-year-old Caucasian man with symptomatic HIV disease developed multiple, painless, skin coloured, umbilicated papular lesions on his face. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his skin lesions?",Cytomegalovirus (CMV),Epstein Barr virus (EBV),Human herpes virus (HHV) 8,Human papilloma virus (HPV 16),Pox virus,E,"Multiple painless umbilicated papular lesions are typical of molluscum contagiosum and are caused by pox virus and oftenskin coloured. CMV does not cause painless papular lesions. EBV causes Burkitt's lymphoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and primary brain lymphomas. HHV 8 is strongly associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and these lesions are often red/purple. HPV 16 is associated with squamous cell carcinomas in cervix, penis, anus and oral cavity. "
urinary system,259,"A 70-year-old man presents with difficulty speaking. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination the patient is awake, his blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg. His pulse is irregularly irregular. He has 4/5 strength on the right arm and leg and 5/5 strength on the left. When asked to point to the window he appears unable to do so. When told to raise his arms and place his hands out he does not. When visually shown the same action he is able to perform it. When asked to repeat 'Today is a sunny day', he is able to do so. With what is this type of dysphasia consistent?",Broca's aphasia,Global aphasia,Transcortical motor aphasia,Transcortical sensory aphasia,Wernicke's aphasia,D,"The main problem lies within the brain in a region known as the temporal-occipital-parietal junction, located behind Wernicke's area. The patient has intact repetition but is unable to follow verbal commands. He has fluent grammatical speech. In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In Wernicke's or fluent or receptive aphasia the patient is able to form correct grammatical sentences but language content is incorrect. It localises to the dominant superior temporal gyrus. There is poor comprehension and repetition but verbal output is fluent. In transcortical motor aphasia, which localises to the anterior superior frontal lobe, the patient has good comprehension and repetition but has halting, effortful speech. Patients also have impaired writing skills. Global aphasia results in an almost mute patient: there is poor verbal output, comprehension, repetition and understanding. Transcortical sensory aphasia is what is described in this case. It is characterised by impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech, and is caused by damage to the temporal lobes. It differs from Wernicke's aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition, and exhibit cholalia (the compulsive repetition of words). Improvement may be seen with speech therapy. "

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer six months earlier for which he is undergoing treatment. Chest x ray reveals a cannonball appearance in the right lung and diffuse infiltrative opacity in the left lung. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?,Carcinoid tumour,Large cell undifferentiated carcinoma,Lung metastases,Mesothelioma,Pancoast tumour,C,"The lungs are frequent sites for metastasis from tumours elsewhere in the body. Although cannonball appearance in chest radiography may strongly suggest a metastatic lesion, it may also be seen with primary lung tumours. It has to be acknowledged that metastatic disease may assume a variety of radiographic appearances from nodular disease to an infiltrative, poorly defined opacity."
urinary system,261,"A 14 year old boy is admitted following an epileptic seizure. This is his first seizure and on examination you note learning difficulties, a bumpy rash on his nose and cheeks and a blood pressure of 135/82 mmHg. His blood results are normal but a urine dipstick reveals trace levels of blood and an ultrasound shows cysts in both kidneys. What is the diagnosis?",MEN1,Glioblastoma multiforme,Neurofibromatosis,Tuberous sclerosis,Polycystic kidney disease,D,"Tuberous sclerosis is a disease in which a mutation in tumour suppressor genes result in growths throughout the body. The most common signs are periungual fibromas, hypopigmented lesions, epilepsy, renal cysts and retinal hamartoma. Most patients have learning difficulties of varying severity. The intracranial growths lower the seizure threshold and are seen in 90% of cases."
urinary system,262,A 34-year-old lady is brought into the emergency department with protracted seizures. Laboratory studies reveal that her serum sodium is 114 mmol/litre. The attending physicians wish to treat her with 'hypertonic saline' - stronger than the normal physiologic concentration. What is deemed to be the physiologic concentration of saline?,0.45%,0.90%,1.20%,3%,5%,B,There are few indications for hypertonic saline. Ongoing seizures secondary to hyponatraemia is one such indication. There are a number of hypertonic saline solution concentrations above the normal physiological value of 0.9%. The question asks for the physiological saline concentration and so 0.9% is correct. Other answers listed are not physiologic and should not be selected. Saline at 0.45% concentration is often termed half normal saline. The remaining options represent hypertonic saline concentrations that can be administered.
urinary system,263,Which of the following is true regarding adenocarcinoma of the kidney?,Can lead to polycythaemia,Have an abdominal mass palpable in about 90% of cases,Is more common in infants and young children,Pain is usually the presenting symptom,Present with a right varicocele,A,"Adenocarcinoma (RCC), arising from renal tubular cells, is the most common neoplasm of the kidney (75%). It is more prevalent in patients over 40 years of age and affects more males than females (2:1). Haematuria with occasional clot colic is the usual presenting symptom. A dragging discomfort in the loin is felt in a significant proportion of the patients. An abdominal mass is palpable in only about 25-45% of the cases. In men, a rapidly developing varicocele (most often on the left) is a rare but impressive sign. This is because the left testicular vein drains into the left renal vein, whilst the right testicular vein drains directly into the inferior vena cava. Polycythaemia occurs in about 4% of cases as a result of erythropoietin production by tumour cells. The other symptoms (features) or presentations include:  Pyrexia Hypertension Hypercalcaemia, and Nephrotic syndrome."
urinary system,264,In a patient with renal artery stenosis what is the imaging modality of choice?,CT abdomen,Ultrasound scan,Magnetic resonance angiography,Radionuclide scans,CT angiography,C,Radionuclide scans are no longer utilised for the diagnosis. MRA are safe and non invasive way of imaging the vessel and the extent of disease and should therefore be utilised. CT angiography runs a risk of contrast nephropathy. AN ultrasound is not diagnostic although renal artery stenosis may be suspected if there is one kidney larger than the other. Angiography is useful if it is thought that the stenosis may be amenable to intervention.
urinary system,265,A 35-year-old female presents with headaches. Examination reveals papilloedema. Which of the following would make the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) unlikely?,Absence of retinal venous pulsations,Bilateral upgoing plantar responses,Normal ventricles on CT or MRI scan,Reduced visual acuity,Sixth cranial nerve palsy,B,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is typically associated with papilloedema, reduced venous pulsation and normal appearances of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A VI^th nerve palsy is a recognised association. Reflexes are preserved and plantars are flexor. Extensor plantars suggest a alternative diagnosis."

He reports that he woke up this morning and attempted to get out of bed but felt dizzy. He felt nauseous and was unable to get out of bed to go to the bathroom. His wife was concerned as this had never happened before and called for the ambulance. On arrival at the emergency room his blood pressure was 180/70 mmHg, pulse was regular at 60 beats per minute and he was apyrexial. Blood sugar was within normal limits. On neurological examination his visual fields were full, and fundoscopy was notable for grade 2 hypertensive retinopathy. He had left jerk nystagmus on looking to the left and left jerk nystagmus on looking to the right. He was able to perform finger to nose and heel to shin normally. Epleys manouver was positive.  On standing the patient felt dizzy. His blood pressure was 170/80 mmHg after three minutes standing. He refused to walk for fear of falling. The rest of his examination was unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benign paroxsysmal positional vertigo,Cerebrovascular accident,Hypertensive encephalopathy,Labyrinthitis,Orthostatic hypotension,A,"This patient is suffering from acute onset vertigo and nausea, with nystagmus a dominant feature on examination. This would fit best with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, which occurs due to otolith detachment into the semicircular canals of the inner ear.  The constellation of symptoms here would be difficult to explain by a stroke - if the posterior circulation were affected you would also expect dysarthria and impaired coordination. The patient is not orthostatic on examination by definition. Labyrinthitis typically has associated tinnitus and a history of infection or head trauma. This history, and blood pressure, does not fit with hypertensive encephalopathy."
urinary system,267,A 30-year-old lady who suffers from migraine complains that taking the recommended dose of paracetamol during an attack fails to relieve her headache. She has no other significant past medical history. She is a smoker of 15 cigarettes per day and also drinks alcohol 16 units per week. Which of the following factors most likely explains the lack of efficacy of paracetamol in this lady?,Bacterial overgrowth,Delayed gastric emptying,First pass metabolism,p450 enzyme induction,p450 enzyme inhibition,B,"When salicylate absorption from effervescent aspirin tablets was studied during migraine, the rate of absorption was found to be reduced relative to that found in non-migrainous volunteers and in the same patients when headache-free. There is evidence that this reduced rate of absorption is caused by gastrointestinal stasis and reduced rate of gastric emptying. Patients in whom aspirin absorption was delayed were more likely to take longer to respond and to require additional treatment.andquot;^1 Metoclopramide may be useful in accelerating gastric emptying. The same has also been shown with paracetamol absorption.^2 "

What is the most appropriate investigation?,MRI spine,Radionuclide bone scan,DEXA scan,Serum ALP concentration,Serum calcium concentration,B,"MRI is good for soft tissue but not for bone. If it was radiculopathy, spinal cord compression or prolapsed disc creating pressure on nerve MRI would be fine but not for bony metastasis. Here investigation of choice is radionuclide bone scan"
urinary system,271,A 72-year-old man presents with Parkinson's disease. Which of the following is a likely mechanism underlying the neurodegeneration seen in this condition?,Aberrant fusion of 2 genes,Impaired protein degradation,Overexpression of cellular oncogene,Post-translational modification,Telomere shortening,B,"Mutations in either the parkin gene or UCHL1 lead to impaired protein degradation. The other genetic abnormalities concern other diseases, not Parkinson's. Impaired protein degradation is also seen in other neurodegenerative conditions. "
urinary system,272,"A 60-year-old man wishes to act as a kidney donor to his 37-year-old wife. She has end stage renal failure from polycystic kidney disease and is maintained on peritoneal dialysis. The couple has two teenage daughters, neither of whom have renal cysts on recent ultrasound scans. Which one of the following statements is correct?",Living related donation from one of the daughters would be preferable to donation from the husband,Living unrelated donation is not recommended in cases of inherited renal disease,The age difference between husband and wife is a relative contraindication to transplantation,The husband should not be accepted for kidney donation until all siblings have been considered,The results of living unrelated kidney donation are sufficiently poor that organ donation should not proceed ,D,"Providing there is a sibling who is proven not to have polycystic kidney disease, living related donation should be considered as this would ensure a better match and better graft survival. Siblings are close genetically, and therefore usually are a better match than spouses. The age difference is not, however, a contraindication to kidney donation. As polycystic kidney disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, there is a significant (50%) risk that this lady's daughters have been affected. Obviously, if affected they are not suitable to act as renal transplant donors. Cysts usually develop during teenage years, so one cannot be confident a child has not been affected until they are at least 20: a normal ultrasound scan at 20 years of age means you can be 90% confident they are not affected, a normal scan at 30 increases the confidence level to 98%. Therefore this lady's siblings (who presumably are all adults) should be considered prior to her children, as those siblings affected by the condition should already be showing the phenotype.  Living unrelated kidney donation could also be considered, and is increasing in use in the UK. In patients with polycystic kidney disease, or for other inherited diseases, a graft from an unrelated donor would not necessarily succumb to the same disease process. Results are usually excellent if a good match is found. This is usually organised by being on the transplant waiting list, therefore receiving a kidney from a family member is often quicker. As polycystic kidney disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition, there is a significant (50%) risk that this lady's daughters have been affected.

urinary system,273,"A 45 year old female is admitted with cellulitus requiring IV antibiotics. She is commenced on IV benzylpenicillin and IV flucloxacillin. She is commenced on Diclofenac for pain. After 3 days she she develops pyrexia, arthralgia, maculopapular rash, haematuria and oliguria. Bloods reveal acute renal failure and eosinophilia. A renal biopsy reveals interstitial cellular infiltrate with eosinophils present and variable tubular necrosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylaxis,Penicillin induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis,Glomerulonephritis,NSAID induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis,Chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis,B,"The most likely diagnosis is penicillin induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Penicillins are a common cause and unlike NSAID induced TIN, haematuria is often a feature. It typically leads to these clinical features and the renal biopsy findings. Eosinophilia is common."
urinary system,274,A 69-year-old man developed Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. He was started on gentamicin. Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity correlates with which one of the following?,Frequency of aminoglycoside dosing,High peak and low trough aminoglycoside levels,Ototoxicity,Post-antibiotic effect,Supratherapeutic doses administered once daily,A,"Aminoglycoside undergoes glomerular filtration and then reabsorption in the proximal tubule where tubular cell injury/death occurs. Administering aminoglycoside less frequently allows the kidney more time to andquot;recoverandquot; from drug accumulation within the proximal tubular cells and hence minimises nephrotoxicity. Although aminoglycoside toxicity is not that common, over the past years an experimental animal model has provided insights regarding the mechanisms of cytotoxicity. Aminoglycoside toxicity occurs in those cell types in which the drug accumulates; primarily the proximal tubules in the cortex. Multiple human clinical trials (including meta-analysis), as well as animal studies, report less nephrotoxicity and equal efficacy when aminoglycosides are given once daily (supratherapeutic doses) rather than in conventional divided doses. This once-daily dosing approach exploits the post-antibiotic bactericidal effect even when drug levels fall below the so-called andquot;therapeutic levelsandquot; allowing for a longer dosing interval (thus high peaks and low troughs are desirable). Ototoxicity probably has a different underlying pathophysiology from that of nephrotoxicity; the two do not predict one another."
urinary system,275,Which of the following is true of myasthenia gravis (MG)?,Electrical recordings of single motor unit activity commonly reveal variation in the latency of the various muscle fibre responses (jitter),Neurotransmitter released at the motor end plate is greatly reduced,Repetitive stimulation of a motor nerve produces a reduction in the amplitude of the fifth response compared with the first in 98% of cases (electrodecremental test),Subjective improvement in muscle strength following edrophonium is diagnostic of the condition,There is a strong association with anti-noradrenergic receptor antibodies,A,"This is a difficult question. Anti-acetylcholine (Ach) receptor antibodies are typically found in myasthenia gravis (MG) resulting in reduced ACh receptor numbers but sufficient neurotransmitter is released. This leads to fatiguable weakness. Single fibre electromyography (EMG) is the most sensitive test for myasthenia gravis. It simultaneously records the variability in potentials of two muscle fibres innervated by an individual axon: jitter. Although abnormal jitter is not specific for MG and may occur in polymyositis and ALS, a large degree of jitter with minimal other abnormalities is suggestive of the diagnosis. Jitter is the most sensitive emg index in MG but is not specific of the condition. The nerve conductions and electromyogram (EMG) studies are usually normal in myasthenia gravis, but the repetitive stimulation of a nerve may demonstrate decrements of the muscle action potential (far less than 98%). An increase in decrement on stimulation at 3Hz is detectable in some patients. The Tensilon (edrophonium) challenge test can be used to diagnose MG, or distinguish it from cholinergic crisis. Edrophonium given at increasing doses should produce improvement in muscle strength within a minute. It does this by blocking the breakdown of acetylcholine by cholinesterase and temporarily increases the level of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. However, a positive response is not specific and may occur in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. There is a risk of bradycardia, asystole and heart block and atropine should therefore be available. Airway support should be used as respiratory weakness can be exacerbated after the edrophonium wears off. Although improved muscle strength after edrophonium is seen, it is not diagnostic but depends more on the clinical presentation and presence of AChR ab."

urinary system,277,"A 45-year-old man has a history of progressive weakness for five weeks. He had particular difficulty getting out of the bath. On examination there was severe truncal and proximal limb weakness, without wasting or fasciculation. Tendon reflexes, plantar responses and sensation were all normal. The vital capacity was 1.8L. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cervical myelitis,Guillain-Barre syndrome ,Polio,Polymyositis,Syringobulbia,D,The presentation of myopathy is characterised by proximal weakness with normal reflexes and sensation and the absence of fasciculations. Polymyositis is the commonest cause of inflammatory muscle disease in people under 50-years-old (inclusion body myositis is the commonest in those over 50-years-old).
urinary system,278,"A 50-year-old woman presented to her GP with a four month history of progressive distal sensory loss and weakness of both legs and arms. The weakness and numbness had extended to the elbows and knees. On examination, cranial nerves and fundoscopy were normal. Examination of the upper limb revealed bilaterally reduced tone and 3/5 power. Lower limb examination revealed some mild weakness of hip flexion and extension with marked weakness of dorsiflexion and plantarflexion. Both knee and ankle jerks were absent and both plantar responses were mute. There was absent sensation to all modalities affecting both feet extending to the knees. A lumbar puncture was performed and yielded the following data:    Opening pressure 14 cm H2O (5-18)   CSF protein 0.75 g/L (0.15-0.45)   CSF white cell count 10 cells per ml (less than5 cells)   CSF white cell differential 90% lymphocytes -   CSF red cell count 2 cells per ml (less than5 cells)    Nerve conduction studies showed multifocal motor and sensory conduction block with prolonged distal latencies. What is the likely diagnosis in this patient?",Cervical spondylosis,Chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy (CIDP),Guillain-Barré syndrome,Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN),Multifocal motor neuropathy,B,"The history is compatible with a subacute sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy. Causes of such conditions include inflammatory neuropathies such as chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and paraproteinaemic neuropathies. CIDP is characterised by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the upper and lower limbs. The cause of the demyelination is not understood, but it is more common in young adults and in men. It presents with abnormal sensation (which typically begins distally), weakness of the limbs, areflexia and fatigue. Treatment for CIDP includes corticosteroids, plasmapheresis and intravenous immunoglobulin. Physiotherapy is an effective adjunct. The course varies widely, and patients may be left with residual neurology or suffer a number of relapses. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an acute post-infectious neuropathy, thought possibily to be a post-infectious phenomenon, which reaches its peak in severity within six weeks. CIDP is closely linked to GBS, and is thought by some to be its chronic counterpart. Both CIDP and GBS can affect motor and sensory nerves, and it is the four month history which distinguishes the two here. Cervical spondylosis would cause upper motor neurone signs such as hyperreflexia, extensor plantar response and possibly a sensory level. HMSN is normally a very chronic neuropathy developing over many years and usually with a family history of the condition. Multifocal motor neuropathy is a treatable neuropathy affecting motor conduction only. It is associated with antibodies to a ganglioside component of peripheral myelin. "

It results from degeneration of the intervertebral discus and facet joints in the cervical spine. Radiographic evidence of disc degeneration is present in 25% of patients younger than 40 years, 50% over 40 and 85% over 60. In the majority of cases it is asymptomatic, and it is difficult to define the boundary between normal ageing and the disease process. Risk factors include rugby, horse-riding and flying, all of which increase loads on the head. Both sexes are affected equally, but problems begin earlier in males. Degenerative changes affecting the intervertebral discs, vertebrae, facet joints, and ligamentous structures encroach on the cervical spinal canal and damage the cord, especially in patients with a congenitally small canal. Symptoms related to myelopathy and radiculopathy are caused by the formation of osteophytes, which narrow the diameter of the spinal canal at one or multiple levels. This may produce direct neurological damage or ischaemic changes and therefore lead to spinal cord disturbances. Radiculopathy is due to compression, stretching or angulation of the cervical nerve roots. Myelopathy is due to compression, ischaemia or recurring minor trauma to the cord. Cervical spondylitic myelopathy is the most common cause of myelopathy in adults. Patients present with signs and symptoms of cervical spinal cord dysfunction with or without cervical nerve root injury. There is therefore a mixture of upper and lower motor neurone signs. These may or may not be accompanied by pain in the neck and/or upper limb, orbits or temporal regions. In addition there is often cervical stiffness, and poor balance. On examination there is limited range of movement of the cervical spine and poorly localised tenderness. Radiculopathy causes dermatomal pain, often with accompanying changes in sensation or weakness in related muscles. The most commonly affected nerve roots are C5-7, and sensory symptoms (shooting pain, numbness, hyperaesthesia) are more common than weakness. Dural irritation can be demonstrated with the Spurling test in which radicular pain is reproduced with lateral flexion and rotation of the neck, with pressure on top of the patient's head. Reflexes are usually reduced. The differential diagnosis is broad, and includes acute neck strain, osteomyelitis, fibromyalgia, inflammatory arthritis and osteoporosis. The diagnosis can often be made on clinical grounds, but if neurological abnormality is present appropriate investigations include MRI and electrophysiology. High signal-intensity lesions on MRI indicate a poor prognosis. Management can be medical or surgical. Initially conservative measures such as regular activity, physiotherapy and addressing risk factors should be instigated. A cervical collar should not be used. Analgesia, anti-inflammatories and tricyclic antidepressants can be helpful. Indications for surgery include progressive neurological defects, compression of the cervical nerve root and/or spinal cord and intractable pain. Decompression improves neurologic function in some patients and prevents worsening in others, but there are significant risks. Epidural injection can be considered where surgical intervention is not an option. In general, progression of cervical spondylosis is slow, although 10% develop chronic neck pain. Motor neurone disease is an important differential diagnosis of upper and lower motor neuron dysfunction in this age group. It is slightly more prevalent in men than women. However, you would expect muscular weakness to be the predominant symptom and this is only minor in the above case. Sensory disturbance is uncommon. Myeloma can cause spinal cord and or nerve/root compression but one would expect other features to be present such as bone pain, bleeding or bruising and symptoms of hypercalcaemia. Blood tests typically show anaemia, leucopenia and thrombocytopeania, none of which are present in this case. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disorder characterised by severe bilateral pain and morning stiffness of the neck, shoulder and pelvic girdle. The ESR and CRP are markedly raised, and neurological signs are uncommon. In syringomyelia there is a fluid-filled cavity within the central spinal cord (usually cervical). As this enlarges and expands it compresses the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts, and later the anterior horn cells. Sensory symptoms are therefore a dominant feature. It most commonly presents in the 20s and 30s. "

urinary system,283,A 65-year-old man presents with renal colic. The following day he passes a stone in his urine with analysis revealing that it is composed of uric acid. Which one of the following is the most likely cause of this type of renal stone?,Allopurinol,Chronic renal failure,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Thiazide diuretics,Secondary polycythaemia,D,"Uric acid stones occur in 5-25% of all cases of nephrolithiasis. They are associated with hyperuricaemia and hyperuricosuria. Predisposing factors for uric acid stone formation are:  Dehydration High purine load (high protein diet) As a primary factor in idiopathic gout, and Associated with high cell turnover (for example, haematological malignancy).  Allopurinol is prescribed to treat gout and prevents uric acid formation - hence it reduces the frequency of uric acid stones. Chronic renal failure is incorrect as there is hyperuricaemia without hyperuricosuria. Hyperparathyroidism is associated with calcium stones, not uric acid stones. The correct answer is thiazide diuretics. Thiazide diuretics cause hyperuricaemia and can predispose to hyperuricosuria and uric acid stone formation. Uric acid stones are also associated with underlying hypertension. Thiazide diuretics are used to treat calcium stones as they increase the reabsorption of calcium from the proximal tubules, preventing hypercalciuria. Primary polycythaemia would predispose to uric acid stone formation, whereas secondary polycythaemia does not."

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Brainstem CVA,Herpes simplex encephalitis,Meningococcal meningitis,Sagittal sinus thrombosis,Sphenoidal wing meningioma,D,"Patients with a hypercoagulable state (pregnancy) and papilloedema with neurological signs should be investigated for cerebral venous thrombosis. The superior sagittal sinus, which drains the upper part of the cerebral hemispheres, can become thrombosed (usually as an extension of cortical vein thrombosis). Whilst anterior occlusion is usually asymptomatic, posterior occlusion can present with raised intracranial pressure (headache, vomiting), and involvement of the upper hemispheres (paraplegia). In addition, there can be seizures and papilloedema. There can also be a disorder of the oculomotor nerve by affecting the oculomotor (Edinger-Westphal) nuclei. The territory of the affected sinus usually shows congestive oedema, which can progress to haemorrhagic venous infarction. The treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis depends on the underlying aetiology. If primary, as in this case, anticoagulants should be given (full-dose heparin then warfarin). Secondary thrombosis is usually secondary to infection, which should be treated or drained if possible. Dexamethasone can be used to reduce cerebral oedema. The other conditions described here are all less likely in this setting."

urinary system,286,"A 60 year-old male who had been admitted a month ago with a left hemiparesis due to a right thalamic infarction re-presents with painful subluxation of his left shoulder. Two weeks later he develops severe, constant burning left shoulder pain which radiates down his arm. He found no relief from paracetamol. Which of the following is most likely to relieve his pain?",Depo-Medrone injection into the shoulder,Diclofenac,Dihydrocodeine,Gabapentin,Tramadol,D,"The description of the pain (burning, radiating) supports the diagnosis of neuropathic pain. Thalamic infarcts commonly cause late-onset of severe neuropathic pain weeks to months after the stroke. The pain is intractable to analgesics. The treatment of choice for neuropathic pain is amitriptyline/gabapentin. There are randomised controlled trials which support their value in neuropathic pain."
urinary system,287,Urinary protein:creatinine ratio (PCR) represents a reliable way of quantifying proteinuria. What PCR value in mg/mmol approximates to a 24-hour urine protein collection of 1 g?,10 mg/mmol,100 mg/mmol,500 mg/mmol,750 mg/mmol,1 g/mmol,B,Urinary protein creatinine ratio is a spot test that has been shown to approximate 24-hour urinary protein collection reliably. It avoids the cumbersome nature of collecting urine over 24 hours. Average individuals pass around 10 mmol urinary creatinine each day. Therefore:  uPCR 25 = 250 mg protein/day uPCR 100 = 1000 mg protein/day  A 24-hour urinary protein collection of 1 g is therefore approximately equivalent to urinary PCR of 100 mg/mmol. The other values are incorrect and should not be selected. 
urinary system,288,"A 17-year-old boy presented with a non-blanching rash over his legs, a swollen knee, and painless frank haematuria. Investigations revealed:    Serum creatinine 210 µmol/L (60-110)   Urine dipstick analysis: Blood +++   Urine dipstick analysis: Protein +   Urine culture Negative   Ultrasound of the kidneys Normal    Which glomerular abnormality is most likely to be present at renal biopsy?",Focal and segmental sclerosis,Foot process fusion,Linear deposition of IgG on the basement membrane,Mesangial deposition of IgA,Thickening of basement membranes,D,"The likely diagnosis here is Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). HSP is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause characterised by IgA-dominant immune complexes in smaller venules, capillaries, and arterioles. It presents with purpura, arthritis (especially ankles and knees), abdominal pains, haematuria, and proteinuria. HSP is often associated with infectious agents such as group A Streptococci and Mycoplasma. If there is progression to renal impairment then renal histopathology may include minimal change to severe glomerulonephritis that is indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy. However, mesangial IgA deposits are the most typical features of HSP on renal biopsy."
urinary system,289,A 40-year-old man has been in a road traffic accident. His Glasgow coma scale (GCS) is 8. Which of the following could describe his condition?,"A man lying still, eyes open and quiet. On questioning he appears confused. He is able to raise his eyebrows on command but cannot move his arms or legs at all. An MRI has shown damage to his spinal cord at C3.","A man lying still, eyes shut and groaning. Not responding to voice. On firm nail bed pressure he opens his eyes and withdraws his hand.","A man lying still, eyes shut, not making any noise. On command he opens his eyes and raises his hands but still makes no sound.","A man writhing around, eyes open and calling out obscenities. He smells strongly of alcohol. He variably obeys verbal commands.","A man writhing around, eyes open and screaming. Not responding to voice or following commands. On firm nail bed pressure he pushes your hand away.",B,"The Glasgow coma scale (GCS) can be useful as a predictor of outcome and a way to measure and monitor patients with reduced consciousness. It is made up of three components: eye opening, best verbal response and best motor response. Each of these is scored, as shown below. Eye opening:    Spontaneously 4   To speech 3   To painful stimulus 2   No response 1    Best verbal response:    Orientated 5   Disorientated 4   Inappropriate words 3   Incomprehensible sounds 2   No response 1    Best motor response:    Obeys verbal commands 6   Localises painful stimuli 5   Withdrawal to pain 4   Flexion to pain 3   Extension to pain 2   No response 1    The GCS defines coma as E = 2, V = 2, M = 4 or less. The GCS is meaningless unless it is broken down into its components. It is important to note that the GCS is unreliable and should not be applied to patients who are inebriated, intubated or who have a therapeutic or traumatic paralysis. The first option is not the correct answer. This man may well have a high C-spine lesion so the GCS score is slightly trickier to work out. He would score 4 for eyes and 4 for verbalisation. He would score 6 for motor as he is able to raise his eyebrows on command - he is unable to move his limbs due to paralysis rather than depressed consciousness. The second option is the correct answer. GCS would be E = 2, V = 2, M = 4. The third option is not the correct answer since the GCS is E = 3, V = 1, M = 6. The fourth option is incorrect. This man sounds as though he may be drunk making the GCS unreliable. From the description, taking his best verbal and motor skills his GCS is E = 4, V = 4-5 (depending on the context and content of the obscenities), M = 6. The fifth option is incorrect. GCS would be E = 4, V = 2, M = 5."
urinary system,290,A 66-year-old gentleman is admitted with an exacerbation of chronic congestive heart failure and is treated with intravenous diuretics. His serum potassium results are shown below. Admission:    Serum potassium 4 mmol/L (3.5-5.0)    Day 3 of admission:    Serum potassium 3 mmol/L (3.5-5.0)    Which is the best estimate of the total body potassium loss of this patient since admission?,1 mmol,10 mmol,50 mmol,75 mmol,200 mmol,E,"This question highlights the importance of potassium distribution within the body. It is a predominantly intracellular ion. Small reductions in serum potassium are associated with relatively large reductions in total body potassium. 1 mmol, 10 mmol, 50 mmol and 75 mmol are all under-estimates of total body potassium and therefore are incorrect and should not be selected. There is no exact formula to derive the 200 mmol. The candidates should recognise that potassium is mainly an intracellular ion (about 95% is intracellular). An approximation for total body loss for potassium is that a drop in 1 mmol/L K^+ of serum potassium in approximately equivalent to a 200 mmol K^+ total body loss. It should be stressed that this is an approximation. Given that 200 mmol is an approximate calculation, the other options are deliberately chosen to be clearly incorrect (the next highest value being 75 mmol). This question should correlate with clinical experience. It is rare that a large drop in potassium can be corrected with a few tablets with oral potassium and often intravenous replacement at higher doses are required. "
urinary system,291,A 32-year-old female is diagnosed with Goodpasture's syndrome. Which of the following therapies used in conjunction with plasmapheresis and corticosteroids would be expected to improve prognosis associated with the condition?,Azathioprine,Cyclophosphamide,Cyclosporin,Mycophenolate mofetil,Tacrolimus,B,"Studies reveal that without treatment mortality is as high as 90% in association with Goodpasture's. However the prognosis is drastically improved with the removal of antibody through plasmapheresis, immunosuppression with corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. There are some studies revealing the potential of mycophenolate mofetil but the evidence is rather anecdotal."
urinary system,292,A 30-year-old fit male becomes anuric following abdominal surgery. Investigations reveal:    Serum urea 9.2 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 120 μmol/L (60-110)    The blood pressure is 110/60 mmHg. What is the next single most appropriate course of action in the management of the anuria?,1 L normal saline intravenously over one hour,Commence intravenous low-dose dopamine,Give 500 ml intravenous plasma expander,Give an 80 mg intravenous bolus of furosemide,Urgent renal ultrasound,A,"This question deals with postoperative acute renal failure. Note that even when the glomerular filtration rate is zero, the serum creatinine tends not to rise faster than 200 mmol/L per day - so the patient's creatinine of 120 µmol/L may be the beginning of established renal failure. Immediate management consists of restoring the circulation; debate still continues whether it is better to use colloid or crystalloid. In this case it would seem to be more appropriate to use 1 L of normal saline, as there is a time limit as well. If urine output and renal function recover as soon as intravascular volume is restored, the diagnosis of pre-renal uraemia is made; if they do not then the diagnosis is acute tubular necrosis (ATN). In a seemingly cardiovascularly-well 30-year-old, giving 1 L over an hour will not precipitate any problems. There is little evidence to suggest that loop diuretics and dopamine are effective in the treatment of ATN. "
urinary system,293,"A 67-year-old gentleman presents with purulent cough and fever. He has a right lower lobar consolidation on x ray. This is his third hospital admission for right sided pneumonia. He is not a smoker. His wife reports that he has been choking on food for the past few months and she has noticed that he has been stumbling and dragging his left foot for about five months. On examination he has atrophy of his quadriceps bilaterally with fasciculations. There is loss of ankle jerk on the left with power 3/5, positive Babinski sign and normal sensation. His right leg has hyperreflexic ankle jerks but absence of knee jerk. There is also marked weakness throughout and fasciculations. Sensation is intact. What is the likely diagnosis?",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,Huntington's disease,Miller Fisher syndrome,Multiple sclerosis,A,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a form of motor neurone disease. It causes degeneration of upper (UMN) and lower motor neurones (LMN), therefore giving a mixed picture with fasciculations and spasticity, weakness and hypo- or hyperreflexia. Sensation and autonomic function are usually unaffected. Cognition is usually normal, although they may have emotional lability. Patients usually notice stumbling gait or foot drop if legs affected first, they may progress to more 'bulbar' signs or arm signs. The diagnosis of ALS requires mixed UMN and LMN signs that are unattributable to any other disease. There is no definitive test for ALS, however MRI, EMG and NCS may help. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an hereditary sensory and motor neuropathy. There are several types with different genes identified. The features are pes cavus, 'champagne bottle' legs, hyporeflexia and fasciculations with distal sensory loss. Twenty five per cent of patients have a palpable popliteal nerve. Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that is autosomal dominant. The features are of choreiform movements, problems with coordination and walking, behavioural and psychiatric problems. The disease leads eventually to dementia and premature death. Miller Fisher is a form of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) with areflexia, ataxia and ophthalmoplegia. Multiple sclerosis would present in this age group and sex. It is due to autoimmune mediated demyelination. To make the diagnosis there must be two separate attacks separated in time and space (that is, affecting two different nerves and on two separate occasions). The commonest signs and symptoms are  Optic neuritis Sensory loss Spinal cord symptoms with spasticity Autonomic dysfunction of bladder and bowel Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and depression."
urinary system,294,"A 63-year-old woman presents following a visit to the well woman clinic where she is noted to be hypertensive. She has a history of hip osteoarthritis for which she has taken regular paracetamol. On examination she is obese with a BMI of 35 (less than25), has a blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg and glycosuria is noted. Her investigations show:    Fasting plasma glucose 18.3 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Serum urea 9.8 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 129 µmol/L (60-110)   24 hour urine protein concentration 1.8 g/d (less than0.2)    The ultrasonic appearance of both kidneys is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Analgesic nephropathy,Chronic glomerulonephritis,Diabetic nephropathy,Hypertensive nephropathy,Ischaemic nephropathy,C,"This patient is diabetic and has proteinuria. Although diabetic nephropathy usually takes five or more years to evolve, this patient is likely to have had the condition for many years prior to it now being diagnosed. In the early stages of diabetic nephropathy, the kidneys can be enlarged due to hyperfiltration. However, with time sclerosis results in reduction in the size. Normal or small kidneys can therefore be consistent with diabetic nephropathy.  Ischaemic nephropathy due to renal artery stenosis is unlikely in the presence of a normal renal ultrasound. Analgesic nephropathy would be a consequence of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) not paracetamol. Hypertensive nephropathy is a possibility but is less likely in the context of her proteinuria and moderately elevated BP.  Chronic glomerulonephritis is much less common than diabetic nephropathy, and would not explain the glycosuria. Often the kidneys are reduced in volume on the ultrasound scan."
urinary system,295,"A 61-year-old man has received a kidney transplant for chronic IgA nephropathy. He is on suitable immunosuppression with cyclosporine, steroids and mycophenolic acid. He has suffered two bouts of CMV infection over the last four months. Now, he came for follow up and complained of two painful nodules on his shin. He enjoyed a reasonably normal life and usually spent time indoors. Examination revealed two fungating nodules with surface bleeding spots below the knee. There was also one hard lymph node in the inguinal chain. What is the cause of development of this condition in this patient?",Cyclosporine,Mycophenolic acid,Opportunistic infection,Steroids,The organ transplantation itself,A,"This post-renal transplant patient has developed a skin malignancy. Post-transplant patients are much more prone to develop malignancy compared to normal population. Cyclosporine is one of the main reasons for development of post-transplant malignancy. Mycophenolic acid is a potent immunosuppressant, but it alone is not implicated in carcinogenesis. The clinical description is suggestive of a malignancy, not opportunistic infection. Steroids are not known to give rise to malignancy. Organ transplantation is an immunosuppressive state and it increases the risks for malignancy. But drugs like cyclosporine are the main culprit in causing malignancy. Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSC) are the commonest malignancies in post-transplant state. Of these, squamous cell Ca is the commonest. "
urinary system,296,"A 60-year-old man presents with right foot drop, left foot and left hand numbness, fever, malaise, weight loss, polymyalgia and polyarthralgia of approximately one month duration. On examination, he appears ill, with a temperature of 38.5°C and blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. Investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 80 g/L (130-180)   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate 100 mm/hr (0-20)   Serum creatinine 180 µmol/L (60-110)       Urine analysis Blood ++   Urine microscopy White cells and red cell casts    Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Antiphospholipid syndrome,Giant cell arteritis,Paraneoplastic syndrome,POEMS syndrome,Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN),E,"This patient has a mononeuritis multiplex, fever, hypertension, and nephritic renal involvement which is most consistent with a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa. PAN is a systemic transmural necrotising vasculitis that usually affects medium-sized arteries. Signs and symptoms are primarily attributable to diffuse vascular inflammation and ischaemia of the affected organs. In adults it most commonly presents in men between 40 and 50-years-old, and may be associated with hepatitis B. Virtually any organ with the exception of the lung can be affected, with peripheral neuropathy and symptoms from osteoarticular, renal artery and gastrointestinal tract involvement being the most frequent clinical manifestations. The diagnostic criteria used are based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and Chapel Hill Consensus criteria: Symptoms/signs must be compatible with a diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis or PAN, plus one of:  Histological proof of vasculitis and/or granuloma formation Positive ANCA serology Specific investigations strongly suggestive of vasculitis and/or granuloma Eosinophilia (greater than10%, no other potential diagnosis to explain the signs and symptoms) Malignancy Infection (HBV, HCV, HIV, TB, subacute bacterial endocarditis) Drugs (hydralazine, propylthiouracil, cocaine, allopurinol) Secondary vasculitis (resulting from rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, Sjogren's) Sarcoidosis or other vasculitic conditions Vasculitis mimicking diseases (e.g. cholesterol emboli, antiphospholipid)  Hepatitis B surface antigen is postivie in 30%, and p-ANCA is usually positive. Angiography demonstrates microaneurysms in affected organs, and biopsy shows necrotising inflammation. PAN can be further classified into systemic vs limited (cutaneous) and idiopathic vs hepatitis B, and this is important due to differences in pathogenesis and therefore treatment and prognosis. The mainstay of treatment for idiopathic PAN is currently corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, whereas for hepatitis B related disease plasmapheresis and antiviral agents should be used. Azathioprine can be used as maintenance therapy, and typically has fewer side effects than cyclophosphamide. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a thrombotic disorder that manifests clinically as recurrent venous or arterial thrombosis and/or foetal loss. It is not usually associated with a polyneuropathy. POEMS is a rare systemic disorder which consists of polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy monoclonal gammopathy and skin changes, of which a few features are absent; and nephritic syndrome is not a feature. Giant cell arteritis affects large and medium sized arteries, most commonly branches of the external carotid artery. It typically presents with unilateral headache and threatened sight, which does not fit with the clinical scenario above. Vasculitis can be a paraneoplastic syndrome, but this is rare and you would expect symptoms from the primary tumour. In a recent case series it most commonly presented with features of a cutaneous vasculitis. "

Which is the most appropriate course of action for this patient?",Albumin transfusion,Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy,High protein diet,Renal biopsy,Trial of steroid therapy,E,"This patient has nephrotic syndrome, which is a combination of:  Proteinuria (usually greater than 3g/24 hrs) Hypoalbuminaemia (less than35 g/L) Oedema Hyperlipidaemia.  The most appropriate course of action here would be to undergo a trial of steroid therapy. Ideally a renal biopsy would be indicated to determine the cause of the nephrotic syndrome, however, as this patient only has one kidney then this would be considered a relative contraindication for such a procedure. A high protein diet/albumin transfusion would be of little to no benefit - and the latter would need to be salt-poor. ACE inhibitors reduce proteinuria and slow deterioration in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In this case, given the patient's age, he may well have minimal change glomerulonephritis (GN) (commonest in children), which is normally steroid responsive. In the young adult histological diagnoses are in general: minimal change greater than mesangiocapillary greater than FSGS greater than lupus greater than membranous greater than diabetes. In general, steroids are tried first and then second line agents such as cyclosporine and cyclophosphamide are introduced if needed."
urinary system,298,"A 55-year-old man presents with neck pain, associated with a five day history of neck and shoulder stiffness. One week previously he had attended for a sigmoidoscopy and was given intravenous sedation during this procedure.  On examination, the temperature was 38.0°C, blood pressure was 100/60 mmHg and heart rate 100 bpm. There were absent biceps jerks and weakness of deltoid and triceps bilaterally. The cranial nerves and lower limbs were normal. There was a soft systolic murmur, and the chest was clear. Which examination is likely to confirm the diagnosis?",Cervical spine x ray,CT head,Echocardiography,Lumbar puncture,MRI neck,E,"The features suggest a paraspinal abscess affecting C4-C6 given the neurological findings. The investigation of the patient should include all of the above tests. Paraspinal abscess is often associated with infection in an intravenous (IV) line, which may or may not be apparent as cellulitis. Neurological signs, once apparent, should lead to rapid investigation as once they are present recovery of strength may be slow, or not at all. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck should delineate the anatomy of the abscess, which will not be seen on a computerised tomography (CT) scan of the head. However, given that these lesions are usually due to seeding of Staphylococcus aureus, endocarditis is a possibility. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) should show an elevated protein with raised white cells, and a low/normal glucose."
urinary system,299,A 75-year-old lady attends the Emergency department with a stroke affecting her left arm and leg. A CT scan confirms that there is a right CVA. Carotid scanning shows stenosis of 50% on the right and 90% on the left. After a couple of days of physiotherapy her symptoms are much improved. What is the best course of action?,Bilateral carotid endarterectomy,Discharge and GP follow up,Discharge and urgent outpatient follow up,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the left,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the right,C,"Carotid artery atherosclerosis is an important cause of iscahemic stroke. The left-sided neurological signs in this patient indicate the symptomatic carotid is on the right side. Carotid endarterectomy has been established as an effective treatment for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients. It reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death by 48% in a person with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis (greater than70%) who has had a TIA. The peri-operative risk of disabling stroke or death is approximately 3%. Current UK guidelines recommend endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis, based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial which showed clear benefit. The endarterectomy should be performed as soon as the patient is fit for surgery, preferably within two weeks of a TIA. The benefit is marginal for symptomatic patients with 50-69% stenosis, but may be greater in male patients. NICE recommends these patients are also considered for endarterectomy. There is significantly less benefit for asymptomatic patients, even those with greater than 60% stenosis. Patients with less than 50% stenosis should not be considered for carotid surgery. Recurrent stenosis can occur in 1-20% of patients following endarterectomy, and re-operation is needed in 1-3% of cases. Ipsilateral strokes occur in 9% of patients following endarterectomy, and 26% of those treated with medical management alone (within 2 years). All patients with suspected non-disabling stroke or TIA who are considered as candidates for carotid endarterectomy should have carotid imaging within 1 week. Carotid endarterectomy is also indicated following a non-disabling stroke. However, if the patient has had a disabling stroke there is no real benefit in them undergoing the procedure. Carotid stenting is increasingly being used as an alternative to endarterectomy. This is a less invasive revascularisation strategy, and uses an embolic protection device. There seems to be a similar early risk of death or stroke, and similar long-term benefits. Risk is higher in elderly patients, possibly due to vascular tortuosity and calcification. The procedure is currently indicated in selected cases, such as restenosis. Please note for this explanation we have used the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterecomy Trial (NASCET) criteria, as opposed to the European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group (ECST) criteria. See NICE guidelines for the difference - carotid imaging reports will state which criteria are being used. "
urinary system,300,Which of the following is the most common composition of renal stones?,Uric acid,Cysteine,Calcium phosphate,Calcium oxalate,Ammonium magnesium phosphate,D,"The most common stone composition is calcium oxalate on its own or in combination with calcium phosphate, accounting for approximately 80%. Hyperparathyroidism and renal tubular acidosis can lead to calcium phosphate deposition. The next common stone composition is Ammonium magnesium phosphate / struvite stones, accounting for 10 to 15%. These are formed in the presence of Proteus which are urease producing bacteria leading to ammonia and carbon dioxide production, alkalinising the urine. This allows precipitation of organic and inorganic salts. Uric acid stones account for 5 to 10% and are found in conditions which have a high uric acid in serum or urine. Cysteine stones are rare and are due to an inborn error of metabolism."

Lichen planus, lichen sclerosus and plasma cell balanitis are not associated with HIV infection.

This is defined as more than 3 g of proteinuria per day with serum albumin less than 25 g/L, oedema, and hypercholesterolaemia. Other complications of nephrotic syndrome include:  susceptibility to infection thromboses renal failure, and protein malnutrition.  The normal BP makes pre-eclampsia unlikely. Besides, the hypercholesterolaemia is the big clue."
urinary system,305,"A 56-year-old female presented to her GP with pain in the left side of her neck radiating down the lateral aspect of her arm and forearm. She had also noticed some weakness of her left shoulder and struggled to elevate her arm. She had a long-standing history of rheumatoid arthritis, treated with steroids and penicillamine. She was a non-smoker and did not drink any alcohol. On examination there was some wasting over the left deltoid and evidence of fasciculations. Neck movements appeared full except that lateral movement exacerbated the left arm pain. On examination of the upper limb, tone appeared reduced at the elbow and wrist and the biceps jerk was only present on re-enforcement. The left supinator jerk was inverted and the triceps jerk appeared brisk. There was some weakness of left shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and supination, but finger movements and elbow extension were intact. There was a sensory deficit over the lateral aspect of the left upper arm and forearm. The right arm appeared normal. On examination of he lower limb, tone was increased, but power appeared normal. All reflexes were brisk and both plantar responses were extensor. Investigations showed:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 3.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 245 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR (Westergren) 45 mm/1^st hour (0-15)   Serum sodium 145 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 3.2 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 6.7 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 135 umol/L (60-110)   Serum creatine kinase 178 U/L (24-170)   Fasting plasma glucose 8.7 mmol/L (3-6)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cervical myelopathy,Circumflex neuropathy,Inclusion body myositis,Motor neurone disease,Steroid-induced myopathy,A,"This patient has a cervical myelopathy, most likely as a result of her rheumatoid arthritis. The likely level is C5/C6 given that there is weakness of the deltoid, biceps and supinator and the supinator jerk is inverted. She also has long tract signs in her legs with hypertonia and hyperreflexia. A circumflex neuropathy would account for the weakness and fasciculations of the deltoid, but would not explain the upper motor neurone signs in the legs, or weakness of the biceps and supinator. Inclusion body myositis, an inflammatory myopathy, would present with bilateral often asymmetrical weakness, which has a tendency to affect distal musculature. The tendon reflexes would be normal and the creatine kinase would be normal or mildly elevated. Motor neurone disease presents with upper and lower motor signs in absence of sensory disturbance. A steroid induced myopathy would cause proximal weakness and wasting with normal reflexes and sensation."
urinary system,306,Which of the following is suggestive of genuine stress incontinence (GSI)?,Constant wetness,Dysuria,Haematuria,Passage of large amounts of urine,Prolapse,E,"With genuine stress incontinence the patient often reports loss of urine with physical activity. These activities include coughing, sneezing, climbing stairs, laughing, bouncing, and intercourse. Urine loss is instantaneous and is often described as a 'squirt' of urine. In detrusor dyssynergia (DD) urgency follows physical activity or occurs while at rest. The urge is then followed by a large loss of urine. Dysuria indicates either an infection of the bladder and urethra, or of the vulval and perineal epithelium which is irritated by the dribbling of urine. GSI is often associated with other pelvic relaxation problems, for example, cystocele, rectocele, and uterine prolapse."

The findings that should lead to the diagnosis being made are:  Two or more unilateral or bilateral cysts in individuals between 15 and 30 years of age Two cysts in each kidney in individuals 30 to 59 years Four cysts in each kidney in individuals 60 years or older.  These have a specificity of 100% with respect to diagnosis of the condition. Among patients aged between 15 and 30 years, sensitivity is 95%, and at age 20 years the false-negative rate is said to be 4%. By age 30 years, sensitivity increases to close to 100%; therefore, at this age the condition can definitely be excluded. Screening at age younger than 15 years is not recommended. Screening is recommended because individuals may be asked to become kidney donors for other family members, and early and aggressive management of hypertension in affected individuals may delay the onset of end-stage renal failure."
urinary system,308,Which of these renal stones are radiolucent?,Cystine,Oxalate,Silicate,Urea,Xanthine,E,"Urate and xanthine stones are radiolucent. Radiopaque stones include calcium oxalate, cystine and silicate stones."
urinary system,309,"A 20-year-old man presents to the Emergency department after punching a window. He has lacerated the medial aspect of his wrist, damaging the ulnar nerve. What is he at risk of developing?",Claw hand,Inability to pinch paper between his thumb and index finger,Loss of sensation over the lateral three and a half fingers,Wasting of the second lumbrical muscle,Wasting of the thenar eminence,A,"Ulnar nerve damage at the wrist results in wasting of the intrinsic hand muscles (other than the lateral two lumbricals) and the hypothenar eminence. This produces the classic claw hand. It supplies sensation to the medial one and a half fingers. The median nerve innervates the lateral two lumbricals and the thenar eminence (oppenens pollicis, abductor pollicis and flexor policis brevis). It supplies sensation to the lateral three and a half fingers. Damage to the motor branch, the anterior interosseous nerve results in inability to form and pinch grip, tip to tip, instead holding the paper between the pulp of the thumb and index finger."
urinary system,310,"In pregnancy, how should a UTI be treated?",Cefalexin,Encourage increased water intake,Amoxicillin,Trimethoprim,No treatment required,A,In pregnancy UTIs even if asymptomatic must be treated as there is a high risk of developing pyelonephritis. Cefalexin is safe to use I pregnancy and effective and is a good first line option. Amoxicillin is safe to use in pregnancy however resistance levels are high. Trimethoprim should never be used in pregnancy as it is harmful to the foetus.
urinary system,311,"A 57-year-old woman is referred to the clinic with progressive hearing loss affecting her left ear and tinnitus. She had been diagnosed with Meniere's disease some two years earlier and feels that her problems are slowly getting worse with vertigo and double vision recent additional features. Her GP prescribed some betahistine but it does not seem to be working. On examination her BP is 134/72 mmHg, pulse is 70 and regular, her BMI is 29. There is coarse nystagmus when she looks towards the left, nystagmus is rapid when she looks to the right. There is a deficient corneal reflex on the left. Audiometry reveals significant sensorineural hearing loss affecting the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate next intervention?",Added cyclizine,CT brain,Increased dose of betahistine,MRI brain,Referral for Hallpike manoeuvre,D,"The pattern of nystagmus, slowly progressive symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, and loss of corneal reflex fits best with a diagnosis of acoustic neuroma. As such an MRI brain is the investigation of choice. There is no role for increased medical therapy, betahistine or cyclizine in the management of acoustic neuroma. As such neither of those options is appropriate. CT is not as sensitive as MRI for detection of acoustic neuroma, whereas MRI can detect tumours as small as 1-2 mm, tumours as large as 1.5 cm have been missed on CT. The Hallpike manoeuvre is considered in the diagnosis of benign positional vertigo."
urinary system,312,A 65-year-old female is referred with a long history of hypertension and episodic urinary tract infections. Dipstick analysis of the urine shows blood +++ together with protein +++. Her urea is 20 mmol/L (2.5-7.5) and creatinine is 280 µmol/L (60-110). An ultrasound of abdomen is requested and shows left and right kidneys of 9 cm in size (10-12) without evidence of obstruction. Which one of the following is the best investigation to diagnose the cause of her renal failure?,Isotope renography,IV urography,Renal angiography,Renal biopsy,Retrograde pyelography,D,"This patient has impaired renal function with hypertension and significant proteinuria and haematuria (glomerulonephritis). The kidneys are smaller than expected with no evidence of obstruction. Intravenous urography is not the investigation of choice in a patient with impaired renal function. Isotope renography would provide information about the relative function of each kidney and would show areas of scarring due to renal stone disease, infection, or vascular disease. It would also exclude congenital malformations of the kidneys. Although useful it would not provide information on the cause of the haematuria and proteinuria. Renal angiography is the gold standard for assessing renovascular disease. It is an invasive procedure with potential complications. This investigation would not exclude causes of proteinuria and haematuria. Retrograde pyelography would be useful if there were any evidence of obstruction. The best investigation is a renal biopsy. This would show any changes of glomerulonephritis along with renal scarring from longstanding hypertension or urinary tract infections."
urinary system,313,"A patient is found to have hyperkalaemia, hyperchloraemic acidosis and a urinary pH of 5.0. Given the most likely type of renal tubular acidosis, which of the following treatments is useful?",Fludrocortisone,Bicarbonate,Prednisolone,Nil required,ACE inhibitors,A,"In type 4 renal tubular acidosis there is reduced aldosterone and causes include Addisons, diabetes, SLE and amyloidosis. There is hyperkalaemia differentiating it from the other types and urinary pH is normally low. There is as with the other types hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. Fludrocortisone should be commenced if there is acidosis or hyperkalaemia."
urinary system,314,"You are asked to review a 32-year-old woman on the labour ward. She has just given birth to a healthy female child and was recovering on the ward when the midwives noticed a deterioration in her conscious level and a grand mal seizure which was self-terminating after about five minutes. A few minutes before the seizure they said that she had increasing problems with nausea, vomiting and a severe frontal headache. Apparently there was a short period of hypotension associated with the delivery. On examination she is drowsy with a GCS of 12, her BP is 145/91 mmHg. She has bilateral papilloedema and appears to have bilateral third nerve palsies. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 111 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 5.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 180 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 88 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral venous thrombosis,Embolic stroke,Idiopathic epilepsy,Migraine,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,A,"This woman's symptoms, the onset of which has occurred a few hours after the birth of her child, are suggestive of cerebral venous thrombosis. A number of conditions predispose to the condition, including:  Pregnancy and use of the oral contraceptive pill Inherited coagulation disorders, and Collagen vascular disease.  Signs and symptoms may vary from headache, nausea and vomiting, to a progressive reduction in conscious level and eventual coma. Magnetic resonance venography is extremely valuable in confirming the diagnosis. Anti-coagulation is the treatment of choice even in cases of thrombosis with haemorrhagic transformation. The prodrome prior to seizure is not typical for epilepsy. Migraine, SAH and embolism don't present with papillodema."
urinary system,315,Which of the following is true concerning metastatic calcification in chronic renal failure (CRF)?,Characteristically caused by calcium oxalate deposition,Decreased by vitamin D,Increased prevalence with time on haemodialysis,Rapidly reversed in all sites after parathyroidectomy,Unaffected by time on CAPD,C,"CRF is associated with  Low serum calcium Hyperphosphataemia Increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) Reduced intestinal calcium absorption and Raised alkaline phosphatase.  Parathyroidectomy improves extraskeletal calcification, but vascular calcification improves less than periarticular calcification. Metastatic calcification is due mainly to calcium phosphate deposition, although CRF managed with dialysis is the commonest cause of secondary oxalosis (acute arthritis of small joints with digital calcific deposits). Prolonged treatment with vitamin D (hence hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia) increases extraskeletal calcification."
urinary system,316,"A 74-year-old man comes to the clinic with his wife. He has been suffering from increasingly frequent falls and now has marked problems with his mobility. Past history of note includes an inferior MI and TIA a few years earlier. He has also suffered from two episodes of urinary retention and now has an indwelling catheter. On examination his BP is 142/72 mmHg, with a postural drop of 30 mmHg on standing. He has a quiet ejection systolic murmur, his chest is clear, and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Neurological examination reveals loss of upward gaze, cogwheel rigidity and bradykinesia. He has a mild tremor only. Investigations show    Haemoglobin 128 g/L (135-177)   White cells 5.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 221 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 138 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Idiopathic parkinsonism,Lewy body disease,Multi-infarct disease,Multi-system atrophy,Pick's disease,D,"The particular features of autonomic dysfunction seen here, with postural hypotension and urinary retention, coupled with parkinsonism point towards a diagnosis of multi-system atrophy. The loss of upward gaze is a distractor, which may lead you to consider a diagnosis of supranuclear palsy (which is not an option here). As here, whilst the motor symptoms are parkinsonian in nature, the tremor is often less pronounced than in a patient with idiopathic Parkinson's. The Parkinson's symptoms associated with multi-system atrophy usually respond poorly to dopamine agonists or L-dopa, in contrast to idiopathic Parkinson's. Urinary retention can be managed with an indwelling catheter if required, and postural hypotension managed with support stockings plus mineralocorticoids if required. The other options are unlikely as no cognitive decline is described."
urinary system,317,Which of the following is the feature which indicates pre-renal uraemia ahead of frank acute tubular necrosis (ATN)?,A disproportionate rise in blood creatinine levels,A urinary osmolality of 300 mOsm,Oliguria despite aggressive IV fluid resuscitation,The presence of red cell casts in the urine,Urine sodium of 10 mEq/L,E,"A disproportionate rise in plasma urea compared to creatinine suggests pre-renal failure due to hypovolaemia. Renal failure is partially reversible when adequate renal perfusion is restored. Protein, red blood cells and cellular casts in the urine suggest intrinsic renal disease. A urinary sodium of less than 20 mmol/L is suggestive of pre-renal failure. The kidney reabsorption mechanisms are still working at this stage, whilst they fail in established ATN."
urinary system,318,Frontal lobe brain damage is associated with which of the following?,Astereognosis,Auditory agnosia,Dressing apraxia,Focal epileptic fits,Perseveration,E,"Frontal lobe brain damage is classically associated with personality change and deterioration in intellect, but perseveration may also occur. The lesion for astereognosis and acalculia would be in the parietal lobe and dressing apraxia in the non-dominant parietal lobe. Focal epileptic fits and auditory agnosia are characteristically associated with temporal lobe damage. Apraxia may result from lesions in the temporoparietal cortex, dominant frontal cortex and corpus callosum."
urinary system,319,"A 50-year-old woman is referred with a two week history of difficulty walking and weakness in her arms. On examination, there was proximal and distal limb weakness which was more marked in the legs than the arms. All tendon reflexes were absent and the plantar responses were flexor. There was no sensory loss. Blood pressure in the supine position was 140/78 mmHg (lying) and was 110/70 mmHg on standing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cervical cord compression,Guillain-Barré syndrome,Myasthenia gravis,Poliomyelitis,Polymyositis,B,This is a classical presentation of Guillain-Barre with the gradual development of ascending weakness with autonomic involvement.
urinary system,320,An 80-year-old man comes to the office to be evaluated for difficulty moving and memory problems. On examination he has mask-like facies and a pill-rolling tremor. His gait is bradykinetic. He is unable to look down and has been falling frequently only in the last few months. He is not orthostatic on examination The histopathological changes in this disease are similar to those found in which of the following conditions?,Alzheimer's disease,Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO),Multiple system atrophy (MSA),Prion disease,Tabes dorsalis,A,"The vignette describes a case of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a disease referred to as a andquot;Parkinson plus syndromeandquot;. The stem gives you the point that the patient cannot look down - this is common in progressive supranuclear palsy. It is important to remember that, unlike Parkinson's disease which is predominantly an alpha-synucleinopathy, PSP is a tauopathy similar to Alzheimer's disease. Of the incorrect answer options:  CPEO is a mitochondrial disorder. Multiple system atrophy is an alpha-synucleinopathy. Prion disease has spongiform changes. Tabes dorsalis is a result of inflammation from a syphilis infection."
urinary system,321,A 55-year-old man presents with a right sided rest tremor and slowness of movement. A year ago he noticed that he could not smell his food. He has not had any falls and his eye movements are normal. His past medical history is unremarkable and he does not take any medication. Which of the following structures is most likely to be most affected?,Left cerebellar hemisphere,Left cerebral neocortex,Olfactory nerve,Red nucleus,Substantia nigra,E,"The diagnosis is most likely idiopathic Parkinson's disease. The patient has a pre-motor symptom of olfactory disturbance and fulfils the UK-PDS brain bank criteria for Parkinson's disease. He is developing motor symptoms due to loss of more than 50% of the dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra. Left cerebellar hemisphere is incorrect because there are no cerebellar signs (he has normal eye movements and no nystagmus). Left cerebral neocortex is incorrect as lesions of the outermost layer of the cerebral cortex present with problems of memory, attention and consciousness. Olfactory nerve is incorrect as isolated lesions of the olfactory nerve would not present with tremor. Red nucleus is incorrect as the red nucleus is responsible for motor coordination of the upper arm and shoulder. Loss of dopaminergic neurones in the substantia nigra is predominantly responsible for the symptoms in Parkinson's disease. "
urinary system,322,"A 60-year-old male presents with typical renal colic and one day later passes a small stone. However, the original x ray of the abdomen revealed no obvious calculi. What is the most likely composition of his calculus?",Calcium,Cystine,Oxalate,Phosphate,Uric acid,E,"The main constituent will be uric acid. Major causes of stone formation:  Calcium stones (80%) - hypercalciuria (for example, primary hyperparathyroidism), hyperoxaluria (for example, XS intake, ileal disease and bypass) Uric acid stones (10%) - high purine intake, high cell turnover Cystine stones (2%) - cystinuria ( AR defect in dibasic amino acid transporter) Infection stones (5%) - chronic infection with urea splitting organisms causes stones made of magnesium ammonium phosphate and calcium phosphate Other stones (3%) - include xanthine stones, rare renal chloride channel mutations can cause stone formation.  There appears to be a male predominance with a 2:1 ratio. Calcium and infection stones are radio-opaque, cystine stones are weakly radio-opaque and urate stones are radiolucent."
urinary system,323,A 46-year-old homosexual HIV positive man presents with a two-week history of weakness of his right arm and leg. Examination reveals right hemiparesis and left cerebellar signs. CT scan shows white matter lesions in the left cerebellar region and left temporoparietal area. There is no midline shift or surrounding oedema. Which one of the following is most likely to be found in his cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?,Positive cytomegalovirus (CMV) PCR,Positive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) PCR,Positive herpes simplex virus (HSV) PCR,Positive human herpes virus (HHV) 8 PCR,Positive JC PCR,E,Multifocal lesions in left cerebellar and temporoparietal white matter areas without any mass effect or surrounding oedema are most likely to be due to progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (PML). JC virus causes PML in immunocompromised patients especially when the CD4 count is below 100 cells/mm^3. CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) may be found in CMV encephalitis. It is clinically not a typical feature of CMV encephalitis. Positive EBV PCR indicates primary brain lymphoma where CT scan often shows significant mass effect with surrounding oedema. HSV PCR may be found in HSV encephalitis which commonly affects temporal lobes in patients with good CD4 count. HHV 8 PCR is usually associated with Kaposi's sarcoma.
urinary system,324,"A 49-year-old woman is referred to the Emergency Department with worsening renal function and two episodes of haemoptysis (a teacup full each time) over the past 24 hours. She has been seen on a number of occasions by the GP with fevers, arthralgia, and a rash over the past four months. She takes no regular medication. On examination her BP is 152/90, pulse is 85 and regular. You note livedo reticularis and a purpuric rash affecting both legs. There is wheeze on auscultation of the chest, O2 saturation on air is 92%. Investigations:    Hb 104g/l 115-160   WCC 10.9x10^9/l 6-10   PLT 142 x 10^9/l 150-400   Na 140 mmol/l 135-145   K 5.1 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 212 µmol/l(112 µmol/l4m prior) 50-90   ESR 72 mm/hr less than10   CRP 112 mg/dl less than10   ANA positive   MPO ANCA positive    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Goodpasture's syndrome,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Microscopic polyangiitis,Mixed connective tissue disease,Systemic lupus erythematosus,C,"The answer is microscopic polyangiitis. The picture of worsening renal function, coupled with haemoptysis, chest signs and a purpuric rash is consistent with microscopic polyangiitis. MPO ANCA positivity further supports the diagnosis. PR3 ANCA is more consistent with a granulomatous polyangiitis such as Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (which classically presents with sinusitis/nasal congestion). Biopsy is important in establishing the diagnosis, with the skin lesions an obvious initial source of tissue. Anti-GBM antibodies are associated with Goodpasture's syndrome, in which more rapid renal dysfunction and more marked pulmonary haemorrhage would be more classic. Mixed connective tissue disease combines features of systemic sclerosis, myositis, SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and therefore the symptoms described here would not be classical."
urinary system,325,A 30-year-old female presents with fevers and a three-month history of malaise. Results show:    Creatinine 250 µmol/L (60-110)   Complement C3 23 mg/dL (65-190)   Urinalysis Protein +   Blood +    Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,HIV nephropathy,Infective endocarditis,Membranous nephropathy,Microscopic polyangiitis,Minimal change nephropathy,B,"Hypocomplementaemia is associated with either vasculitides such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and cryoglobulinaemia but is also associated with a non-vasculitic process such as subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE). Subacute bacterial endocarditis more commonly affects the patient with an underlying valve lesions but can affect patients with no known cardiac problems. IV drug use, intravenous lines (such as Hickman), dental procedures, genitourinary procedures, colonic neoplasms, and cardiac surgery all increase the risk but patients with no known risk factors can also be affected. The history is often long, with vague symptoms and it is therefore important to have high suspicion where it is a possible diagnosis. The classic signs of subacute infective endocarditis are: petechiae of the mucous membranes, splinter haemorrhages beneath the nails, Osler's nodes and Janeway lesions of the hands, and Roth spots in the retina. It is also possible to have focal neurological deficit, due to cerebral emboli. The murmur is most commonly regurgitant. Patients usually present with viral-type symptoms, such as fever, sweats, anorexia, arthralgia, malaise, pallor, and non-productive cough. At least three sets of blood cultures should be taken from separate sites on consecutive days, prior to giving antibiotics (unless the patient is septic). FBC commonly shows a leucocytosis, with normochromic normocytic anaemia and elevated ESR. Urinalysis shows proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. C3 complement is usually decreased, and rheumatoid factor may be possible. Transthoracic echocardiogram can demonstrate valve vegetations, although transoesophageal (TOE) is more sensitive. If subacute infective endocarditis is confirmed, the management is with IV antibiotics for 4-6 weeks. These classically start broad spectrum, but you should narrow the cover once an organism is identified (usually from blood cultures). Surgery is indicated in fungal endocarditis, prosthetic valve involvement, persistently positive blood cultures despite therapy, recurrent emboli, valve ring or myocardial abscess, heart failure, and large vegetations. Antibiotic prophylaxis is controversial, and you should read the most up to date guidelines prior to your exam. HIV nephropathy usually presents with nephrotic range proteinuria, and is, therefore, less likely in this case where there is only one plus of protein in the urine. Membranous nephropathy is usually idiopathic but can be secondary to SLE, hepatitis B, malignancy, gold, or penicillamine. Again, it typically presents with nephrotic syndrome making it less likely in this case.  In microscopic polyangiitis, which is classically small vessel, complement would be expected to be normal. Minimal change nephropathy again presents with nephrotic syndrome."
urinary system,326,A 35-year-old woman is referred with right eye pain that has deteriorated over the last week. On examination she had a mild ptosis of the right eye and was aware of diplopia with vertical image separation on looking upwards. She also had weakness of elevation of the right eye and the pupil was slightly larger compared to the left. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cavernous sinus thrombosis,Graves’ ophthalmopathy,Myasthenia gravis,Posterior communicating artery aneurysm ,Sphenoid sinusitis ,D,"The signs are consistent with a unilateral partial third nerve palsy associated with periorbital pain. Of the options given, a posterior communicating artery aneurysm is the one which can present with an isolated painful third nerve palsy with pupillary involvement (a 'surgical third' - suggestive of external compression). With cavernous sinus thrombosis one should expect some other signs such as periorbital swelling, proptosis, and conjuctival injection. Graves' eye disease is associated with proptosis and lid retraction and is usually bilateral. Myasthenia gravis does not classically present with pain, and the signs are bilateral and are predominantly associated with fatigue. Sphenoid sinusitis is usually associated with facial pain, and systemic signs of infection. There is normally chemosis and may be proptosis and a seventh nerve palsy. Involvement of the third cranial nerve is less common."
urinary system,327,What is this flow pattern most likely to be associated with?,Detrusor overactivity,Urodynamic stress incontinence,Cystocele,Urinary tract infection,Urethral stricture,C,This uroflometry pattern represents obstruction. The flow is prolonged and associated with a reduced Qmax.Cystocele can cause obstruction through kinking of the urethra.Detusor overactivity or urodynamic stress incontinence should not affect the flow pattern. A stricture typically produces a plateau pattern of flow.
urinary system,328,"A 59-year-old man with chronic renal failure comes to the surgery complaining of tiredness and lethargy. He has a long-standing history of type 1 diabetes and takes a range of medications. On examination, his BP is 145/84 mmHg. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 94 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 6.4 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 162 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 5.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 219 μmol/L (60-120)   Ferritin 10 µg/L (20-60)   Faecal occult blood Negative   Urine Protein ++    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Erythropoietin,IV iron transfusion,Oral ferrous sulphate,Referral for lower GI endoscopy,Referral for upper GI endoscopy,B,"The causes of anaemia in haemodialysis patients are numerous. Firstly, there is insufficient production of erythropoietin (EPO) and, secondly, iron deficiency is present in most. The tubing of dialysis equipment causes continued low-level blood loss, there may be chronic inflammation any other vitamin deficiencies (or folic acid) and gastrointestinal absorption of iron is often reduced. In addition, uraemic toxins can inhibit erythropoiesis, and it appears there is shortened red cell survival in chronic renal failure (possibly due to haemolysis). If left untreated, the anaemia of chronic kidney disease is associated with deterioration in cardiac function, increased risk of stroke, decreased cognition and mental acuity and fatigues. Treating anaemia in these patients markedly improves quality of life, and decreases morbidity and mortality. There is unlikely to be a gastrointestinal source of bleeding in this case, especially as faecal occult blood is negative.  The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and European Revised Evidence-Based Practice 2004 Guidelines recommend:  Haemoglobin 105-125 g/L Ferritin: greater than100 μg/L in pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, greater than200 μg/L in haemodialysis patients Transferrin saturation greater than20%  It is imperative that renal patients avoid repeated blood transfusion, unless in extremis, so that future renal transplantation will not be precluded by allo-sensitisation. Before initiation of recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents the patient should be replete in B12, folate and iron. The serum ferritin and transferrin saturation should be checked, as most patients will be iron deficient. If any are found to be low they should be replaced. The intravenous route of replacement is preferred in patients found to be significantly iron deficient, as in this case. Once iron stores are restored and ferritin is in the normal range, if the patient is still anaemic then erythropoietin would be the next appropriate option. Please note that this answer remains correct whether the patient is receiving dialysis or not. The difference is you have a different target of ferritin if they are pre-dialysis, as stated above. "
urinary system,329,"A 65-year-old woman has a one month history of malaise, weight loss, right sided pain around the eye and headaches. She has also noticed intermittent diplopia. Five years previously she had a mastectomy for carcinoma of the breast.

He is really very upset and complains that he has no recollection about what has happened that day and has no idea at all how he suddenly got to the supermarket with his wife. He has a history of hypertension for which he takes ramipril, and he takes aspirin 75 mg on the advice of his doctor, but has no other significant past medical history. On examination is BP is well controlled at 135/75 mmHg, his pulse is 70 and regular. Neurological examination is normal and he behaves appropriately when asked to perform set tasks.

The cause of transient global amnesia is unknown but it may be related to a migrainous phenomenon or transient ischaemia. It is claimed that the condition may be associated with neuronal loss in the hippocampal area or abnormal metabolism by neurones in this area leading to build up of lactate, but definitive proof does not exist. No specific therapy for the condition is required; specifically no increased use of anti-platelet agents is needed."
urinary system,331,"A 45 year old patient has been recently diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. He presents with bilateral swelling of his legs up to his knees. This is slightly worse on the left than the right. Bloods reveal a slightly raised creatinine, hypoalbuminaemia and a cholesterol of 10.0 mmol/l. A 24 hour urinary protein reveals a proteinuria of 5.0 g. An ultrasound revealed a left DVT and normal kidneys. The peripheral oedema and proteinuria responds to steroids. A renal ultrasound is normal. What would you expect to find on renal biopsy?",Retraction of the epithelial foot processes on electron microscopy,IgG and complement deposition in mesangium,Segmental sclerosis,Small deposits in subepithelial area of capillary walls on electron microscopy,Glomerular basement membrane thinning,A,"This patient has nephrotic syndrome which is characterised by proteinuria (nephrotic range), peripheral oedema, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperlipidaemia. There is increased risk of infections and thrombosis due to loss of immunoglobulin and anti thrombin III in the urine. One of the most common cause is minimal change disease. The diagnosis here is hinted at by the normal renal ultrasound. Minimal change disease can be secondary to infectious mononucleosis, certain drugs such as NSAIDs and malignancy, most commonly Hodgkins disease. On renal biopsy the glomeruli appear normal on light microscopy and there is retraction of epithelial foot processes on electron microscopy."

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Central retinal vein occlusion,Closed angle glaucoma,Giant cell arteritis,Optic neuritis,Raised intracranial pressure,C,The presence of a swollen optic disc suggests ischaemic optic neuropathy. In elderly people giant cell arteritis is a common presentation of acute monocular visual loss. Optic neuritis is very rare in people over the age of 50. You would expect bilateral swollen optic discs in raised intracranial pressure. In central retinal vein occlusion you would expect diffuse retinal haemorrhages.
urinary system,334,"A 50 year old lady with symptoms of mixed incontinence has urodynamics after failed pelvic floor muscle training and a trial of anticholinergics. What findings of Pves, Pdet and Pabd indicate a diagnosis of urodynamic stress incontinence?",Sharp rises in Pves and Pabd without rise in Pdet with no leakage of urine on coughing,"Peaks of pressure rise in Pves, Pdet and Pabd on coughing with leaking",Peaks of pressure rise in Pves and Pdet but not in Pabd in filling phase,Absence of peaks of pressure rise on running taps,Sharp rises in Pves and Pabd without rise in Pdet with leakage of urine on coughing,E,"Urodynamics findings in peaks of pressure rise in Pves and Pdet but not in Pabd in filling phase means a diagnosis of detrusor overactivity, sharp rises in Pves and Pabd without rise in Pdet with no leakage of urine on coughing shows a stable bladder with no USI (normal). Sharp rises in Pves and Pabd without rise in Pdet with leakage of urine on coughing show that the sharp rise in Pves is due to rise in Pabd due to coughing and leakage is consistent with the diagnosis of USI.Absence of peaks of pressure rise on running taps signifies stable bladder and Peaks of pressure rise in Pves, Pdet and Pabd on coughing with leaking shows a diagnosis of cough induced detrusor overactivity as there is peak of pressure rise in Pdet with leaking."
urinary system,335,Which one of the following is true concerning antidiuretic hormone (ADH)?,Carbamazepine potentiates its release,Ethanol potentiates its release,It circulates in the blood bound to neurohypophysis,It is a cyclic octapeptide,It is synthesised from the anterior pituitary,A,"ADH is a nonapeptide manufactured in the paraventricular and supra-optic nuclei of the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary not the anterior. It acts on the collecting ducts improving water permeability and hence water retention. Carbamazepine, as well as other agents such as thiazides and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may potentiate its release. Ethanol usually inhibits release."
urinary system,336,"A 70-year-old female patient presents with two months' history of apathy, withdrawal, urinary and faecal incontinence and anosmia. Which of the following is the most likely anatomical site of the neurological lesion?",Frontal lobe,Internal capsule,Occipital lobe,Parietal lobe,Temporal lobe,A,"Frontal lobe syndrome usually presents with  Personality changes Urinary and faecal incontinence Anosmia Expressive dysphasia (dominant lobe) Release of primitive reflexes (positive grasp, pout and palmomental reflexes) and Epilepsy.  Fifty percent of patients presenting with status epilepticus (with no previous history of seizures) have frontal lobe tumour. It can mimic dementia."
urinary system,337,A 25-year-old female wishes to start a family but she is concerned as her 50-year-old mother had adult polycystic kidney disease. Examination reveals no specific abnormalities. Which is the most appropriate initial screening test for polycystic kidney disease in this woman?,Genetic linkage analysis,Intravenous urogram,Isotope renography,Renal ultrasound,Urinalysis,D,"The answer lies between renal ultrasound and genetic linkage analysis. Polycystic kidney disease is an autosomal dominant disorder. Mutations in at least three different genes can lead to autosomal dominant polycystic disease (APKD).  PKD-1 on chromosome 16: 85% of cases. Polycystin 1 is an integral membrane glycoprotein involved in cell/matrix interactions PKD-2 on chromosome 4: 10% of cases. Polycystin 2 which may associate with polycystin 1 through a common signalling pathway A third gene mutation is known but its exact chromosomal location is not.  Diagnosis is made by multiple bilateral renal cysts and a positive family history. Genetic linkage studies can exclude or make the diagnosis in younger patients. The studies require blood from at least two affected family members. Ultrasonography:  In PKD 1 families, age-related diagnostic criteria are used: two cysts in under 30 years age group. At least two cysts in each kidney in 30-59 years. Four cysts in each kidney for over 60 years.  CT is more sensitive than USS and may aid in diagnosis in younger patients. MR angiography is used to screen for cerebral aneurysms in patients with a family history of an intracranial aneurysm."
urinary system,338,"A 70-year-old man presents with difficulty speaking. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination the patient is awake, his blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg. His pulse is irregularly irregular. He has 4/5 strength in the right arm and leg and 5/5 strength on the left. When asked to point to the window he does this correctly. When told to raise his arms and place his hands out he is seen to have a pronator drift on the right. He is shown a pen and asked what it is. His answer is unintelligible. He is asked to use it appropriately and begins to write on a piece of paper perfectly. When asked to repeat andquot;Today is a sunny dayandquot;, he attempts it but appears severely dysarthric and cannot be understood. To what does this type of dysphasia localise? ",Aphemia,Fluent aphasia,Non-fluent aphasia,Transcortical motor aphasia,Transcortical sensory aphasia,A,"In Wernicke's or fluent or receptive aphasia the patient is able to form correct grammatical sentences but language content is incorrect. It localises to the dominant superior temporal gyrus. There is poor comprehension and repetition but verbal output is fluent. In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In transcortical motor aphasia, which localises to the anterior superior frontal lobe, the patient is has good comprehension and repetition but has halting, effortful speech. Patients also have impaired writing skills. Transcortical sensory aphasia is characterised by impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech, and is caused by damage to the temporal lobes. It differs from Wernicke's aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition, and exhibit cholalia (the compulsive repetition of words). Improvement may be seen with speech therapy. Aphemia is what is described in this case. It is a type of aphasia in which there is severe dysarthria and impairment of verbal output. There is intact comprehension. It is believed to be the result of pars opercularis, inferior pre-Rolandic gyrus or subcortical lesions."
urinary system,339,A 90-year-old lady attends the Emergency department with a dense disabling hemiplegia affecting her left arm and leg. She is hemiplegic and confused. A CT scan confirms that there is a right CVA. Carotid scanning shows stenosis of 75% on the right and 90% on the left. What is the best course of action?,Admit but no surgical intervention,Bilateral carotid endarterectomy,Discharge and GP follow up,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the left,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the right,A,"This patient has a symptomatic carotid stenosis on the right that would be appropriate for surgery if this were a TIA or resolving stroke. Unfortunately, with dense strokes, if there is no recovery, the benefits are greatly reduced due to end-organ damage. Revascularisation would have the risk of reperfusion haemorrhage. The benefit of endarterectomy is prevention of future stroke."
urinary system,340,A 45 year old who has a past medical history of gout presents with severe loin to groin pain. He states the pain is severe and he is very restless with it. You suspect renal however an AXR does not reveal any evidence of stones. Urinalysis reveals blood and protein. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pyelonephritis,Struvite stones,Calcium Oxalate stones,Uric acid renal stones,Urinary Tract Infection,D,The history is indicative of renal stones. Uric acid stones are radiolucent and this would explain the lack of evidence on an AXR. It is also suggested by the history of gout.
urinary system,341,"A 60 year old male is noted to have macroglossia, hepatomegaly and has waxy papules in the eyelids, neck and groin. He complains of symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome. He has now developed oedema and is found to have nephrotic syndrome. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Scleroderma,Minimal change disease,Hypercholesterolaemia,Amyloidosis,Glomerulonephritis,D,"The macroglossia, hepatomegaly, skin lesions and carpal tunnel syndrome are typical of primary amyloidosis. This can lead to the nephrotic syndrome. It can affect other organs such as the heart. On biopsy there would be deposits which show green birefringence after staining with congo red."
urinary system,342,"A 45 year old patient has been recently diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma. He presents with bilateral swelling of his legs up to his knees. This is slightly worse on the left than the right. Bloods reveal a slightly raised creatinine, hypoalbuminaemia and a cholesterol of 10.0 mmol/l. A 24 hour urinary protein reveals a proteinuria of 5.0 g. An ultrasound revealed a left DVT and normal kidneys. The peripheral oedema and proteinuria responds to steroids. A renal ultrasound is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Membranous Nephropathy,Thrombophilia,Minimal Change Disease,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,IgA nephropathy,C,"This patient has nephrotic syndrome which is characterised by proteinuria (nephrotic range), peripheral oedema, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperlipidaemia. There is increased risk of infections and thrombosis due to loss of immunoglobulin and anti thrombin III in the urine. One of the most common cause is minimal change disease. The diagnosis here is hinted at by the normal renal ultrasound. Minimal change disease can be secondary to infectious mononucleosis, certain drugs such as NSAIDs and malignancy, most commonly Hodgkins disease. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is one of the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults however often on ultrasound there is increased kidney size with echogenicity and it is not commonly associated with hodgkins lymphoma. Membranous nephropathy does not typically respond to steroids with no improvement in proteinuria or renal function."
urinary system,343,A 36-year-old male is referred with chronic renal dysfunction and is discovered to have adult polycystic kidney disease. Which of the following proteins is associated with the development of APKD?,Cyst specific binding protein,Matrix metalloproteinase,Polycystin-1,Progesterone binding cyst-protein,Type 1 collagen,C,"Autosomal dominant APKD-1 is a relatively common disorder accounting for approximately 8% of cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Eighty-five percent of cases are due to the defect in PKD-1 locus on chromosome 16p13.3. PKD-1 encodes a large protein, polycystin, which seems to be involved in cell to cell-matrix interaction. "
urinary system,344,A 24-year-old man presents with painless hematuria. No other complaint and no abnormality is found on physical exam. What is the most appropriate initial investigation which is helpful to get a diagnosis?,Coagulation screening,MSU,Cystoscopy,MRI spine,Abdominal US,E,Painless hematuria in a young male without any other findings on history or examination often suggests Polycystic Kidney Disease
urinary system,345,"A 47-year-old man presents with proteinuria +, BP 160/95 mmHg, small kidneys that have smooth renal pelvis. What is the most probable diagnosis?",GN (glomerulonephritis),Chronic pyelonephritis,Unilateral renal artery stenosis,Multiple myeloma,ARF (acute renal failure),A,In chr. Pyelonephritis US will demonstrate renal scarring and urinalysis will demonstrate pyuria which are absent here. In unilateral renal artery stenosis there will be considerable difference in kidney size from one another which is not found here. Here likely diagnosis is GN
urinary system,346,A 42-year-old woman with a past medical history of severe headache treated in the emergency department presents with signs and symptoms of renal failure. She has been seen by her GP for hypertension and abdominal pain with outpatient investigations pending. Which investigation is most likely to lead to a diagnosis?,US KUB,CT brain,IVU,Renal artery Doppler,Renal biopsy,A,"Hypertension, abdominal pain and features of renal failure indicates the diagnosis of ADPKD for which the diagnosis is best made by US KUB"
urinary system,347,"A 3 year old is brought to the GP as she is thought to be drinking and urinating excessively by her parents. She has recently began wetting the bed again after being potty trained last year. She appears very small for her age. Bloods reveal renal impairment, urinalysis normal and an ultrasound is organised. On ultrasound the kidneys appear small and there is evidence of multiple small medullary cysts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Nephronophthisis,Posterior urethral valve,Medullary sponge kidney,Polycystic kidney disease,Chronic pyelonephritis,A,Nephronophthisis is the most likely diagnosis as it presents in this way with the ultrasound findings being indicative. It is an autosomal recessive disorder and leads to chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis leading to multiple cysts in medulla and at corticomedullary junction. It is thought to be due to dysfunction of cilia. Medullary sponge kidney does not lead to small kidneys and tends to present later in life. Similarly polycystic kidney disease presents late in life. Posterior urethral valve tends to lead to obstructive symptoms and there is no evidence of infection in urinalysis.
urinary system,348,"A 78-year-old gentleman is admitted with diarrhoea, recent onset of atrial fibrillation, acute renal failure and abdominal pain. Some of his laboratory parameters are shown below:    Sodium 146 mmol/L (135-145)   Potassium 3 mmol/L (3.5-5.0)   Bicarbonate 14 mmol/L (24-30)   Chloride 95 mmol/L (95-105)   Urea 30 mmol/L (2.5-6.5)    What is the anion gap of this patient?",24,30,40,45,48,C,The anion gap is an estimate of the unmeasured anions in the serum and helps to differentiate the causes of metabolic acidosis. The anion gap is calculated by the sum of the positive ions in the blood (mainly sodium and potassium) from which is subtracted the sum of the negative ions (chloride and bicarbonate). This is described by the following formula:  ([Na+] + [K+]) − ([Cl−] + [HCO3−]) (146 + 3) − (14 + 95) = 40 The normal range is 3-11.  This gentleman has a significantly raised anion gap possibly secondary to ischaemic bowel and lactic acid production. Note that the serum urea is not involved in the calculation of the anion gap.
urinary system,349,A 32-year-old scientist presents to the Emergency department with a right facial weakness. He has recently returned from a conference in the USA. There is no history of systemic illness but on examination he has mild neck stiffness and a painful right wrist and knee with a right facial palsy. Investigations were as follows:    Hb 120 g/L (130-180)   WCC 7 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 190 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Clotting Normal   ESR 32 mm/1^st hour (0-15)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 6.9 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 76 µmol/L (60-110)   Calcium and LFTs Normal   CXR Normal   CT head Normal   CSF: Protein 1.2 g (0.15-0.45)   CSF: WCC 67 (97% lymphocytes)   CSF No organisms seen    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Behçet's disease,HIV associated neuropathy,Lyme disease,Sarcoidosis,Tuberculous meningitis,C,"All the answers are possible causes of a facial palsy. The high protein and lymphocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) imply an acute or sub-acute infective process. Neurosarcoidosis is thus unlikely. The main clinical features of Behçet's are not present - orogenital ulceration, iritis and pathergy. HIV is usually associated with a peripheral sensory neuropathy. TB meningitis is likely to lead to a generalised systemic illness. The fact that the patient has recently been to America and has a unilateral facial palsy makes Lyme disease the most likely diagnosis. Lyme disease is spread by the bite of ticks of the genus Ixodes that are infected with Borrelia burgdorferi."
urinary system,350,A 16-year-old boy is admitted after a blackout at the dentist. His mother describes how he blacked out as the dentist began performing a filling and that he jerked his arms a few times and was then incontinent. He awoke after a minute or so and was oriented but nauseated. There have been no similar episodes in the past and he is totally unaware of what happened. Examination is normal and his ECG is normal. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Complex partial seizure,Pseudoseizure,Stokes-Adams attack,Tonic-clonic seizure,Vasovagal syncope,E,"Vasovagal syncope is common during dental procedures, mainly induced by pain (as the dentist started drilling). The fact that he recovered very quickly supports the diagnosis of syncope. It is common to have jerking of limbs due to brain hypoxia. ECG is always normal. Incontinence of urine can occur, but not biting of the tongue."
urinary system,351,"A 16-year-old boy presented to the ER with seizures. An emergency CT scan revealed a calcified ring in the right parietal cortex. The on-call neurologist recommended starting oral antiepileptic drugs (AED) after stabilization. However, the boy's parents said that he has a metallic heart valve and is on regular warfarin 7.5 mg/day. Which is the best oral AED in this situation?",Levetiracetam,Carbamazepine,Phenytoin,Phenobarbital,Valproate,A,The boy is receiving warfarin. Warfarin and other oral anticoagulants are notorious for drug interactions and anti-epileptics must be prescribed with caution. The interaction can alter drug action of both AED as well as anti-coagulants. Levetiracetam is a drug with least interactions and is safest here. Carbamazepine increases metabolism of warfarin and reduces its blood levels so the anticoagulant efficacy may be decreased. The interaction of warfarin with phenytoin is complex. It is unpredictable and may involve an increase or decrease of activity of warfarin. This is also an enzyme inducer; it will decrease blood levels of warfarin. Valproate inhibits warfarin metabolism and increases blood levels and there may be bleeding. 
urinary system,352,A 39-year-old woman is found to have absent ankle jerks and gait disturbance. Which of the following investigations is not indicated?,ANA,B12 levels,Cholestanol levels,Ferritin,VDRL,D,"Absent ankle jerks may occur in conditions associated with neuropathy (B12 deficiency, systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis) and dorsal root disease (tabes dorsalis). Gait disturbance may occur for a variety of reasons:  Sensory ataxia in B12 deficiency and tabes dorsalis Pyramidal signs in B12 deficiency and SLE Cerebellar ataxia in cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis.  Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is an inherited condition, associated with accumulation of cholesterol in tissues including brain, peripheral nerve and tendons which produces a clinical picture of:  Early onset dementia Gait ataxia Loss of vibration sense Cataracts Large tendon xanthomata.  It is eminently treatable by the oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid. To clarify option 3, cholestanol is a derivative of cholesterol. In cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis there is a deficiency in sterol storage, and diagnosis is based on high serum (and tendon) cholesTANOL. Serum cholesterol may be normal or low."
urinary system,353,"A 68-year-old gentleman with Parkinson's disease on donepezil and L-dopa presents with increasing agitation, inability to perform simple tasks, fluctuating consciousness, visual hallucinations, and memory loss over a period of six months. An MRI shows enlarged lateral ventricles as well as hypothalamic atrophy. Dementia with Lewy bodies is diagnosed. Which pathological changes would you expect in this condition?",Alpha synuclein accumulation,Beta amyloid plaque formation,Micro-aneursyms and infarcts.,Pick body formation,Tau tangle formation,A,"Dementia with Lewy bodies shares characteristics with Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and is the second most common form of dementia in the UK behind Alzheimer's. It predominantly affects patients aged between 50-70 and MRI is the diagnostic imaging of choice. It is caused by accumulation of the protein Alpha-synuclein in the brain. Although already present in abundance in the brain, it is not until alpha-synuculein is in its insoluble form that it begins to form lewy bodies and result in dementia with Lewy bodies. Tau tangle and beta amyloid plaque formation are pathological changes characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. Micro-aneurysms and infarcts are the cause of vascular dementia which classically presents with stepwise cognitive decline. Pick bodies can be seen in Pick's disease, a form of fronto-temporal dementia."
urinary system,354,Which of these is not an absolute contraindication to extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy?,Obstruction distal to stone,Hypertension,Coagulopathy,Pregnancy,Urosepsis,B,All are absolute contraindications except hypertension which is a relative contraindication.
urinary system,355,Against which of the following is the specific antibody found in neuromyelitis optica?,Aquaporin 4,Glial fibrillary acidic protein,Myelin basic protein,Oligoclonal bands,Transthyretin,A,Neuromyelitis optica is a demyelinating disease involving the optic nerves and spinal cord but sparing the brain. The specific test for this is the NMO antibody which is against aquaporin 4. Myelin basic protein is elevated in demyelinating disease and is non-specific. Oligoclonal bands are elevated in inflammatory responses and again are non-specific. Glial fibrillary acidic protein is used to stain glial cells in immunohistochemistry. Transthyretin mutations are seen in amyloidosis.
urinary system,356,"A patient is found to have hypokalaemia, hyperchloraemic acidosis, hypercalciuria and a urinary pH of 6.4. What type of renal tubular acidosis does this indicate?",Does not indicate renal tubular acidosis,Type 1,Type 4,Type 2,Type 3,B,"Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is an inability to form acid urine in the distal tubule. It can be secondary to autoimmune diseases. There is hypokalaemia, hypercholaraemic metabolic acidosis, urinary pH of above 6 and hypercalciuria. Hypercalciuria can lead to renal stone formation. In type 2 there is defective secretion of hydrogen ions and bicarbonate reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Hypokalaemia and hyperchloraemic acidosis is observed but the pH can be less than 6 and hypercalciuria is not a feature. In type 4 there is reduced aldosterone and causes include Addisons, diabetes, SLE and amyloidosis. There is hyperkalaemia differentiating it from the other types and urinary pH is normally low. There is as with the other types hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis. Type 3 no longer exists and is thought to be a combination of type 1 and type 2."
urinary system,357,A 45-year-old man presents with an insidious onset of binocular horizontal diplopia and left sided facial pain. On examination he has a left abducens nerve palsy and numbness over the maxillary division of the left trigeminal nerve. Of the following which is the most likely anatomical site of his neurological lesion?,Cavernous sinus,Cerebellopontine angle,Midbrain,Petrous apex,Superior orbital fissure,D,"In the pre-antibiotic era an abducens nerve palsy with ipsilateral pain and numbness was due to petrous osteitis (Gradenigo syndrome) but is now more likely the result of a meningioma or nasopharyngeal carcinoma of the petrous apex. Facial pain or sensory disturbance in the trigeminal nerve distribution can occur with a petrous apex lesion, and occurs secondary to involvement of the trigeminal nerve at the Meckel cave.  The cavernous sinus syndrome consists of variable involvement of  Oculomotor (III) Trochlear (IV) Abducens (VI) Trigeminal (ophthalmic and maxillary division) (V) and Oculo-sympathetic nerves.  The superior orbital fissure syndrome is similar to the cavernous sinus syndrome except for the presence of proptosis. Lesions of the cerebellopontine angle causes compression of cranial nerves V (trigeminal), VII (facial) and VIII (vestibulocochlear).  Lesions of the midbrain cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the exact area affected."
urinary system,358,Which is correct regarding undescended testes?,Are always approached using an inguinal incision,Are bilateral in 50% of cases,Ectopic testes may be found in the perineum,Require orchidopexy when the child is approximately 4-years-old,Usually require a two-stage procedure,C,"Unilateral undescended testis is the commonest. The testis may be intra-abdominal (impalpable) or palpable at or near the external ring. Ectopic sites include the perineum and thigh. Orchidopexy is performed around the age of 2, and either an inguinal or scrotal approach used depending on the position of the testis."
urinary system,359,A 50-year-old man presented with 18 months history of parasthesia of his feet and hands. On examination there is numbness of glove and stocking distribution with generalised hyporeflexia. Nerve conduction studies revealed demyelinative sensory polyneuropathy. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?,Alcohol abuse,Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy,Diabetes,Vasculitis,Vitamin B12 deficiency,B,"Causes of demyelinating polyneuropathy include:  Guillain-Barré syndrome Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) Paraproteinaemia Hereditary motor sensory neuropathy Refsum's disease HIV infection, and Amiodarone.  Causes of axonal polyneuropathy are:  Alcohol abuse Diabetes Vasculitis, and Vitamin deficiencies.  The difference here is between demyelinating and axonal neuropathies. "
urinary system,360,A 24-year-old female presents with a 48-hour history of vomiting and epigastric pain. She has vomited over ten times in the last day. There is no history of diarrhoea and the presumed diagnosis is viral gastroenteritis. What is the most likely picture of her acid base status?,Mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis,Primary metabolic acidosis,Primary metabolic alkalosis,Primary respiratory acidosis,Primary respiratory alkalosis,C,"Copious vomiting in this patient leads to loss of gastric contents which are predominantly acidic. Loss of acid secretions from the stomach renders this patient deficient of acid in her blood; hence her acid base status will be reflective of metabolic alkalosis. One may also expect a lower serum potassium and chloride which are also lost in gastric secretions. Primary metabolic acidosis, mixed metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis are incorrect because the patient is in acid deficit rather than acid excess. There is no primary respiratory pathology in the question and so primary respiratory acidosis and primary respiratory alkalosis are incorrect."
urinary system,361,Which statement is true regarding gabapentin?,Is a potent hepatic enzyme inducer,Is of particular value as monotherapy in absence attacks (petit mal),Requires dose adjustment in renal disease,Side effects typically include visual field defects with long term use,Therapy is best monitored through measuring plasma concentrations,C,"Gabapentin does not induce cytochrome P450 unlike other anticonvulsants such as phenytoin and phenobarbitone. Vigabatrin may cause visual field defects, which may be irreversible. Rarely have visual disturbances been associated with gabapentin. Gabapentin is no use in petit mal and is used for add-on therapy in partial or generalised seizures."
urinary system,362,A 54-year-old man being seen in the neurology clinic for a tremor is noted to have a shuffling gait. Examination reveals difficulty with vertical gaze and an AMTS of 6/10. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Corticobasal degeneration,Idiopathic benign essential tremor,Parkinson's disease,Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),Wilson's disease,D,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is correct. The triad of parkinsonism, vertical gaze palsy and cognitive impairment suggest this diagnosis. Progressive supranuclear palsy is characterised by features of parkinsonism, difficulty with vertical gaze due to supranuclear paralysis of upward and downward gaze and cognitive impairment. It is also known as Steele-Richardson-Olszewski syndrome, is progressive like Parkinson's disease, but does not respond to L-dopa. Corticobasal degeneration is incorrect as it does not cause vertical gaze disturbance. Idiopathic benign essential tremor is incorrect as there is more than a tremor. Parkinson's disease is incorrect as there is more than parkinsonism. As vertical gaze is affected in this scenario, Wilson's disease is incorrect."
urinary system,363,"A 67-year-old woman presents with severe back pain and urinary retention with overflow. She says that her lower back has been aching for the past six weeks, but the pain has become significantly worse over the past 48 hours. There is a medical history of hypertension, but nothing else of note. Her BP is 142/82 mmHg, pulse is 73 and regular. She is unable to get off the couch due to distal lower limb weakness. Tone is increased bilaterally and her reflexes are increased. As you chat to her you notice fasciculation. There is perianal loss of sensation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Anterior spinal artery aneurysm,Anterior spinal artery thrombosis,Cauda equina syndrome,Conus medullaris syndrome,Sacroiliitis,D,"Conus medularis syndrome presents with mixed upper and lower motor neurone signs. These include bilateral distal weakness with increased tone and hyper-reflexia, fasciculation. Sensory loss is most marked in the perianal region. It is much rarer that cauda equina syndrome. Spinal cord infarction related to anterior spinal artery disease presents most frequently with sudden onset pain and loss of power and sensation beginning in the thoracic region. The symptoms seen here have slowly built up over a few weeks and affect a more distal spinal cord distribution. Sacroiliitis would not be associated with neurological deficit. Cauda equina syndrome is associated with flaccid paralysis.      Conus Medullaris Syndrome Cauda Equina Syndrome   Presentation Sudden and bilateral Gradual and may be unilateral leg signs initially   Reflexes Knee jerks preserved, ankle jerks affected Both knee and ankle jerks affected   Radicular pain Less severe More severe   Sensory Numbness often localised to perianal area, dissociation can occur, usually bilateral and symmetrical Numbness often localised to the saddle area, may be asymmetrical and unilateral, sensory loss often dermatomal   Motor Symmetrical, hyperreflexic disal paresis, less marked than cauda equina, may be fasciculations Areflexic paraplegic, may be asymmetric, more marked than conus medullaris, fasciculations rare, atrophy more common   Impotence Frequent Often less marked   Sphincter dysfunction Urinary retention and atonic anal sphincter present early in disease (can cause overflow urinary incontinence) Urinary retention, usually presents later in course of disease   Low back pain More marked Less marked    "
urinary system,364,In which condition would a raised serum bicarbonate level be expected?,Chronic renal failure,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Glucose 6 phosphate deficiency,Hyperkalaemia,Pyloric stenosis,E,Chronic renal failure is associated with a mild acidosis. In diabetic ketoacidosis the bicarbonate is low. Glucose 6 phosphate deficiency is associated with a lactic acidosis. A metabolic alkalosis usually accompanies hypokalaemia due to a shift of hydrogen ions from the extracellular to the intracellular space. The loss of acid from persistent vomiting causes volume depletion and hypochloraemia. 
urinary system,365,"A man has a BP of 160/90 mmHg, proteinuria ++. KUB US shows kidneys are equally reduced in size with smooth borders and normal pelvic calyceal system. What is the cause of hypertension in the patient?",Chronic glomerulonephritis,Chronic pyelonephritis,Bilateral renal artery stenosis,Essential HTN,Polycystic kidney,C,"Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of the renal arteries, most often caused by atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. This narrowing of the renal artery can impede blood flow to the kidneys, resulting in renovascular hypertension – a secondary type of high blood pressure"
urinary system,366,"A 39-year-old female presents with weakness, diplopia and fatigue. She had recently been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. On examination there is bilateral ptosis and weakness of abduction of both eyes and mild proximal weakness of the arms and legs but normal reflexes and sensation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Guillain-Barré syndrome,Mononeuritis multiplex,Multiple sclerosis,Myasthenia gravis,Polymyositis,D,"The most likely diagnosis is myasthenia gravis. There is an association between myasthenia gravis and thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The condition is more common in women with a peak incidence around the age of 30. It is characterised by weakness and fatigability of the proximal limb muscles, ocular and bulbar muscles. Seventy five per cent of patients initially complain of ocular disturbance, mainly ptosis and diploplia. Reflexes are initially preserved but may be fatigable. In Guillain-Barré syndrome there is a post-infective weakness and numbness in the distal limbs which ascends over days and weeks. Multiple sclerosis can produce a variety of neurological symptoms. Common ophthalmic presentations include optic neuritis and internuclear ophthalmoplegia. Mononeuritis multiplex describes an asymmetric asynchronous sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy, involving at least two separate nerve areas. It can be caused by a number of different disorders, including diabetes, vasculitis, Lyme disease and sarcoidosis. Polymyositis classically presents with relatively painless progressive proximal muscle weakness. Dysphagia is common but the ocular muscles are very rarely involved unlike myasthenia gravis where this is a predominant feature."
urinary system,367,Which of the following is the mechanism of action of the diuretic spironolactone?,Osmotic diuretic,Sodium/chloride co-transporter at distal convoluted tubule,Sodium/potassium co-transporter at the distal convoluted tubule,Sodium/potassium co-transporter at the proximal convoluted tubule,Sodium/potassium/chloride co-transporter in thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle,C,"Spironolactone is a steroid with a structure which resembles aldosterone, a naturally occuring adrenocorticoid hormone. It acts as a competitive inhibitor of aldosterone and acts at the distal convoluted tubule and inhibits the sodium/potassium co-transporter, thereby increasing sodium and water excretion and reducing potassium excretion. It is classed as a potassium sparing diuretic or aldosterone antagonist.  Mannitol and isosorbide are examples of osmotic diuretics. Inhibition of the sodium/chloride co-transporter is the mechanism of action of thiazide diuretics, and loop diuretics work at the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. "
urinary system,368,A 75-year-old lady attends the Emergency department with amaurosis fugax on the left. Carotid scanning shows stenosis of 80% on the right and 90% on the left. What is the best course of action?,Bilateral carotid endarterectomy,Discharge and GP follow up,Discharge and outpatient follow up,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the left,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the right,D,"Carotid artery atherosclerosis is an important cause of amaurosis fugax. The left-sided neurological signs in this patient indicate the symptomatic carotid is on the left side. Carotid endarterectomy has been established as an effective treatment for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients who are shown to have carotid artery stenosis. It reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death by 48% in a person with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis (greater than70%) who has had a TIA. The peri-operative risk of disabling stroke or death is approximately 3%. Current UK guidelines recommend endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis, based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial which showed clear benefit. The endarterectomy should be performed as soon as the patient is fit for surgery, preferably within two weeks of a TIA. The benefit is marginal for symptomatic patients with 50-69% stenosis, but may be greater in male patients. NICE recommends these patients are also considered for endarterectomy. There is significantly less benefit for asymptomatic patients, even those with greater than 60% stenosis. Patients with less than 50% stenosis should not be considered for carotid surgery Recurrent stenosis can occur in 1-20% of patients following endarterectomy, and re-operation is needed in 1-3% of cases. Ipsilateral strokes occur in 9% of patients following endarterectomy, and 26% of those treated with medical management alone (within 2 years). All patients with suspected non-disabling stroke or TIA who are considered as candidates for carotid endarterectomy should have carotid imaging within 1 week. Carotid endarterectomy is also indicated following a non-disabling stroke. However, if the patient has had a disabling stroke there is no real benefit in them undergoing the procedure. Carotid stenting is increasingly being used as an alternative to endarterectomy. This is a less invasive revascularisation strategy, and uses an embolic protection device. There seems to be a similar early risk of death or stroke, and similar long-term benefits. Risk is higher in elderly patients, possibly due to vascular tortuosity and calcification. The procedure is currently indicated in selected cases, such as restenosis. * please note for this explanation we have used the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterecomy Trial (NASCET) criteria, as opposed to the European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group (ECST) criteria.

urinary system,369,"A 16-year-old female presents with ankle swelling four days after having had a sore throat. On examination, she had a blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg and ankle oedema. Investigations reveal:    Creatinine 90 µmol/L (60-110)   Albumin 25 g/L (37-49)   24 hour urinary protein 9 g (less than0.2)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Idiopathic membranous nephropathy,IgA nephropathy,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,Minimal change nephropathy,Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,B,"Idiopathic membranous nephropathy accounts for 2-5% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in children, and 20-30% of cases in adults. The immune mechanism that leads to the development of membranous nephropathy is unknown. Histologically, it is characterised by diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on light microscopy. On immunofluorescence, the thickening is caused by immune deposits of IgG and C3, on the subepithelial surface of the GBM. When not idiopathic, it is associated with:  AI diseases - SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease drugs - gold, penicillamine, captopril malignancy - bronchus, breast, stomach, colon, prostate infections - hep B, syphilis, leprosy, filariasis, and diabetes mellitus.  Membranoproliferative (or mesangiocapillary) glomerulonephritis can be classed into three types (I, II, and III) depending on which complement pathway is activated. It is associated with SLE, cryoglobulinaemia with or without hep C, chronic infections (SBE) or with neoplasms. It is not associated acutely with upper respiratory tract infections. Minimal change nephropathy is the most common form of nephrotic syndrome in children (peak incidence 2-3 years of age). The histological findings on light microscopy are normal or small looking glomeruli. On electron microscopy there is effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes over the outer surface of the GBM. It tends to be steroid responsive in children, but over 60% of children will have further relapses. In adults, it is associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other carcinomas. Post-streptococcal GN, as the name implies, occurs 10-14 days after an acute infection. The typical case occurs following infection with group A Lancefield streptococci (β-haemolytic strep, S. pyogenes) either causing pharyngitis or skin infections. It is more common in the developing world. The histology shows diffuse proliferative GN, with infiltration by neutrophil polymorphs. The main treatment is eradication of the infection (10/7 course of penicillin) and symptomatic relief of the acute nephritis. The need for dialysis is uncommon, and complete recovery of renal function should occur. The correct answer is IgA nephritis, in this case presenting with nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephritis is most common during the second and third decade of life. It commonly occurs within two days of an onset of an upper respiratory tract infection, or less commonly, infection of other mucous membranes (e.g. GI, bladder, breast). It should be diagnosed by a renal biopsy, where IgA is seen deposited in the mesangium. The treatment of IgA nephritis is variable. In a patient with haematuria only, the treatment is conservative. When there is nephrotic range proteinuria (greater than3 g/day - as in this case) an 8-12 week course of prednisolone should be prescribed. If the proteinuria is less than3 g/day an ACE inhibitor can be used. In all patients, careful control of blood pressure should be achieved, by using ACE inhibitors in the first instance, and regular follow-up of renal function and urinalysis. 30% of children will have a spontaneous remission within 10 years, but 25% will go on to develop ESRF within 20 years."

urinary system,376,"A 22-year-old female presents with a month history of episodic, brief visual loss affecting the right eye. Over the last one year she had gained a considerable amount of weight. Examination reveals a BMI of 35, with bilateral optic disc swelling, worse on the right and small retinal haemorrhages on the right. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Craniopharyngioma ,Graves' ophthalmopathy,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH),Optic neuritis ,Sagittal sinus thrombosis,C,"The combination of papilloedema and visual disturbance in a young overweight woman should lead you to a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is thought to be due to impaired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) absorption across the arachnoid villi into the dural sinuses. Its exact cause is unknown, but it is most common in overweight young women. If left untreated it can result in permanent visual loss. IIH normally presents with headache, blurred vision, dizziness, horizontal diplopia and transient visual loss (as described here). Ophthalmological examination demonstrates papilloedema, an enlarged blind spot, and reduced peripheral vision. Opening pressure is raised on lumbar puncture. Treatment is with a combination of weight loss, acetazolamide, and regular lumbar puncture. Drugs thought to increase the risk (oral contraceptives, steroids, tetracycline, nitrofurantoin) should be withdrawn or avoided. If sight is threatened optic nerve fenestration should be considered. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting can be performed in resistant cases. Both craniopharyngioma and sagittal sinus thrombosis would be expected to produce focal neurological signs in addition to papilloedema. Intermittent visual loss would not be classical. Optic neuritis tends to present with reduced visual acuity, pain, relative afferent pupillary defect and red colour desaturation. It causes papillitis only if it affects the nerve head, rather than the retrobulbar portion of the nerve. Graves's ophthalmology results in restrictions of eye movements, lid lag, exopthalmos and chemosis. The presentation described above is not classical."
urinary system,377,"A 64-year old man is admitted to the Emergency Department. A recent discharge letter lists his comorbidities as diet controlled diabetes mellitus, chronic renal failure, angina, hypercholesterolaemia and hypertension. He drinks between four to six units per day and is an ex-smoker with a 20 pack year history. You note blood tests from one month ago indicating a urea of 21 mmol/L and creatinine of 600 μmol/L. He describes a sudden onset retrosternal pain that started 12 hours previously and is sharp and pleuritic. On examination, he is distressed but haemodynamically stable with a blood pressure of 133/57 mmHg, a heart rate of 78 and oxygen saturations of 99% on air. He is hunched forward as he feels this makes the pain better. He does not have a fistula in situ. His heart sounds are dual with no murmurs and there are fine bibasal crepitations on respiratory examination. You can not discern a raised JVP but there is mild bilateral pitting oedema to mid calf. An ECG reveals ST elevation in all leads. A chest radiograph indicates mild pulmonary oedema with no cardiomegaly. A full blood count is normal and electrolytes reveal:    Sodium 140 mmol/L   Potassium 5.2 mmol/L   Urea 44 mmol/L   Creatinine 746 μmol/L    What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",CT angiogram,Haemodialysis,Omeprazole and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy,Primary coronary angioplasty,Treatment dose low molecular weight heparin and CT pulmonary angiogram,B,"The most likely diagnosis in the patient is uraemic pericarditis. We do not have enough history to discern how his kidney disease is usually managed, but in the presence of pericarditis haemodialysis is required. Other hard indications for acute haemodialysis are hyperkalaemia, acidosis and pulmonary oedema not responding to medical treatment. Softer indications include other uraemic symptoms and anuria without any hard indications.  Aortic dissection is typically a sharp pain radiating to the back. The long history and ECG changes make this diagnosis unlikely. Haemodialysis is appropriate in this patient with uraemic pericarditis. Omeprazole and oesophagogastroduodenoscopy would be inappropriate as there is no suggestion of upper gastrointestinal pathology. Primary coronary angioplasty would not be suitable for this patient as the ECG changes of global ST segment elevation relate better to pericarditis than acute coronary syndrome. The history and ECG changes fit better with pericarditis than a pulmonary embolism; therefore treatment with dose low molecular weight heparin and CTPA would be inappropriate."
urinary system,378,"A 16-year-old female presents with a three-year history of recurrent colicky loin pain. One year ago she passed a renal calculus. Twenty-four-hour urine collection showed normal levels of calcium, phosphate and urate, but elevated levels of arginine, cystine, lysine and ornithine. Which one of the following features is characteristic of this condition?",Accumulation of cystine in collecting system,Autosomal dominant inheritance,Cystine deposits within the Cornea,Functional defects within the glomeruli,Radiolucent renal stone formation on CT scan,A,"This condition is typical of cystinuria (nephropathic cystinosis), an autosomal recessive genetic defect in membrane transport for cystine, lysine, ornithine and arginine in epithelial cells. The glomerulus is unable to resorb these amino acids, and they are therefore excreted into the urine. The rBAT gene is responsible, and there are three forms distinguished by the pattern of tubular amino acid transport. Cystinuria usually presents with recurrent nephrolithiasis in the form of cystine stones (which are often bilateral, multiple, and can form staghorns). These can present as early as the first decade. Renal failure can occur. The stones are radiolucent stones, which may also be seen with uric acid stones. However, they are usually opaque on a CTKUB. Cystine deposits within the cornea are not classically seen, neither are functional defects within the glomeruli. Diagnosis of cystinuria can be made by stone analysis; such stones are pale yellow and analysis reveals high cystine levels. It can then be confirmed by an amino acid chromatogram and quantification of cystine excretion. First-line management is conservative, with encouragement of large volume fluid intake (particularly in the evening, with the aim to pass urine at least once overnight). Urine pH should be regularly monitored (aiming for 7.5-8), with sodium bicarbonate being used if necessary (not in hypertensive patients or those with renal failure). The aim of such treatment is to reduce the urinary cystine concentration to below 300 mg/L. If this fails, d-penicillamine, alpha-mercaptopropionylglycine or captopril can be used. Cystine stones are not easily broken by lithotripsy, and therefore percutaneous removal is most often used if they do develop."
urinary system,379,Which of the following is true regarding priapism?,A peak systolic velocity of 1 m/s in the cavernosal arteries is normal,Has an association with diabetes mellitus in most cases,Poorly oxygenated blood within the corpora cavernosa is indicative of low flow (veno-occlusive) priapism,Results more commonly from high flow form rather than the veno-occlusive form,The treatment of choice for arterial priapism is intracavernous administration of alpha-adrenergic agonists,C,"The peak systolic velocity in the cavernosal arteries is normally less than 0.4 m/s. A higher flow in the presence of priapism is indicative of high-flow (arterial) priapism. Priapism is primary or idiopathic in 60% of cases. Twenty per cent of secondary priapism cases are haematologic in origin, for example:  Sickle cell disease Leukaemia, and Heparin therapy.  Other causes are:  Neurogenic Traumatic, and Infectious.  On the basis of aetiology, priapism can be broadly divided into low flow (veno-occlusive) and high flow (arterial) varieties. The former involves a physiologic or mechanical obstruction to venous drainage of the penis which causes a build-up of viscous, poorly oxygenated blood within the corpora cavernosa. The origin of priapism in these cases may be secondary to multiple areas of sludging and thrombosis. The major causes of veno-occlusive priapism are:  Complication of sickle cell disease Haematopoietic malignancy, and A hypercoagulable state.  Arterial (high-flow) priapism is a physiologically distinct entity which is markedly less common than the veno-occlusive form. Arterial priapism results from unregulated inflow of arterial blood into the lacunar spaces of the corpora cavernosa from a lacerated cavernous artery, bypassing regulatory function of helicine arterioles. Aetiology of increased arterial inflow may be:  Secondary to arteriovenous fistula Frank arterial laceration with extravasation, and A pseudoaneurysm.  Although most cases of high flow priapism are secondary to blunt or penetrating trauma to the perineum or penis, a large majority of cases - especially in adults - may be idiopathic, without history of pertinent trauma or findings of anatomic abnormalities. Arterial priapism may be treated with arterial ligation or percutaneous embolisation. Other therapeutic modalities, such as sustained perineal compression and ice packs, or intracavernous administration of alpha-adrenergic agonists have proven to be less effective."

How should this patient be managed?,Add benzhexol,L-dopa,Propranolol,Reduce dose cyclosporin,Reduce dose salbutamol,D,"Cyclosporin is well known to cause coarse tremor. In the first instance the dose should be reduced. Usually the neurological side effects of cyclosporin are dose-dependent. The tremor with salbutamol tends not to be coarse as described in this case, being approximately 10-12 Hz. Propranolol can be used as a treatment for some forms of tremor. L-dopa is used as a treatment for Parkinson's disease, which is associated with a pill rolling tremor. Benzhexol is also used for Parkinson's."

Although meningovascular syphilis can present in many different forms it is rather rare. Syringomyelia is associated with headaches, motor and bladder symptoms and is the less likely diagnosis. There is syrinx (fluid-filled cavitation) in the central spinal cord, usually cervical. This can elongate and enlarge, causing compression of the corticospinal and spinothalamic tracts and anterior horn cells. Syringobulbia describes the situation when the syrinx extends into the brainstem. The most common cause is impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation, usually due to a Chiari malformation (also associated with arachnoiditis, meningeal carcinomatosis, space-occupying lesions or idiopathic). It is more common in men than women, and usually presents in the 20s and 30s although it can present later in life. Sensory features are pain and temperature loss, classically in a shawl-like distribution and dysaesthesia. Light touch, vibration and position sense are affected later. Motor signs start as muscle wasting and weakness that begins in the hands, and progresses to affect the forearms and shoulders. Tendon reflexes are lost and there may be respiratory muscle involvement. Bladder, bowel and sexual dysfunction can develop, as can Horner's syndrome. Extension of the syrinx into the lumbar region can involve the legs. Lumbar puncture should be avoided due to the risk of herniation. CT and MRI can be used to delineate the extent. Management involves physiotherapy, and neurosurgery to halt progression. Prognosis is variable, but early surgical involvement is beneficial. In this scenario, the alcohol is a distractor."

Angiotensin receptor blockers are used for those patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors. Statins (hepatic 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) help treat hypercholesterolemia. Routine anticoagulation is controversial, and there is little consensus with regard to its use. The risk appears to be related to serum albumin level. If not used, the patient should be closely monitored for signs of venous thrombosis and anticoagulation continued long-term if it does occur. Patients who are asymptomatic and non-nephrotic do not require treatment with immunosuppressives. Those who are nephrotic and asymptomatic may also undergo spontaneous remission, and can be observed particularly if they have normal renal function. Immunosuppression is indicated in those patients who have:  Increased creatinine level at presentation Progressive disease Symptomatic nephrotic syndrome (which is the case in this scenario) Persistent nephrotic syndrome (especially in men or those older than 50y) Thromboembolism Tubulointerstitial changes or focal sclerosis  It can also be considered in those with increased IgG excretion, HLA-DR3/B8, white race, elevation of urinary excretion of complement activation products. Where immunosuppression is indicated, corticosteroids alone are ineffective. The Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines recommend alternating months of corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide, initially over 6 months, with the aim of preserving renal function and achieving total remission. Mycophenolate mofetil can be used where there is a concern regarding the toxicity of alkylating agents. Cyclosporin and calcineurin inhibitors can also be successful in those who don't tolerate the steroid/cyclophosphamide regimen. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against the CD20 antigen of B lymphocytes, and can be used where the standard immunosuppression options detailed above fail. Corticotropin has also been used in this setting. "
urinary system,388,"A 28-year-old gentleman presents with haematuria, progressive renal impairment and hearing problems. Of note, there is a strong family history of renal problems with family members requiring dialysis. Further workup of this gentleman leads to a diagnosis of Alport's syndrome. What is the characteristic otological problem associated with this condition?",Conductive deafness,Mastoiditis,Perforated ear drum,Recurrent otitis media,Sensorineural deafness,E,"Alport's syndrome is associated with a gene mutation resulting in a disruption in the formation of type IV collagen. This is due to impaired adhesion of the organ of Corti which contains the auditory sensory cells. This is related to the structural integrity of the basement membrane, important for the kidney, middle ear and eye function. Sensorineural deafness results as a consequence. It is not associated with conductive deafness. There is no increased association with ear infections such as otitis media, mastoiditis and perforated ear drum. Hence these answers should not be selected."
urinary system,389,"A 65-year-old male presented to the ER with sudden onset difficulty in speaking. There was no weakness of arms or legs. He was conscious and could follow commands. The man complained of difficulty also in swallowing and chewing. There was no diplopia or vertigo. On examination, the tongue was deviated to the right but there was no fasciculation. Deep tendon jerks were normal and plantar response was bilateral flexor. Although he could not open his mouth on command, his son noticed that he was opening his mouth for yawning. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?",Bulbar palsy,Frontal lobe syndrome,Gerstmann syndrome,Opercular syndrome,Psychogenic mutism,D,"This man has presented with symptoms and signs limited to bulbar and masticatory muscles, especially for voluntary actions. Involuntary movement of these muscles, like yawning, was preserved. Also, there are no long tract signs like extensor plantar or increased DTR. This is known as opercular syndrome.  This is not bulbar palsy as involuntary movements are preserved, like yawning. In bulbar palsy, all movements will be lost. Also, chewing movements (Vth nerve) and facial movements (VIIth nerve) will not be affected in bulbar palsy. The frontal lobe syndrome comprises a group of disorders. The clinical features vary widely, but some common features include abulia, personality changes, memory disorders and apathy.  In Gerstmann syndrome, there is mainly higher cortical dysfunction like finger anomia, right-left confusion and acalculia. It does not have such prominent bulbar motor signs.  Psychogenic syndromes can sometimes mimic organic disorders. But usually, psychogenic syndromes defy any known neurological pattern. Also, organic syndromes must be ruled out first before labelling a case as psychogenic."
urinary system,390,"A 31-year-old man presented with a history of fever, night sweats, shortness of breath, and weight loss for two months. His chest radiograph showed a moderately severe, left pleural effusion only. He consented to an HIV test which was positive. Which is the most likely cause of pleural effusion?",Hodgkin's lymphoma,Pleural tuberculosis,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP),Pulmonary aspergillosis,Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma,B,"Pleural tuberculosis is the most likely cause in an HIV-positive African man with a two-month history of weight loss. His pleural effusion is due to pleural tuberculosis (extrapulmonary tuberculosis). Hodgkin's lymphoma can cause pleural effusion due to pleural involvement but it is often associated with mediastinal mass. His chest radiograph showed only pleural effusion. HIV related lymphoma is usually a high grade diffuse large B cell lymphoma rather than Hodgkin's lymphoma in these patients. PCP does not cause pleural effusion. It typically causes bilateral reticular shadows from the hila without any hilar lymph node enlargement or pleural effusion. Pulmonary aspergillosis shows infiltrative lesions but it does not typically cause pleural effusion. Pulmonary Kaposi's sarcoma can cause pleural effusion by involving the pleura, but it often causes coarse irregular nodular lesions in the lungs. "
urinary system,391,"Regarding sildenafil (Viagra), which of the following statements is correct?",Increases libido,Is associated with nasal congestion as a recognised side effect,Is associated with red visual discolouration as a recognised side effect,Is contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease,Is of no use in patients who have developed impotence following prostate surgery,B,"Sildenafil is a well-established treatment for impotence and works through the inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5, producing cavernous venodilation and erections in appropriately stimulated patients. It does not increase sex drive/libido. It is contraindicated in subjects taking nitrates as it may produce hypotension, but it is not contraindicated in patients with ischaemic heart disease per se. Side effects include flushing which develops in the majority, but it is also associated with nasal congestion and blue visual discolouration. "
urinary system,392,"A 47-year-old man is admitted to the Emergency department after collapsing following a cricket match in his village. He was apparently hit on the head with the ball whilst batting, but got up afterwards. During the following 30 minutes he became increasingly confused, drowsy and then unresponsive, slumped in a chair. On examination his BP is elevated at 180/110 mmHg, with a pulse of 58. His GCS is 6. He is intubated and ventilated. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",IV acetazolamide,IV alteplase,IV furosemide,IV heparin,IV mannitol,E,"The history is classical for an extradural haemorrhage, and the clinical picture is consistent with raised intracranial pressure. As such the initial treatment of choice is IV mannitol; it leads to reduced intracranial pressure and improves cerebral blood flow. Hyperventilation is also considered to further reduce intracranial pressure whilst awaiting neurosurgical intervention. IV acetazolamide can be used though is not as quick acting as mannitol. Alteplase is used in blocked lines or in thrombolysis.  Furosemide is a diuretic.  Heparin is used in the treatment of DVT/PE or as prophylaxis."
urinary system,393,Which of the following concerning renal blood flow is true?,Can be measured using the Fick principle,Is 40% of the cardiac output at rest,Is decreased in response to hypoxia,Is higher in the medulla than the cortex,Is increased when renal nerves are stimulated,A,Renal blood flow (RBF) is approximately 25% of cardiac output. The 'Fick principle' can be used to estimate RBF through clearance. RBF is higher in the cortex than medulla as one might expect with the increasing glomeruli in this region. Sympathetic stimuli produce vasoconstriction and RBF should be increased in response to hypoxia.
urinary system,394,A 61 year old patient is seen in clinic due to overactive bladder. She has been doing bladder training under the guidance of the incontinence nurses for 12 months but hasn't seen a significant improvement. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?,Transdermal Oxybutynin,Oral Tolterodine,Oral Mirabegron,Oral Desmopressin,Oral Imipramine,B,As can be seen from the summary below an oral antimuscarinic such as Tolterodine is an appropriate next step.Desmopressin could be offered to treat nocturia but you are not given that information in the question. Urinary Incontinence It is useful to classify patients into stress incontinence (SI) or overactive bladder (OAB). For SI lifestyle measures including weight loss if BMI over 30 and fluid management are key. If these fail a plethora of invasive procedures may be considered by MDT.

urinary system,395,In which of the following situations would a percutaneous needle biopsy of the kidney be most helpful and appropriate?,Fever with suspected acute pyelonephritis,Premature neonate with suspected polycystic kidney disease,Prostatic hyperplasia with suspected hydronephrosis,Suspected renal cyst,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and acute renal failure,E,"The renal manifestations of SLE are highly variable, ranging from mild asymptomatic proteinuria and/or haematuria to rapidly progressive uraemia. The various presentations are difficult to classify into clinical syndromes and histological classes. Although lupus nephritis affects a third of patients early in the disease it is frequently unrecognised until nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome with renal failure occur. Histologically, a number of different types of renal disease are recognised in SLE, with immune-complex mediated glomerular disease being the most common. The up to date International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification divides these into six different patterns:  I - minimal mesangial II - mesangial proliferative III - focal IV - diffuse V - membranous VI - advanced sclerosis  Glomeruli appear normal by light microscopy in minimal mesangial lupus nephritis, but immunofluorescence demonstrates mesangial immune deposits. Mesangial proliferative nephritis presents clinically as microscopic haematuria and/or proteinuria. Hypertension is uncommon and nephrotic syndrome and renal impairment are very rarely seen. Biopsy demonstrates segmental areas of increased mesangial matrix and cellularity, with mesangial immune deposits. A few isolated subepithelial or subendothelial deposits may be visible by immunofluorescence. The prognosis is good and specific treatment is only indicated if the disease progresses. Focal disease is more advanced, but still affects less than 50% of glomeruli. Haematuria and proteinuria is almost always seen, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and elevated creatinine may be present. Biopsy demonstrates active or inactive focal, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary glomerulonephritis involving less than 50% of glomeruli, typically with focal subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations. It is further subdivided:  A: Active lesions: focal proliferative lupus nephritis A/C: Active and chronic lesions: focal proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis C: Chronic inactive lesions with glomerular scars: focal sclerosing lupus nephritis  Prognosis is variable. Diffuse glomerulonephritis is the most common and severe form of lupus nephritis. Haematuria and proteinuria are almost always present, and nephrotic syndrome, hypertension and renal impairment common. Biopsies demonstrate active or inactive diffuse, segmental or global endo- or extracapillary glomerulonephritis involving more than 50% of all glomeruli, typically with diffuse subendothelial immune deposits, with or without mesangial alterations. This class is divided into diffuse segmental (IV-S) when more than 50% of the involved glomeruli have segmental lesions, and diffuse global (IV-G) when more than 50% of involved glomeruli have global lesions. Segmental is defined as a glomerular lesions that involves less than half of the glomerular tuft.  IV-S (A): Active lesions, diffuse segmental proliferative lupus nephritis IV-G (A): Active lesions, diffuse global proliferative IV-S (A/C): Active and chronic lesions, diffuse segmental proliferative and sclerosing lupus nephritis IV-S (C): Chronic inactive lesions with scars, diffuse segmental sclerosing lupus nephritis IV-G (C): Chronic inactive lesions with scars: diffuse global sclerosing lupus nephritis  Immunosuppressive therapy is required in these cases to prevent progressive to end-stage renal failure. Patients with membranous lupus nephritis tend to present with nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic haematuria and hypertension may also be seen. Biopsies show global or segmental subepithelial immune deposits or their morphologic sequelae, with or without mesangial alterations. It may occur in combination with class III or IV, in which case both are diagnosed. Progression is variable, and immunosuppression is not always needed. In advanced sclerosis, more than 90% of glomeruli are globally sclerosed without residual activity. Features associated with a poorer prognosis, and increased risk of progression to end stage renal failure include:  young age (less than23) increased serum creatinine diffuse proliferative lesions (WHO classification class IV), and a high chronicity index on renal histologic analysis.  With regard to the management of lupus nephritis a biopsy is indicated in those patients with abnormal urinalysis and/or reduced renal function. This can provide a histological classification as well as information regarding activity, chronicity and prognosis. Cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine reduce mortality in proliferative forms of lupus glomerulonephritis. The diagnosis of pyelonephritis is made on the basis of clinical presentation and positive urine culture, with or without ultrasound findings. Renal biopsy is rarely required. Polycystic kidney disease is usually diagnosed with characteristic appearances on ultrasound. Hydronephrosis associated with prostatic disease can be diagnosed on ultrasound, and biopsy is not indicated. Renal cysts are usually found on ultrasound and CT. Tissue may be needed to differentiate between malignant and benign cysts, but this is obtained via aspiration rather than renal parenchymal biopsy. "
urinary system,396,A 70-year-old female who has a history of chronic anxiety presents with a three day history of severe left temporal headache radiating from the eye to the scalp. She had also experienced discomfort during eating. Which one of the following drugs should be given to this patient while awaiting the results of diagnostic tests?,Aciclovir ,Carbamazepine,Diclofenac,Prednisolone,Sumatriptan ,D,"The features described here are classical for giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA affects large and medium sized arteries, with a predilection for the external carotid, ciliary and retinal arteries. Endovascular damage and cytokine-mediated inflammation causes local ischaemia. There is considerable overlap with polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms of both should be sought. Twenty per cent of patients develop loss of vision, which can be prevented with timely recognition and treatment. The classically described jaw claudication occurs is a minority of cases, but does indicate a high risk of ischaemic complications. The typical presentation of GCA is a temporal headache, with myalgia, malaise and fever. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) are usually raised. Once the diagnosis is suspected, high dose corticosteroids should be given. If visual symptoms are present, intravenous methylprednisolone should be given. Once symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolve, the dose of corticosteroid can be reduced and usually stopped within two years. A differential diagnosis is trigeminal neuralgia, although this tends to present with paroxysms of pain which last for thirty seconds to two minutes. Carbamazepine is the first-line treatment. However, due to the threat to a patient's sight it is most appropriate to treat first for GCA in the above scenario. Aciclovir could be used to treat ophthalmic shingles, however in this scenario you would expect characteristic lesions in addition to pain. Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug which is indicated in the management of simple headache. Sumitriptan is a 5-HT1 agonist which is used for the treatment of migraines and cluster headaches. It would be unusual for these to present for the first time in a 70-year-old patient, and it would be unusual for the attacks to last as long as described above. "
urinary system,397,Which of the following statements regarding CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is correct?,Computerised tomography (CT) of the brain is diagnostic,Death usually occurs in infancy,It is associated with an abnormality of the X chromosome,It may present with migraine,The thalami are usually spared,D,"CADASIL is a diffuse disease of small arteries, predominantly in the brain. It starts during mid adulthood and is characterised by:  recurrent ischaemic events (transient or permanent) attacks of migraine with aura severe mood disorders sub-cortical dementia, and a wide spread leukoencephalopathy on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  CT brain is not diagnostic. Characteristic MRI changes include T2 weighted hyperintensity of the periventricular white matter. A family history is almost always present, as it is an autosomal dominant condition, located to chromosome 19. Infarcts are subcortical, and the thalami and basal ganglia are usually involved."
urinary system,398,A 36 year old woman attends GOPD with episodes of very frequent incontinence during exercise. This is having a significant impact on her quality of life as she is now avoiding exercise. She reports a day time frequency of 10 and occasional episodes of urgency but no urgency incontinence. She has completed her family and has no significant past medical history. Which investigation or treatment would you first discuss with the woman?,Transvaginal tape procedure,Saline cystometry,Pelvic floor muscle training,Pad testing,Cystoscopy,C,"Stress incontinence is the predominant symptom in this patient, who has mixed urinary incontinence. NICE guidelines recommend that conservative management including a trial of supervised pelvic floor muscle training for at least 3 months is undertaken before offering surgery. This should comprise at least eight contractions performed three times per day. The guideline also recommends that cystometry is not performed before starting conservative treatments. Pad testing is not recommended by NICE."

Of note, he reports a sore throat two weeks prior. His anti-streptolysin O titre is positive and his renal function is mildly impaired. If this patient were to have a renal biopsy, which of the following is the most likely finding?",C4d staining positive,Effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy,Humps in the subepitheilal space on electron microscopy,IgA deposition in the mesangium,Tram track pattern on light microscopy,C,Not all cases of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (GN) require a biopsy. The characteristic electron microscopy findings are described in the correct option. C4d staining positive is incorrect as this refers to the detection of BK virus by the C4d stain. Podocyte effacement is incorrect as this is diagnostic of minimal change disease. IgA deposition in the mesangium is a biopsy finding in IgA nephropathy and so is incorrect. The tram track appearance on light microscopy represents membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and therefore should not be selected.

He had been previously on spironolactone and furosemide for prophylaxis of ascites however these were stopped some months ago. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and his renal failure does not respond to fluids. A urinalysis shows a trace amount of protein but nil else. An ultrasound of the renal tract shows no evidence of obstruction. Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment should initiated?",Terlipressin and albumin,Terlipressin,Broad spectrum antibiotics,Increased rate of IV fluids,Albumin,A,This patient has renal failure in the absence of hypovolaemia or nephrotoxics and in the presence of decompensated liver disease and ascites which makes hepatorenal syndrome the most likely diagnosis. There is no evidence of obstruction on the ultrasound and if glomerulonephritis were the cause then haematuria and significant proteinuria would be found. HRS is thought to be due to the combination of renal vasoconstriction secondary to activations of RAA and sympathetic nervous systems and alteration in renal prostaglandins. Other causes must be excluded before this is presumed to be the diagnosis. Terlipressin and albumin therapy should be utilised along with ensuring adequate hydration and avoiding nephrotoxics. TIPS and liver transplantation are other therapies utilised. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be utilised if sepsis is suspected.

This results in increased availability of free drug at any given dose, which then increases the risk of toxicity. Because laboratory assays for phenytoin usually measure total drug concentration, this gives a degree of false reassurance. In patients with renal failure, dose reduction of phenytoin is therefore required. Other drugs where this may be a problem include sodium valproate and warfarin."
urinary system,404,Which of the following is a feature of cystinuria?,A useful response to acidification of urine,Accumulation of cystine in the kidney,Autosomal dominant inheritance,Excessive urinary arginine excretion,Radiolucent urinary calculi on X ray,D,"Cystinuria is the commonest inborn error of amino acid transport. Amino acids excreted in urine are cystine, ornithine, arginine and lysine (mnemonic - COAL). The renal stones are radio-opaque due to the presence of sulphur. On plain film, which is not used as much in the UK anymore, they are radiolucent. On CT, as with almost all stones, cysteine stones are radio-opaque. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. Management includes alkalinisation along with high fluid intake (greater than4 L/day); d-penicillamine may also be used. It is cystinosis that leads to accumulation of cystine in the kidney. "

Her creatinine has also been found to be 347µmol/l (60-110). Which of the following would most support a diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)?",Extravascular eosinophils on vascular biopsy,Fixed pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs,Peak flow less than300 L/min,Peripheral alveolar filling infiltrate predominantly in the upper lobes on a chest radiograph,Peripheral 'stocking' neuropathy,A,"A diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) requires four of the following features:  asthma eosinophilia greater than 10% mononeuropathy or polyneuropathy paranasal sinus abnormality non-fixed pulmonary infiltrates visible on chest radiographs, and biopsy demonstrating extravascular eosinophils.  Peripheral alveolar filling infiltrates predominantly in the upper lobes on a chest radiograph is typical of chronic eosinophilic pneumonia. A peripheral 'stocking and glove' neuropathy is not typical of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)and is more common in type 2 diabetes.  Peak flow less than300 L/min is low, but is non-specific, and in isolation would not be suggestive of a diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)."

urinary system,410,A 46-year-old man is found to have nystagmus. On closer examination it is downbeat nystagmus. Which of the following conditions is the most likely to cause this clinical finding?,Aqueduct stenosis,Central cerebellar lesion,Chiari type I malformation,Unilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion,Wernicke's encephalopathy,C,"Nystagmus is defined as involuntary oscillations of the eyes. This may be pendular when the oscillations are equal in rate and amplitude, or jerking when there are quick and slow phases. (The quicker phase is used to define the direction.) Nystagmus may be caused by:  Visual disturbances Lesions of the labyrinth The central vestibular connections, and Brain stem or cerebellar lesions.  Pendular nystagmus is usually due to loss of macular vision, but may be seen in diffuse brain stem lesions. Jerking nystagmus which is of constant direction regardless of the direction of gaze, suggests a labyrinthine or cerebellar lesion. Nystagmus which changes with the direction of gaze suggests widespread central involvement of vestibular nuclei. Jerking nystagmus present only on lateral gaze, and the fast component of which is in the direction of gaze, indicates a lesion of the brain stem or cerebellum. Nystagmus confined to one eye suggests a peripheral lesion of the nerve or muscle, or a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle. Nystagmus restricted to the abducting eye on lateral gaze (ataxic nystagmus) is due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle between the pons and mid-brain as in multiple sclerosis (MS). Nystagmus occurring on upward gaze with the fast component upwards (upbeat nystagmus) may be due to a lesion in the mid-brain at the level of the superior colliculus. Downbeat nystagmus (fast phase downwards) suggests a lesion in the lower part of the medulla. It is therefore typical of the Arnold-Chiari malformation.  Wernicke's or thiamine deficiency is a rare cause of downbeat nystagmus and therefore is not as likely a diagnosis as the Arnold Chiari malformation in the option list."

There is nil of note on examination. There is no evidence of suprapubic tenderness or sepsis and he is not complaining of abdominal pain. There is no leucocytes or nitrates on urinalysis. A renal ultrasound shows no serial change.,Cystoscopy,Intravenous Urography,Renal Biopsy,CT KUB,Urine culture,A,Painless haematuria should always raise the suspicion of bladder cancer and should be excluded. In patients with renal disease obviously a flare of the underlying condition or progression must be investigated however there is no evidence of this in this case. Cystoscopy should therefore be organised to exclude bladder cancer.
urinary system,413,A 52-year-old woman with a history of bipolar disorder presents following an overdose of her mood stabilising medication; she cannot remember the name of the tablets. On examination she is drowsy and hyperreflexic and bloods show a worsening hypokalaemic metabolic acidosis. The renal team has been informed and are arranging for urgent dialysis. Which is the most appropriate immediate management while waiting for dialysis?,IV albumin,IV dextrose,IV furosemide,IV sodium bicarbonate,Oral sodium bicarbonate,D,"IV sodium bicarbonate is the most suitable option here to correct the worsening acidosis, although admittedly, dialysis is the optimum treatment in what sounds like severe lithium toxicity.  IV furosemide will not improve symptoms of lithium toxicity and there is no mention of hypoglycaemia in this patient ruling out the need for IV dextrose. IV albumin use is predominantly for rapid volume expansion and the patient above does not have any need for this as such. Oral sodium bicarbonate would not be of use in a patient with rapidly worsening acidosis as the time taken for absorption and availability in the blood would be too long."
urinary system,414,"A 55-year-old homeless male was found stuporous and smelling of alcohol. Observations in the Emergency Department reveal a core temperature of 34°C, a pulse of 50 bpm and blood pressure of 116/80 mmHg. Investigations reveal:    Creatinine 320 µmol/L (60-110)   Gamma GT 40 U/L (10-40)   AST 550 U/L (1-40)   LDH 1500 U/L (10-250)   Dipstick urine blood +++    Urine microscopy no cells or organisms. What is the most likely cause of the raised serum creatinine concentration?",Chronic renal failure,Dehydration,Hypothermia,Paracetamol poisoning,Rhabdomyolysis,E,"The elevated serum creatinine is most likely due to rhabdomyolysis as the patient was found unconscious, is hypothermic, and is likely to have sustained muscle injury. The latter is confirmed by an elevated aspartate aminotransferase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) but the normal gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) argues against these being released from the liver. Rhabdomyolysis is strongly suggested by the fact that urinalysis is strongly positive for blood, whereas urine microscopy is negative for red blood cells. The positive urinalysis is caused by myoglobin, a muscle protein released during muscle damage; this appears in the urine and can cause acute renal failure."
urinary system,415,"A 62-year-old man presented with difficulty in walking. He had a past history of diabetes mellitus and cervical spondylosis, which had required surgical decompression eight years previously. He drank 40 units of alcohol weekly. On examination there was fasciculation, wasting and weakness in the left deltoid and biceps, with weakness in the shoulder girdle muscles bilaterally. There was fasciculation in the glutei and quadriceps bilaterally, weakness of hip flexion and foot dorsiflexion, brisk reflexes in upper and lower limbs, and extensor plantar responses. There was no sensory impairment. What is the diagnosis?",Alcoholic myopathy,Diabetic amyotrophy,Motor neurone disease,Recurrent cervical cord compression,Syringomyelia,C,"There are signs of lower (wasting, fasciculations) and upper (brisk reflexes, extensor plantar response) motor neuron involvement in the presence of normal sensation. Motor neuron disease is the most common cause of such presentation. Alcoholic myopathy and diabetic amyotrophy do not share upper motor neuron signs. Syringomyelia presents with sensory symptoms and signs (spinothalamic). You expect sensory involvement with cervical cord compression."
urinary system,416,"A 40-year-old woman who has recently returned from working in the middle east complains of thirst, episode of loin pain, urinary frequency, dysuria and has passed a urinary stone. All investigations are normal. She plans to return to the Middle East in a month’s time. What is the single best advice to prevent recurrent stone formation?",Drink less milk,High fibre diet,Increase fluid intake,Low calcium diet,Low protein diet,C,"Risk factors for renal stones include being overweight, certain foods, some medications, and not drinking enough fluids"
urinary system,417,A 27 year old female presents to her GP with recurrent UTIs. An intravenous urography is organised and there is evidence of radial linear striations and there is evidence of ectactic collecting ducts. She has no other past medical history of note. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Polycystic kidney disease,Tuberculosis of the kidney,Renal cell carcinoma,Medullary cystic disease,Medullary sponge kidney,E,"The IV urography findings are suggestive of medullary sponge kidney. It is a congenital disorder which can be unilateral or bilateral which leads to ectactic and cystic changes of the medullary and papillary collecting ducts. Small calculi can develop within the cysts. It is most frequently associated with congenital hemihypertrophy. However other associations include Marfans syndrome and Ehlers Danlos. It can be found incidentally or present with haematuria, recurrent UTIs or renal calculi."
urinary system,418,Patient with suspected Vesicovaginal fistula (VVF). How to be diagnosed?,MRI,CT urogram,Cysto-urethroscopy,Color Doppler ultrasonography,Examination under anaesthesia,C,"Diagnosis and management of vesicovaginal fistulae CystoscopyIt is the authors’ practice to perform cystourethroscopy for all but the largest defects. This allows determination of the exact level and position of the fistula with relation to the ureteric orifices and bladder neck. This will be important in determining the appropriate surgical technique and the likelihood of subsequent urethral incompetence. The condition of the tissues must be carefully assessed, as the persistence of slough should defer definitive repair surgery. Malignant change has been reported in long-standing benign fistulae thus, if there is any doubt about the nature of the tissue, biopsy should be undertaken"
urinary system,419,Which visual field defect is most likely to occur with multiple sclerosis?,Bitemporal hemianopia,Central scotoma,Homonymous hemianopia,Increased blind spot,Tunnel vision,B,"Central scotoma is an area of reduced vision that corresponds with the point of fixation and, therefore, interferes with central vision. It suggests a lesion between the optic nerve head and the chiasm. Central scotoma is likely with retrobulbar neuritis and optic atrophy. Tunnel vision occurs in:  Glaucoma Retinitis pigmentosa, and Retinal panphotocoagulation.  Increased blind spot occurs with papilloedema, which may lead to optic atrophy. Optic chiasma compression causes bitemporal hemianopia."
urinary system,420,A previously well 92-year-old patient with a history of hypertension presents to the Emergency department with a right sided hemiplegia and dysphasia. An urgent CT carried out 1.5 hours after the onset of symptoms shows a cerebral infarction affecting the left hemisphere. Up to how many hours after the onset of symptoms can alteplase be given in the treatment of this patient?,3 hours,4.5 hours,6 hours,9 hours,Alteplase is contraindicated as the patient is aged over 80 years,B,"According to NICE guidelines on the diagnosis and initial management of stroke and transient ischaemic attacks, thrombolysis with alteplase can be given up to 4.5 hours from the known onset of symptoms as long as a haemorrhagic stroke is excluded and there are no contraindications to thrombolysis. It should be remembered that the benefits of thrombolysis diminish with time. "
urinary system,421,What is the mechanism of action of tetrabenazine?,Activates GABAa receptors,Antimuscarinic,Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist,Monoamine oxidase inhibitor,VMAT inhibitor (vesicular monoamine transporter-2),E,"Tetrabenazine works as a VMAT-inhibitor (vesicular monoamine transporter 2), involved in transportation of monoamines. It is indicated for Huntington's chorea to reduce hyperkinetic movements. Benzodiazepines activate GABAa receptors. Antimuscarinic drugs include trihexyphenidyl used in Parkinson's disease. Dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists include amlodipine. Selegiline is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor used in Parkinson's disease."
urinary system,422,A 29-year-old woman who has a history of epilepsy comes to the clinic complaining of worsening hair loss. She has generalised tonic clonic seizures and has been taking her medication for the past two to three years. Her epilepsy is currently well controlled. Which of the following medications is she most likely to be taking?,Carbamazepine,Gabapentin,Lamotrigine,Valproate,Vigabatrin,D,"Up to 12% of patients taking sodium valproate report significant hair loss in clinical trials. Of course, as hair loss is relatively common, other causes of hair loss should be excluded before changing anti-epileptic medication. Carbamazepine hair loss is recognised, but is only seen in around 6% of patients. Limited data suggest zinc or selenium supplementation may be associated with reduced hair loss, but these data are somewhat controversial. "
urinary system,423,In which of the following patients is an ACE inhibitor contraindicated?,"A 24-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes and microalbuminuria, who wants to start a family",A 28-year-old woman with reflux nephropathy and hypertension,A 34-year-old man with essential hypertension and a BMI of 32,A 34-year-old woman with hypertension and a horseshoe kidney,A 62-year-old type 2 diabetes patient who has microalbuminuria and a stable creatinine of 210,A,"ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy. There is an increase in congenital cardiac and neurological abnormalities^1 and despite the fact this woman has microalbuminuria, use of an ACE inhibitor is not recommended. In patients with elevated creatinine and microalbuminuria, use of an ACE inhibitor is still a reasonable option, as it has been proven to delay both further deterioration of creatinine and worsening albuminuria. With respect to essential hypertension and a raised BMI, an ACE inhibitor may be appropriate; other options include a calcium antagonist. Regarding beta blockers and thiazides, evidence suggests they may increase insulin resistance and risk of diabetes, hence you may choose to avoid them here. Other contraindications to ACE inhibition include:  angio-oedema breastfeeding, and significant renal artery stenosis.  "
urinary system,424,"In Fanconis syndrome there is a type 2 renal tubular acidosis along with aminoaciduria, glycosuria and phosphaturia.  Which of the following is also a presenting feature of fanconis syndrome?",Anaemia,Osteomalacia,Thrombocytopenia,Fatigue,Mental retardation,B,Due to the loss of excessive calcium and phosphate and a defect in the hydroxylation of 25 hydroxyvitamin D. Osteomalacia is a common presenting feature in adults.
urinary system,425,"A 30-year-old female presents with weight gain, some hair loss and a tremor six months after commencing single drug treatment. Which one of the following drugs is most likely to be responsible for her symptoms?",Carbamazepine,Lamotrigine,Phenytoin,Sodium valproate,Topiramate,D,Sodium valproate is associated with:  Weight gain Tremor Hair loss Teratogenicity Polycystic ovary disease.  Lamotrigine is associated with skin rash (and Stevens-Johnson syndrome in severe cases). Topiramate is associated with:  Renal stones Weight loss Cognitive impairment Tingling in extremities.  Phenytoin is associated with:  Peripheral neuropathy Cerebellum syndrome Acne Hirsutism Gingival hypertrophy Hypocalcaemia.
urinary system,426,"A 34-year-old man with polycystic kidney disease attends the transplant clinic with his 19-year-old brother. His most recent creatinine has been measured at 342 µmol/L, and he is on several anti-hypertensive drugs and erythropoietin injections to maintain his haemoglobin, which was recently measured as 104 g/L. On examination his BP is 149/87 mmHg. Other findings are consistent with chronic renal failure. His father had end stage renal failure for some years before his death. Which of the following most accurately reflects the chances of his brother also being affected by polycystic kidney disease?",0%,25%,33%,50%,100%,D,"Adult polycystic kidney disease (APCKD) carries an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. As such, with one affected parent, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the PCKD gene. Homozygotes are usually severely affected as neonates or die in utero.  Whilst ultrasound is very sensitive in detection of APCKD in patients over 20, in those under 20 it is not 100% accurate. It may not seem immediately obvious to consider a family member as a potential donor, but they may be a valuable source for a kidney in this situation."
urinary system,427,"A 48-year-old woman patient presents to the medical intake with bilateral leg swelling. Urine dipstick shows 4+ protein and serum albumin is 14 g/l (normal range 35-50 g/l). Renal function is within normal range. Further urinalysis indicates nephrotic-range proteinuria. Further to this, a renal biopsy is performed which shows thickened glomerular capillary loops. Which of the following may be a cause for this presentation?",Candida spp.,Escherichia coli 0157:H7,Helicobacter pylori,Hepatitis B,Mycoplasma spp.,D,"Membranous nephropathy is the second most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults in western countries, accounting for 22-33% of cases and coming in just behind focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. It is primary (idiopathic) in two-thirds of cases. Secondary causes include:  autoimmune disease infections drugs (captopril, gold, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), or malignancy.  Infectious causes of membranous nephropathy include:  hepatitis B hepatitis C syphilis, and malaria.  It can also be seen in HIV although this disease is more often associated with a focal glomerulosclerosis. Candida spp. are not causes of membranous nephropathy. Although related to haemolytic-uraemic syndrome, Escherichia coli 0157 is not a cause of membranous nephropathy. H. pylori is related to peptic ulcer disease and is not a cause of membranous nephropathy. Hepatitis B is a secondary cause of membranous nephropathy and patients with this syndrome should be tested. Although a cause of atypical pneumonia, Mycoplasma spp. is not a cause of membranous nephropathy."
urinary system,428,"A 14 year old girl is suffering from thirst and increased urination.  She is found to have a hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic alkalosis and hypomagnesaemia.  A 24 hour urine collection reveals hypocalciuria and an ECG QT prolongation.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Type 4 renal tubular acidosis,Bartters syndrome,Gitelmans syndrome,Type 1 renal tubular acidosis,Liddles syndrome,C,"Bartters syndrome is a combination of juxtaglomerular hyperplasia, hyperaldosteronism and hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic alkalosis often with hypercalciuria.  It is autosomal recessive.  There is reduced sodium and chloride absorption and excessive aldosterone production resulting in the biochemical abnormalities.  It can lead to renal stones due to the hypercalciuria.  Type 1 and Type 4 RTA leads to metabolic acidosis.  Gitelmans syndrome is similar but presents later and is more common.  There is also hypocalciuria and as opposed to hypercalciuria and hypomagnesaemia.  Prolonged QT syndrome can be seen in Gitelmans syndrome.  Liddles syndrome is not associated with high aldosterone although does lead to hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic alkalosis but no hypercalciuria."
urinary system,429,"An 80-year-old man presented to his GP having developed uncontrollable flinging movements of his right arm and leg in the last few days. He had been previously well prior to the event. The movements were irregular involving the proximal limb muscles and did not follow a particular pattern. They occurred several times a minute and had led to several falls. He had a past medical history of hypertension and ischaemic heart disease and took regular Ramipril and Aspirin. He was a smoker of 10 cigarettes per day and did not drink any alcohol. There was no family history of neurological disease. On examination he was alert and orientated, but had several episodes of flinging proximal movements of his right upper and lower limb that made examination difficult. Tone, power and reflexes all appeared normal and there were no obvious cranial nerve abnormalities. General examination revealed a blood pressure of 140/90 mmHg, pulse of 78/min and regular and heart sounds were normal. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 152 g/L (130 - 180)   Mean cell volume 92 fL (80 - 96)   White cell count 10.5 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelets 299 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Serum sodium 135 mmol/L (137 - 144)   Serum potassium 4.5 mmol/L (3.5 - 4.9)   Serum urea 3.6 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.5)   Serum creatinine 98 umol/L (60 - 110)   Fasting plasma glucose 8.9 mmol/L (3 - 6)   Serum cholesterol 6.2 mmol/L (less than5.2)    What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Functional disorder,Huntington disease,Infarction within the substantia nigra,Infarction within the subthalamic nucleus,Senile chorea,D,"The patient presents with a history in keeping with hemiballism. The presence of severe flinging movements affecting proximal muscles and following no particular pattern is typical for hemiballism. The site of the lesion is in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus, infarction being the commonest cause. The patient has several arteriosclerotic risk factors including hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, ischaemic heart disease and diabetes. Usually the flinging movements stop spontaneously in the next 4-8 weeks and tetrabenazine is the treatment of choice. Bilateral ballismus is rare and implicates a metabolic cause usually non-ketotic hyperosmolar coma."
urinary system,430,Which of the following is not a cause of normal anion gap metabolic acidosis?,Addisons,Proximal renal tubular acidosis,Ammonium Chloride Ingestion,Ketoacidosis,Distal renal tubular acidosis,D,The anion gap ((Na)+(K))-((Cl)+HCO3)). All the options lead to a normal anion gap apart from ketoacidosis which leads to an increase in unmeasured anions.
urinary system,431,Which of the following is not a complication of nephrotic syndrome?,Accelerated hypertension,Acute renal failure,Hypocalcaemia,Pneumococcal infection,Venous thrombosis,A,"Complications also include hyperlipidaemia, protein malnutrition and loss of binding proteins in urine. Acute renal failure may be seen due to the underlying condition, but can also be directly due to the nephrotic syndrome possibly due to a reduction in the ultrafiltration coefficient within the kidney. Hypocalcaemia is seen due to loss of vitamin-D binding protein in the urine. Susceptibility to infection, in particular, pneumococcal infections, is thought to be due to increased IgG excretion in the urine, reduced complement function and decreased splanchnic blood flow. Venous thrombosis risk is increased due to the loss of antithrombin III in the urine."
urinary system,432,"A 35-year-old, HIV-positive, African woman presented with weakness of both legs and double incontinence. CSF showed increased protein and neutrophils with normal glucose. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her weakness?",CMV polyradiculomyelopathy,Guillain-Barré syndrome,Herpes virus encephalitis,HIV encephalopathy,Toxoplasma encephalitis,A,"Symptoms are suggestive of polyradiculomyelopathy (weakness of legs with involvement of sphincters). Increased neutrophils are found in CMV polyradiculomyelopathy but not in Guillain-Barré syndrome. HIV encephalopathy usually causes confusion and memory loss. It does not involve sphincters. Guillain-Barré syndrome causes polyradiculopathy, explaining all her symptoms, but with normal cell counts and raised protein in the CSF. Herpes simplex encephalitis causes fever, headache, confusion, and deteriorating level of consciousness.   HIV infection is a risk factor for infection with other atypical organisms such as CMV."
urinary system,433,A 47-year-old Portuguese former intravenous drug abuser presented with a two-week history of right hemiparesis. He was found to have hepatitis B and C infection. His absolute lymphocyte count was 0.6 ×10^9/L. CT of the head showed multiple ring-enhanced lesions. Which of the following would be your next best course of action?,Manage him conservatively with physiotherapy,Refer him to a neurosurgeon for urgent brain biopsy,Refer him to a stroke specialist,Request an HIV antibody test,Start thrombolysis treatment,D,"This man was already infected with two blood-borne viruses (hepatitis B and C). His absolute lymphocyte count was low. CT scan showed multiple ring-enhanced lesions, which were suggestive of cerebral toxoplasmosis. Therefore, testing HIV is the next best course of action. Finding multiple ring-enhanced lesions on CT scan needs further investigations for suspect toxoplasmosis. Managing conservatively with physiotherapy is not an appropriate course of action. CT scan is not typical of brain tumour, hence referring him for urgent brain biopsy is not the best course of action. Thrombolysis treatment should not be started, as the CT scan was not typical of ischaemic stroke. "
urinary system,434,Mesh complications should be reported to which of the following?,Court,CMACE,GMC,MHRA,NHS,D,"Mesh safety alertSurgeons should only undertake operations for SUI if they are appropriately trained, and only if they undertake operations regularly Surgeons report every procedure to a national database A register of operations is maintained to ensure every procedure is notified and the woman identified who has undergone the surgery Reporting of complications via MHRA is linked to the register"
urinary system,435,Optic ataxia refers to difficulty in which of the following?,Controlling hand-eye coordination,Moving the eyes,Colour vision,Facial recognition,Shifting gaze,A,"Examining for optic ataxia can be done by asking the patient to reach out and touch an object. Unlike cerebellar problems there is no tremor. The patient clearly grabs in the wrong part of space and does not attempt to correct unlike cerebellar lesions. Optic apraxia is the term used to describe difficultly shifting gaze. Both optic ataxia and optic apraxia together with simultagnosia are referred to as Balint's syndrome. Achromatopsia describes a difficultly with colour vision. Prosopagnosia describes an inability to recognise faces, which is controlled by the fusiform gyrus in the temporal lobe."
urinary system,436,"A 45-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse presents with a two day history of deteriorating confusion. On examination he is drowsy, has a temperature of 39°C, a pulse of 110 beats per minute, a small amount of ascites and has features of a left side hemiparesis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral abscess,Cerebro-vascular accident,Hepatic encephalopathy,Subdural haematoma,Wernicke's encephalopathy,A,"The combination of fever and focal neurological signs makes a cerebral abscess the most likely diagnosis here. The history of alcohol abuse is a risk factor. Onset may be sudden or subacute over several weeks. Presenting symptoms include fever, headache, drowsiness, confusion, nausea, vomiting, focal neurological deficits and seizures. Rupture can result in a sudden headache with meningism. Whilst a subdural haematoma would be a possibility, it would not really explain the fevers or tachycardia. A CVA would also not explain the fever. Whilst the patient is at risk of hepatic encephalopathy and Wernicke's, these would not explain the left hemiparesis."
urinary system,437,Patient is diagnosed to have stress incontinence with large cystocele. What is the initial management?,Anterior repair,Anterior repair with mesh,Posterior repair,Sling operation,Urodynamic tests,E,"Urodynamic testing in stress incontinence Do not perform multichannel filling and voiding cystometry beforeprimary surgery if stress urinary incontinence or stress-predominant mixed urinary incontinence is diagnosed based on a detailed clinical history and demonstrated stress urinary incontinence at examinationAfter undertaking a detailed clinical history and examination, perform multichannel filling and voiding cystometry before surgery for stress urinary incontinence in women who have any of the following :Urge-predominant mixed urinary incontinence or urinary incontinence in which the type is unclear Symptoms suggestive of voiding dysfunction Anterior or apical prolapse A history of previous surgery for stress urinary incontinence."
urinary system,438,"A 35-year-old man presented with hematuria, abdominal swelling and has a BP of 190/140. What is the most diagnostic investigation?",Cystoscopy,USG,CT,Renal biopsy,Urine analysis,B,"The diagnosis is ADPKD.Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a genetic disorder characterized by the growth of numerous cysts in the kidneys. It is the most common inherited disorder of the kidneys. Symptoms usually develop between the ages of 30 and 40, but they can begin earlier, even in childhood.Haematuria, abdominal swelling and raised BP are the most common findings.

The clinical signs include  Papilloedema Cranial nerves III, IV and VI  Ocular chemosis and Proptosis."
urinary system,440,"A 40-year-old male presents to the Emergency department with weakness and paraesthesia of the right arm and leg. The symptoms developed 12 hours after the onset of a piercing left sided headache. There is no neck stiffness, but there is a pain in the left side of the neck and occiput. Kernig's sign is negative. The patient is afebrile, and blood results are normal. What is the single best investigation of choice?",Contrast arteriography of the neck vessels,CT head,Duplex scanning of the neck vessels,Lumbar puncture,MRI brain,A,"Ischaemic neurological features (transient or completed strokes) are found in 30-80% of patients presenting with carotid artery dissection. Pulsatile tinnitus is common, as well as syncope and amaurosis fugax. Headache is commonly ipsilateral to the side of the carotid dissection, and recurrence of the headache suggests extension or recurrence of the dissection. As it is the most accurate study and the current gold standard for diagnosis of carotid artery dissection, contrast arteriography should be strongly considered, if there is mono or hemiparesis with normal mental state, signs or history of major cervical trauma with abnormal neurology, or basilar skull fracture in a patient with altered mental status. Obviously in practice many trusts will require a CT head first. Additionally in the absence of arteriography, duplex scanning or MRI with MRA may be considered the next best tests. However limitations of duplex scanning include difficulties of scanning the distal internal carotid artery, detecting emboli, and evaluating intracranial arteries. The combination of MRI and MRA is more reliable in detecting dissection than either modality alone. Lumbar puncture results may be misleading, as xanthochromia may occur when a haematoma propagates. This rare finding may lead to a misdiagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage and failure to perform further carotid workup."
urinary system,441,A 65-year-old woman with a history of recurrent urinary tract infections attends the Emergency Department with loin pain and haematuria. She is diagnosed with renal stones the composition of which is magnesium ammonium phosphate. Which of the following organisms are likely to be implicated in her urinary infections?,Bacteroides fragilis,Enterococcus faecalis,Escherichia coli,Proteus mirabilis,Staphylococcus aureus,D,Triple phosphate stones are classically produced by urea-splitting organisms such as Klebsiella or Proteus. Bacteroides fragilis and Enterococcus faecalis are bowel commensals but do not produce triple phosphate stones and so these answers are incorrect. Escherichia coli is a common urinary tract pathogen but it is not associated with triple phosphate stones. Staphylococcus aureus is rarely a urinary pathogen and is not associated with the production of triple phosphate stones. 
urinary system,442,A 27-year-old man presents with a two year history of intermittent tingling sensation involving his left side. It starts in his fingers and spreads in 10-20 seconds to affect the whole arm and leg on the same side. The attacks only last for one minute. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Hyperventilation,Migraine with aura,Multiple sclerosis,Somatosensory seizures,Transient ischaemic attacks,D,"Positive symptoms (jerking, tingling) usually signify epilepsy. Negative symptoms (weakness, numbness) are usually caused by transient focal ischaemia. Spread of symptoms ('marching') indicates migraine (in 5-20 minutes) or seizures (in seconds). The usual source of somatosensory seizures is the parietal lobe."
urinary system,443,A 25-year-old woman presents with a severe migraine. Which of the following is not a recognised feature of migraine?,Bilateral fortification spectra,External ophthalmoplegia,Precipitation by oral contraceptives,Frequency reduced by tricyclic antidepressants,Third nerve palsy,B,"Fortification spectra (jagged lines resembling battlements) and teichopsia (flashes) are common features of migraine. Tricyclics can be useful in the prophylaxis of migraine, whereas oral contraceptives may worsen pre-existing migraine or change the pattern of attacks. They are generally contraindicated in those who suffer from migraine with aura.  Third nerve palsy is seen in ophthalmoplegic migraine, although this was reclassified as a cranial neuralgia in the most recent International Headache Society classification. It most commonly affects the third nerve, and the deficits can be permanent. A subset of these patients will have gadolinium enhancement of the cisternal segment of the cranial nerve and it is thought some of these patients actually have a demyelinating neuropathy.  Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia usually develops in childhood and is associated with ptosis, fatigue and limitation to eye- movements in all directions. It is associated with cytochrome deficiency."
urinary system,444,"A 30-year-old woman presents with problems seeing for the past two days. She reports that the vision of her left eye is much worse than normal for the last two days. She reports that she woke up and thought there was something in her eye but the vision is getting worse. She denies diplopia but has blurred vision. On examination her visual acuity is 20/20 in the right eye and finger counting only in the left. There is red desaturation and a relative afferent papillary defect. Her past medical history is unremarkable and she reports never having had neurological symptoms in the past. On examination of her fundus, what is the most likely finding?",Cupped disc,Macular star,Normal optic disc,Optic atrophy,Papilloedema,C,Most cases of optic neuritis are retrobulbar and hence there are no abnormalities on fundoscopy. Obtaining an MRI with gadolinium of the brain will likely show enhancement of the optic nerve on the left. The patient has a clinically isolated syndrome presenting as retrobulbar neuritis. The concern for the patient to develop MS would be high given this initial presentation. Optic atrophy occurs over a longer period of time. Papilloedema suggests increased intracranial pressure. A macular star is a finding seen in some inflammatory diseases but not in optic neuritis. A cupped disc is seen in glaucoma.
urinary system,445,"A 20-year-old woman presents to the acute medical intake with lethargy and confusion. On examination you note a purpuric rash covering the abdominal wall and thighs and a fever of 38°C. Investigations reveal a haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute kidney injury. Which feature of the presentation makes the diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura more likely than haemolytic-uraemic syndrome?",Acute kidney injury,Confusion,Fever,Haemolytic anaemia,Thrombocytopenia,B,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) have overlapping clinical features, with up to 60% of TTP patients missing at least one component of the classical pentad and around 30% of HUS patients having neurological symptoms and fever. Acute kidney injury can be present in both conditions. It is typically more severe in haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. Neurological symptoms are much less common in patients presenting with haemolytic-uraemic syndrome. Fever, haemolytic anaemia, and thrombocytopenia can be present in both conditions."
urinary system,446,"A 70-year-old man presents with difficulty speaking. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination the patient is awake, his blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg. His pulse is irregularly irregular. He has 4/5 strength in the right arm and leg and 5/5 strength on the left. When asked to point to the window he does this correctly. When told to raise his arms and place his hands out he is seen to have a pronator drift on the right. He is shown a pen and asked what it is. He responds fluently but makes some paraphasic errors. He is asked to use it appropriately and begins to write on a piece of paper. When asked to repeat 'Today is a sunny day', he is unable to do so. Which of the following terms best describes these signs?",Anomic aphasia,Broca's aphasia,Conduction aphasia,Transcortical motor aphasia,Transcortical sensory aphasia,C,"In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In transcortical motor aphasia, which localises to the anterior superior frontal lobe, the patient is has good comprehension and repetition but has halting, effortful speech. Patients also have impaired writing skills. Transcortical sensory aphasia is characterised by impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech, and is caused by damage to the temporal lobes. It differs from Wernicke's aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition, and exhibit cholalia (the compulsive repetition of words). Improvement may be seen with speech therapy. Anomic aphasia (also known as nominal aphasia) results in word finding difficulties. On closer examination there may also be repetition problems and comprehension problems but these are typically mild compared to other aphasia syndromes. This scenario describes conduction aphasia. It is characterised by frequent speech errors, impaired repetition, reduced phonological short-term memory and naming difficulties. In contrast to other forms of dysphasia, speech output is otherwise fluent and grammatically correct. Comprehension is intact. It is thought to be caused by left temporo-parietal region damage. "
urinary system,447,An otherwise healthy woman of 30 has a second attack of renal colic in two years and passes a stone. Blood urea is normal. Which one of the following investigations is indicated?,Culture of the urine,Renal biopsy,Serum amino-acid chromatography,Serum phosphate concentration,x Ray of the hands,A,"Further investigation of young patients with a second episode of renal colic is recommended. Clearly urine culture is an important investigation to exclude concurrent infection, and infection associated with stone formation. Hand x ray is not really required, nor is a renal biopsy. A urinary amino-acid chromatography and plasma calcium are also important, and assessment for cystinuria/renal tubular acidosis is also required."
urinary system,448,"A 16-year-old boy presents with rapidly progressive weakness over three days, which is attributed to Guillain-Barré syndrome. Which one of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Azathioprine,Cyclosporin,Immunoglobulin,Methotrexate,Methylprednisolone,C,Randomised controlled trials have shown that human immunoglobulins and plasma exchange improve outcome in Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS). Other immunosuppressive treatment does not have a role in the treatment of GBS.
urinary system,449,A 35-year-old gentleman is admitted complaining of severe right loin pain that radiates to the groin. He reports that the pain seems to come in waves. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Urine microscopy shows red cells but no white cells. An IVU is performed which is reported as showing obstruction at the vesico-ureteric junction. 24 hours later he passes a small stone. What is the most likely biochemical composition of the stone?,Calcium oxalate,Calcium urate,Magnesium ammonium phosphate,Sodium chloride,Xanthine,A,"Oxalate and mixed oxalate/phosphate stones account for around 75% of urinary tract calculi, usually caused by hypercalciuria. Magnesium ammonium phosphate stones account for one sixth and are usually associated with Proteus infection. Xanthine stones are rare. Sodium chloride is readily dissolvable."
urinary system,450,Which of the following is correct regarding the duration of acute tubular necrosis (ATN)?,Prolonged if liver failure is also present,Reduced by calcium channel blockers,Reduced by infusion of dopamine,Reduced by intravenous furosemide,Unrelated to the duration of sepsis,A,"The hepatorenal syndrome is an intractable form of acute renal failure. Renal recovery is unusual in the absence of liver recovery. Calcium channel blockers may cause hypotension. Dopamine infusion has no proven role in acute renal failure in humans, and it may be associated with an increased mortality by vasoconstriction in the mesenteric blood supply. 'Kickstarting' the kidney with furosemide has no role either. It may cause hypotension and thereby prolong ATN. Twenty four hour furosemide infusion has a theoretical role, in that it may limit the oxygen demand, and therefore risk of necrosis in the tubules. ATN is due to ischaemic injury to the kidney, and anything that may cause ischaemia may prolong ATN, (e.g. septic shock). "
urinary system,451,A 68-year-old man presents with progressive visual impairment. On examination there is an incongruous homonymous hemianopia. What is the most likely anatomical site of the neurological lesion?,Chiasma,Occipital lobe,Optic nerve,Optic radiation,Optic tract,E,Causes of visual field defects:  A central scotoma - ipsilateral lesion due to optic nerve damage (e.g. optic neuritis) A bitemporal hemianopia - an optic chiasm lesion An incongruous homonymous hemianopia - an optic tract lesion prior to the geniculate body A homonymous superior quadrantanopia - a temporal lobe lesion A homonymous inferior quadrantanopia - a parietal lobe lesion A homonymous hemianopia - posterior occipital lobe lesion  
urinary system,452,"A 22-year-old woman who is taking long-term doxycycline for severe acne comes to the clinic complaining of chronic thirst and polyuria. She has to pass urine two to three times per night, which is highly unusual for her. There is no significant past medical history, and her only medication is the oral contraceptive pill. On examination, her lying BP is 136/80 mmHg, with a postural drop of 15 mmHg. Her BMI is 29. There were no other significant findings on physical examination. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 138 g/L (115-165)   White cells 6.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 222 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 122 μmol/L (79-118)   Urea 8.5 mmol/L (2.5-6.7)    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Discontinue the doxycycline,Fluid restrict her,Increase her oral fluid intake,Intranasal vasopressin,Oral bendroflumethiazide,A,"The history of polydipsia, polyuria and nocturia, in this case, is typical of diabetes insipidus. From the information given in the stem, we can suggest this is nephrogenic diabetes inspidius secondary to doxycycline. Other drugs which can cause this include lithium, some antifungals and some anti-virals. Whilst increasing her oral intake may relieve some of her symptoms of thirst, discontinuing the doxycycline is the only way to resolve both her thirst and her polyuria. High dose intranasal vasopressin may relieve her symptoms but the most appropriate treatment is discontinuation of the tetracycline antibiotic."
urinary system,453,What is the mechanism of action of fingolimod?,Inhibits IL-2 transcription,Ceramide synthase inhibitor,Interferon agonist,Monoclonal antibody to anti-alpha 4 integrin,Shifts Th1 cell to Th2 cell populations,B,"Fingolimod is a new agent for multiple sclerosis. Its primary mode of action is its activity at the sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1, but it has also been reported to be a cannabinoid receptor antagonist as well as a ceramide synthase inhibitor. It is an immunomodulator, which sequesters lymphocytes in lymph nodes. It has been shown to reduce the rate of relapses in relapsing-remitting MS by over half.  IFN beta-1 is used in multiple sclerosis. Glatiramer acts to shift the T cell population from a pro-inflammatory to a regulatory state, and is also used in MS. Cyclosporin inhibits IL-2 transcription, and is an immunomodulator used in a number of conditions (including transplants). Natalizumab is a monoclonal antibody to alpha-4 integrin. It can be used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis."
urinary system,454,A 70-year-old man has Parkinson's disease. He is started on treatment with L-dopa and dopa decarboxylase inhibitor therapy. However he continues to have troublesome tremor. Which of the following drugs would be most likely to help?,Amantadine,Benzhexol,Propranolol,Ropinirole,Selegiline,B,"Anticholinergic drugs such as benzhexol remain the treatment of choice in parkinsonian tremor. L-dopa, selegiline and dopamine agonists are less effective in tremor. Amantadine can be used as monotherapy in early disease for tremor or bradykinesia, but it has a weak and short-lived benefit. Evidence for efficacy is poor. Propranolol is the treatment of choice in essential tremor. "
urinary system,455,"A 25-year-old woman was recently diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. She has developed weakness, double vision and tiredness. Examination reveals bilateral weakness of eye abduction, bilateral ptosis, slightly reduced proximal motor power in the limbs, normal reflexes and sensation. What is the diagnosis?",Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia,Guillain-Barré syndrome,Multiple sclerosis,Myasthenia gravis,Polymyositis ,D,"Myasthenia gravis is well known to be associated with other autoimmune diseases such as pernicious anaemia, thyroid disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In Guillain-Barré syndrome you would expect absent reflexes. Polymyositis does not usually cause ptosis or ophthalmoplegia."
urinary system,456,"A 43-year-old man presented with diplopia of six weeks duration. On examination he had normal corrected visual acuity in each eye, restriction of adduction of the right eye and nystagmus in the left eye on left lateral gaze. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Brainstem demyelination,Graves' ophthalmopathy,Internal carotid artery aneurysm,Lateral medullary syndrome,Steele-Richardson syndrome,A,"The features are suggestive of internuclear ophthalmoplegia which is due to a lesion at the medial longitudinal fasciculus and in this male the most likely explanation is multiple sclerosis (MS). Other causes include brainstem infarction, syphilis and Lyme disease."
urinary system,457,Which of the following is correct in hypospadias?,A chordee is usually present,Circumcision should be performed to minimise the risk of urinary tract infection,Surgery should be undertaken around puberty when penile growth is complete,The defect occurs on the dorsum of the penis in 65% of cases,The incidence is approximately 0.3% of male infants,E,"Hypospadias, which is a defect in the ventral aspect occurs in three in 1000 births. Epispadius is a defect in the dorsal aspect of the penis and this is much rarer occurring in one in 30,000 births. Therefore the majority have hypospadias (ventral aspect). It may occur on its own but is associated with exstrophy of the bladder (when the bladder mucosa is exposed to the outside). The abnormalities associated with abnormal opening of the urethral meatus include:  A hooded prepuce (foreskin formed completely only on the dorsum) Chordee: ventral curvature, present only in the worst cases. The incidence is 0.3% of males and surgery is usually undertaken before the age of 2 in order to create a terminal urethral meatus and a straight erection.  The foreskin is essential for surgical correction and should always be preserved."
urinary system,458,What is the agent responsible for variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)?,Mutant mitochondrial DNA,Non-protein transmissible pathogen,Proteinaceous infectious particle,Retrovirus,Slow virus,C,"Variant CJD is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. It is associated with the accumulation of an abnormal isoform of a normal host protein (prion protein) in the central nervous system. This prion protein has no sequence differences from the normal protein, being encoded by the same normal host gene, but there is a major difference in the conformation of the two forms with the prion protein containing less helix structure. The predominance of this structure confers a remarkable resistance to degradation and allows the protein to accumulate within the central nervous system. The other answers are associated with other infective mechanisms though these are not seen in vCJD."
urinary system,459,A patient had passed a 4 mm stone in his urine. He has a 3 mm stone in the renal pelvis found on US. What is the management?,ESWL,None,Dormier basket,Surgery,PCNL (percutaneous nephrolithotomy),B,Stones less than 5 mm in diameter pass spontaneously in up to 80% of people. Stones between 5 mm and 10 mm in diameter pass spontaneously in about 50% of people. Stones larger than 1 cm in diameter usually require intervention (urgent intervention is required if complete obstruction or infection is present). Two thirds of stones that pass spontaneously will do so within four weeks of onset of symptoms
urinary system,460,"A 50-year-old man is admitted with cardiogenic shock due to an acute myocardial infarction. His urine output drops over the next few days. His serum urea increases to 18 mmol/L (2.5-7.5), with creatinine of 300 µmol/L (60-110). Urinalysis reveals no protein or glucose, a trace blood, and numerous hyaline casts. Several days later he develops polyuria and his serum urea and creatinine fall. Which of the following pathologic findings is most likely to be seen in his kidneys?",Fusion of podocyte foot processes,Glomerular crescents,Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis,Mesangial immune complex deposition,Patchy tubular necrosis,E,"He would have findings of ischaemic acute tubular necrosis from cardiogenic shock. Fusion of podocyte foot processes is seen in minimal change glomerulonephritis. Glomerular crescents can complicate any glomerulopathy but, along with mesangial immune complex deposition, is usually an immune-mediated process. Hyperplastic arteriolosclerosis is the 'onion skin' appearance of arterioles in malignant hypertension. "
urinary system,461,"A 28-year-old man is referred to you by the practice nurse for hypertension management. She has seen him three times over the past four months and his BP is persistently elevated at around 155/92 mmHg. Your partner has seen him previously for some non-specific right upper quadrant abdominal pain. On examination of the abdomen, you can feel bilateral enlarged kidneys and a liver edge. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 6.4 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 182 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 182 μmol/L (60-120)   Glucose 4.5 mmol/L (less than6.0)   Urine Blood ++   Protein -    Which one of the following is most closely associated with his underlying condition?",Aortic stenosis,Coarctation of the aorta,Diabetes mellitus,Mitral valve prolapse,Tricuspid stenosis,D,"A young man presenting with renal failure, haematuria and liver and renal masses raises the suspicion of polycystic kidney disease. Associated liver cysts are found in around 80% of individuals with polycystic kidney disease. Pancreatic cysts are rarer, and may in some cases be associated with recurrent pancreatitis. Patients are at increased risk of renal stones, but the predominant increase is seen in urate stones, rather than other types. Up to 25% of patients may have some degree of mitral valve prolapse. MODY 5 is associated with hepatic and renal cysts and diabetes mellitus, but that is less likely to be the diagnosis here in the presence of a normal glucose. Polycystic kidney disease carries an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance but may occur as a de novo mutation in 5%."
urinary system,462,"A 45-year-old female primary school teacher presents with shortness of breath and weakness. There is a diarrhoeal illness going around her school. She is normally fit and well, and takes no medication. On examination she has marked weakness in her left and right legs, power 2/5 in ankle and knee extension, increasing to 3/5 in hip extension. There is an absence of knee and ankle reflexes, with an absent plantar reflex. Sensation is intact. Considering the likely diagnosis, what test would you order next?",Anti-GQ1b antibodies,Campylobacter jejuni antibody level,CT brain,Nerve conduction testing,Vital capacity,E,"It is likely that this lady has Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), an immune-mediated acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. It often follows infection, especially viral or Campylobacter jeuni . Its most common presentation is with progressive, symmetric, ascending weakness, with hyporeflexia, with or without autonomic and sensory features. In severe cases it can affect respiratory and cardiovascular function. Therefore, especially given that this lady feels breathless; it is of utmost importance to record her vital capacity, and to monitor it until recovery, as approximately 30% of patients require intubation. GBS is usually a clinical diagnosis as treatment and ITU admission need to be organised urgently. Campylobacter jejuni serology may help to find the precipitant of GBS, however only 40% of cases have positive serology, and it will not save this patient's life. CT brain will be of little help as this patient is demonstrating lower motor neurone signs (flaccid paralysis with hyporeflexia). Nerve conduction studies will show a slowing/delay in conduction, this will help to confirm your diagnosis, but will not save her life. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are found in Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of GBS, with ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia"
urinary system,463,The Achilles reflex is supplied by which of the following?,L5,L5/S1,L4/L5,S1/S2,S2-S4,D,"The Achilles reflex or ankle jerk can be absent from disc herniation at L5/S1 due to S1 impingement. It is supplied by the sciatic nerve. It tests both the S1 and S2 nerve roots, although some texts state the S1 nerve root only. The L5 reflex is tested by tapping the medial hamstrings, but is typically cumbersome to do and not tested. It is the asymmetry which is important as it is not necessarily present. S2-4 reflex is part of the anocutaneous reflex or anal wink."
urinary system,464,"A 17-year-old female presents with three headaches over a six month period. She describes the headaches as severe, right-sided and lasting for twelve hours and associated with nausea and photophobia. Each is preceded by spots before her eyes. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?",Diclofenac at the onset of the next attack,Ergotamine suppository at the onset of the next attack,Paracetamol plus metoclopramide at the onset of the next attack,Prophylaxis with propranolol,Sumatriptan at the onset of the next attack,E,"This history is consistent with a migraine. NICE guidelines state that an oral triptan and an NSAID or paracetamol should be used for the acute treatment of migraine. If these are not tolerated or ineffective, non-oral preparations of metoclopramide, prochlorperazine, NSAIDs or triptans can be used. Prophylactic topiramate or propranolol can be used if the attacks are numerous or debilitating. Topiramate is associated with foetal malformations, and therefore it should be offered in conjunction with appropriate contraception. "
urinary system,465,You are reviewing the guidelines for GP referral to the hospital service for possible renal artery stenosis because of an increase in the number of referrals over the past few months. Which of the following correctly reflects a criterion for a patient who should be referred for further investigations?,BP greater than150/90 mmHg despite 2 anti-hypertensives,Fall of GFR greater than10% during first 2 months after starting an ACE inhibitor,Fall of GFR greater than15% over 12 months,Pulmonary oedema with reduced LV function,Unexplained hyperkalaemia with hypertension,C,"Current UK guidelines with regard to chronic kidney disease recommend referral for further investigation of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis when there is:  Refractory hypertension (BP greater than150/90 mmHg despite 3 antihypertensives) Recurrent episodes of pulmonary oedema despite normal left ventricular function Rise of greater than20% serum creatinine or fall of GFR greater than15% over 12 months with high clinical suspicion of widespread atherosclerosis, or during the first 2 months after initiation with an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.

urinary system,466,"A 66-year-old gentleman with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia is admitted with a rise in creatinine from 100 µmol/L to 300 µmol/L from a routine blood test done in the community. The admitting team requests an ultrasound of the kidneys which shows normal sized kidneys with no evidence of hydronephrosis. Of the options below, select the most appropriate size of a normal adult kidney on ultrasound appearance (measured longitudinally).",6 cm,11 cm,15 cm,18 cm,20 cm,B,"Ultrasonography plays a crucial part in evaluating acute and chronic renal impairment. In this case of suspected prostatic obstruction, it is important to exclude hydronephrosis. In the adult population, the usual range of kidney size measured longitudinally is between 9-12 cm. The other options fall out of this range and should therefore not be selected. "
urinary system,467,"A 29-year-old woman comes to the clinic because she is concerned that her left pupil is abnormally large. Her boyfriend noticed it and suggested she should see the doctor. She has no past medical history of note, apart from an episode of shingles a few months earlier, and takes the oral contraceptive pill as her only medication. On further questioning she admits to unprotected sexual intercourse on two to three occasions over the past three to four years. On examination her left pupil is clearly larger than the right. It hardly reacts to light at all, but does accommodate to near vision. You notice that re-dilatation is very slow however. Her BP is normal at 132/72 mmHg, and general physical examination is unremarkable. How best can you confirm the diagnosis?",Chest x ray,Lumbar puncture,MRI brain,Reaction to weak miotic eye drops,Syphilis serology,D,"This history is typical of an Adie's tonic pupil, which is characteristically seen in young women, and may occur after an episode of zoster infection. At the beginning of the condition the pupil is large, but over time becomes small and poorly reactive. Slit lamp examination may reveal small worm like contractions of the iris, but the usual diagnostic test is to use weak pilocarpine eye drops, which induce vigorous pupil contraction on the affected side, but only weak contraction of the pupil on the unaffected side. In adults it tends to be a benign condition and is simply observed, however infants are usually referred because of an association with familial dystonias. The Argyll Robertson pupil has an absent light reflex, whereas in this case the light reflex is merely reduced."
urinary system,468,An 18-year-old female student attends the clinic as her father has just died with end-stage renal failure. He had been diagnosed with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). She wishes to know what investigations she requires. Which of the following is an appropriate strategy in her management?,Geneticist referral,Glomerular filtration rate estimation,MRI brain,Ultrasound of the renal tract,Urine dipstick,A,"An ultrasound of the renal tract may not be appropriate at this patient's age, given that cysts may not become apparent until the age of 20. Gross haematuria in ADPKD carries a poor prognosis however microscopic haematuria may be a complication. Subarachnoid haemorrhage may be a cause of mortality in 9% of patients with ADPKD, though 8% of patients have an asymptomatic intracranial aneurysm; if the diagnosis is confirmed and there is a strong history of subarachnoid haemorrhage then an MRI would be indicated. Genetic counselling is most appropriate in this context and genetic linkage analysis may be utilised."
urinary system,469,A 34-year-old male presents with back pain and weakness. Which of the following would support a diagnosis of prolapsed intervertebral disc?,Bilateral symmetrical nerve involvement,Loss of sensation over the left outer upper thigh,No evidence of nerve compression,Pain which is unremitting in character,Pain which is worse on resting,B,"Loss of sensation in the upper outer thigh is consistent with nerve root compression caused by a prolapsed vertebral disc.  'Disc prolapse' actually refers to herniation of the nucleus pulposus, which is usually contained by the annulus fibrosus. This usually occurs on one side, rather than bilaterally, and irritates or compresses the adjacent nerve root resulting in clinical symptoms. This is commonly secondary to disc degeneration, but can also be traumatic. It most often occurs in the lumbar spine, especially L5/S1 which results in sciatica. Symptoms are unilateral leg pain in the distribution of the affected nerve (which is often more severe than the back pain), and numbness, paraesthesia, weakness and/or loss of tendon reflexes in the same distribution. Pain is typically better with rest (although prolonged sitting can worsen it) - if it is unremitting or worse on resting you should consider other causes such as bony metastases or infection. The symptoms described here suggest either the L2 or L3 nerve root is affected."
urinary system,470,"A 40-year-old woman was referred for proteinuria (2.6 g daily). Her serum creatinine level was 120 µmol/L. The referral letter mentioned a low serum complement C3 level. With reference to the latter information, which of the following comments are relevant to her disease?  A history of infective endocarditis is of relevance. A detailed medical history and physical examination to search for infection focus. Diagnosis of myeloma should be suspected. Hepatitis B and C serology should be sought. Laboratory testing should include anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody. ",1 and 4,2 only,3 and 4,All except 3,All of above,D,"This is a case of hypocomplementaemia glomerular disease. Differential diagnosis should include:  Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (classically infective endocarditis) Lupus nephritis Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis Mixed cryoglobulinaemia  Her proteinuria points to glomerular pathology. Glomerular diseases with low complement levels narrow down the differential diagnosis. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is classically associated with decreased serum C3 (and a normal C4, indicating activation of the alternative pathway of complement). This indicates one form of chronic immune complex disease (see above for the common examples). On the other hand, lupus nephritis is associated with activation of the classical pathway and often associated with suppression of both C3 and C4. This is considered a correct answer although the question did not mention the C4 level. The median age at diagnosis of multiple myeloma is 70 years, much older than this case. Renal impairment is unrelated to immune complex; it occurs mostly as a result of direct tubular damage from excess protein load, dehydration, hypercalcaemia, and the use of nephrotoxic medications."

The findings including normal blood pressure, normal creatinine and haematuria without proteinuria point towards a benign prognosis and for this reason he only requires regular monitoring rather than intervention with immunosuppressive agents. Treatment with corticosteroids is usually reserved for those patients with hypertension and a rising creatinine. Where there is significant hypertension +/- proteinuria, then ACE inhibitors are the first choice antihypertensive agent. Post-streptococcus glomerulonephritis usually occurs one to three weeks after initial infection."

urinary system,475,"A 49-year-old smoker who had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus two years ago was hospitalised because of a foot ulcer. Below knee amputation was performed because of necrotising fasciitis. Pre-operatively, his serum creatinine measured 78 µmol/L. After recovery from the operation, a repeat creatinine showed a level of 54 µmol/L. What is the most likely explanation for the decrease in serum creatinine level?",The kidney function did not improve but creatinine generation reduced after amputation,The kidney improved with resolved inflammation,The nephrologist started dialysis,This is compatible with daily variation of creatinine level,None of the above,A,"The use of serum creatinine to estimate the glomerular filtration rate can be misleading when the patient has abnormal muscle mass (such as leg amputation). We assume an improvement of kidney function when there is a falling creatinine level; this statement holds true only in the absence of a large change in muscle mass (or meat intake). The generation of creatinine is primarily determined by dietary intake and muscle mass, which probably accounts for the apparent 'improvement' in the creatinine level after an amputation. Dialysis cannot be chosen as an explanation for the decrease in serum creatinine level in this instance because the question mentioned no clear indication for dialysis."

Where would you expect the associated sensory loss?,Anterior thigh ,Dorsum of foot,Perineum,Posterior calf,Sole of foot,B,The features suggest an L5 radiculopathy which would be associated with a loss of sensation in the dorsum of the foot and big toe.
urinary system,479,A 67-year-old smoker presents to the haematuria clinic with a two week history of frank haematuria. He has no previous urological history. He is a lifelong smoker. Examination is unremarkable. USS of his pelvis demonstrates a filling defect on the wall of the bladder. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Bladder adenocarcinoma,Bladder diverticulum,Bladder stone,Bladder squamous cell carcinoma,Bladder transitional cell carcinoma,E,The filling defect on the bladder wall in conjunction with haematuria is suggestive of a bladder tumour of which the most common is transitional cell carcinoma. Bladder diverticula do not usually cause haematuria. Bladder stones usually present with a mobile defect in the bladder.
urinary system,480,Which of the following is correct regarding vasectomy?,Has a long term failure rate of less than 0.1%,Involves ligation and division of the spermatic cord,Is associated with a small increased risk of prostate cancer,Is occasionally complicated by a hydrocele,Lowers testosterone levels,A,"Male sterilisation by vasectomy is a safe, simple outpatient procedure. It can usually be performed under local anaesthetic. There are many different techniques of vasectomy. Separate, small (3-4 mm) incisions allow the vas to be separated from its blood vessels. A centimetre of it is excised. The ends are tied with absorbable ligatures and separated. The ends may also be folded and tied, cauterised with bipolar diathermy and tissue interposed between the ends. A no-scalpel method, developed in China, is gaining popularity. Complications are:  Bleeding (1-2%) Wound infection/epididymo-orchitis (1-2%) Granuloma formation (2%) Chronic pain, occasionally severe (1-3%).  It is essential to check the operation has been successful and no early reconnection has taken place. Most surgeons require two consecutive sperm-free semen samples before the patient is told it is safe to discontinue alternative contraception methods. These are usually taken 10-12 weeks after the operation to give time to clear sperm remaining above the site of ligation. Once the samples are clear the late reconnection rate is less than 1 in 1000. There is no effect on hormone levels. There is no evidence of an increased risk of prostate or testicular cancer."
urinary system,481,"A 58-year-old man presents with central back pain which shoots down to his left foot. There is paraesthesia over the lateral aspect of the left foot, impaired ankle jerk and weakness of plantarflexion. His right leg is normal. What is the most likely cause of his pain?",Cauda equina syndrome,Cervical disc prolapse,L3/4 disc prolapse,L4/5 disc prolapse,L5/S1 disc prolapse,E,"L5/S1 is correct as it is the S1 nerve root that is involved. The L5/S1 disc can compress the S1 nerve root causing:  sciatic pain loss of plantarflexion impaired S1 reflex (ankle jerk), and paraesthesia over the lateral aspect of the foot.  Cauda equina syndrome is incorrect as there would be bilateral signs and bladder involvement. Cervical disc prolapse is incorrect as signs would be bilateral and involve paraplegia. L3/4 and L4/5 are incorrect as they involve the wrong spinal root."
urinary system,482,Which one of the following is an oncogenic virus?,Hepatitis A,Human papilloma virus 6 (HPV 6),Human papilloma virus 11 (HPV 11),Human papilloma virus 16 (HPV 16),Varicella zoster virus (VZV),D,"HPV 16 is oncogenic and causes squamous cell carcinomas in the oral cavity, cervix, anus and penis. Hepatitis A is not an oncogenic virus, as it does not cause chronic infection or cancer. HPV 6 and 11 typically cause the majority of benign warts. VZV causes chicken pox and herpes zoster. The HPV vaccine Gardasil protects against 9 HPV viruses. "
urinary system,483,Which one of the following cytokines is strongly implicated in renal scarring?,Interferon alpha,Interleukin-10,Granulocyte colony stimulating factor,Transforming growth factor-beta,Tumour necrosis factor alpha,D,"Renal scarring is a serious complication of chronic pyelonephritis that occurs due to vesicoureteric reflux. It is mediated by cytokines, chemokines and their receptors, complement, adhesion molecules and extracellular matrix proteins. The cytokines which seem to play the largest role are interleukin (IL)-1beta, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and IL-3. TGF-beta in particular seems to be pro-fibrotric by recruiting fibroblasts, and a genotype where its production is limited has been shown to be less likely to develop renal scarring. Interferon-alpha is produced by leucocytes, and is mainly involved in innate immune responses against viral infection. It is also made synthetically as medication, used for the treatment of hepatitis C, for example. Interleukin-10 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine which acts to inhibit the synthesis of other cytokines. It also enhances B-cell survival, proliferation and antibody production. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is produced by a number of different tissues to stimulate the bone marrow to produce granulocytes, and release them into the blood. It also stimulates the survival, proliferation, differentiation and function of neutrophil precursors and mature neutrophils. It is used therapeutically in patients with neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy, particularly in cases of neutropenic sepsis. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is one of the cytokines that can stimulate the acute phase reaction. The majority is produced by activated macrophages, and it acts to regulate immune cells, induce fever and sepsis, initiate cell apoptosis and inhibit tumourgenesis and viral replication. "
urinary system,484,Which vertebral level and corresponding structure is correct?,C4 and bifurcation of the carotid artery,T2 and manubriosternal joint,T8 and aortic opening in the diaphragm,T10 and opening for vena cava in diaphragm,T12 and oesophageal opening in the diaphragm,A,"The carotid artery bifurcates at C4. The manubriosternsal joint (angle of Louis) lies at the level of the T4/5 intervertebral disk. The aortic opening is at T12. The caval opening in the diaphragm lies at T8. The oesoghageal opening of the diaphragm lies at T10.   Remember things going through diaphragm with Voice Of America - Vena cava T8, Oesophagus T10, Aorta T12."
urinary system,485,A patient is admitted with decompensated liver disease and tense ascites. His bloods reveal an acute renal failure. He is not on any nephrotoxic drugs. He had been previously on spironolactone and furosemide for prophylaxis of ascites however these were stopped some months ago. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and his renal failure does not respond to fluids. A urinalysis shows a trace amount of protein but nil else. An ultrasound of the renal tract shows no evidence of obstruction. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hepatorenal syndrome,Sepsis,Glomerulonephritis,Hypovolaemia,Previous furosemide use,A,This patient has renal failure in the absence of hypovolaemia or nephrotoxics and in the presence of decompensated liver disease and ascites which makes hepatorenal syndrome the most likely diagnosis. There is no evidence of obstruction on the ultrasound and if glomerulonephritis were the cause then haematuria and significant proteinuria would be found. HRS is thought to be due to the combination of renal vasoconstriction secondary to activations of RAA and sympathetic nervous systems and alteration in renal prostaglandins. Other causes must be excluded before this is presumed to be the diagnosis. Terlipressin and albumin therapy should be utilised along with ensuring adequate hydration and avoiding nephrotoxics. TIPS and liver transplantation are other therapies utilised.
urinary system,486,A 32-year-old woman has severe right sided abdominal pain radiating into the groin which has lasted for 3 hours. She is writhering in pain. She has no abdominal signs. What is the most likely cause of her abdominal pain?,Appendicitis,Ruptured ectopic pregnancy,Salpingitis,Ureteric colic,Strangulated hernia,D,Abdominal pain radiating to groin indicates stone at lower ureter. [i) Pain from upper ureteral stones tends to radiate to the flank and lumbar areas. ii) Midureteral calculi cause pain that radiates anteriorly and caudally. This midureteral pain in particular can easily mimic appendicitis on the right or acute diverticulitis on the left. iii) Distal ureteral stones cause pain that tends to radiate into the groin or testicle in the male or labia majora in the female
urinary system,487,Which of the following diuretics acts as a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor?,Acetazolamide,Bumetanide,Furosemide,Metolazone,Spironolactone,A,"Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and has a weak diuretic activity. Furosemide is wrong as it acts on the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and prevents active water reabsorption in the kidney by blocking the sodium, potassium, chloride cotransport channel. Bumetanide has a similar action. Metolazone blocks sodium reabsorption in the distal convoluted channel. Spironolactone is an aldosterone receptor antagonist at the cortical collecting duct."
urinary system,488,"In acute renal failure secondary to tumour lysis syndrome, which of the following is not a typical finding?",Hyperkalaemia,Hyperphosphataemia,Hypercalcaemia,Hypocalcaemia,Hyperuricaemia,C,"Tumour lysis syndrome is secondary to rapid breakdown of tumour cell (typically haematological malignancies) which leads to hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia and acute renal failure. If risk of tumour lysis syndrome is high then IV hydration and hypouricaemic agents such as allopurinol or newer rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) should be utilised. Urinary alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate has also been used."
urinary system,489,"A 36-year-old police officer presents with a three day history of slurred speech. She also complains of double vision and a sensation of breathlessness. The oxygen saturations are 99% on air. Neurological examination reveals normal power, reflexes and plantar responses. Which of the following would improve symptoms in this presentation to aid the diagnosis?",G-CSF,Edrophonium,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,Physiotherapy,Plasmapheresis,B,This lady has symptoms suggesting myasthenia gravis. Her breathlessness is probably secondary to anxiety about the symptoms and associated hyperventilation. Edrophonium (Tensilon) is sometimes used in the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and would be expected temporarily to improve symtpoms.

Her only abnormal results were a haemoglobin was 9.8g/dl, a creatinine of 810 micromol/l and a calcium of 2.08 mmol/l. What has caused her cardiac arrest?",Stroke,Hyperkalaemia,Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic Non-Ketotic Coma,Coronary artery disease,Hypocalcaemia,D,Dialysis greatly increases a patients risk of coronary artery disease and with a background of hypertension then this risk is compounded.
urinary system,491,"A 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes and renal failure comes to the Emergency Department. He currently uses continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, nd has noticed an increase in his insulin requirements over the past 24 hours, dull abdominal pain, and now has a cloudy bag. On examination he is pyrexial 37.8°C and looks unwell, his blood pressure is 142/88 mmHg, with a pulse of 90. His abdomen is generally tender to palpation.

Which of the following statements concerning the genetics of the condition is correct?,His brothers will all be affected,His daughters' sons will have a 50% chance of having the disease,His daughters will have a 50% chance of being carriers,His sons' children will have a 50% chance of having the disease,His sons will be carriers of the condition,B,"Becker's muscular dystrophy is an X linked condition and so 50% of males will be affected in a family. His sons will get the X chromosome from their mother and so will not be carriers, but all of his daughters will be carriers. However, his daughters' sons will consequently have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease as all of his daughters are carriers and there is a 1 in 2 chance (50:50) of passing the gene on to their sons. On the other hand his sons who are not affected do not pass on the condition."

She has been doing bladder training under the guidance of the incontinence nurses for 12 months but hasn't seen a significant improvement. She feels too she is too old and weak to have surgery. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?,Oxybutynin,Propantheline,Mirabegron,Darifenacin,Imipramine,D,This is a classic trick question and may well come up in the exam. Most people know Oxybutynin is 1st line treatment for overactive bladder. Yet it shouldn't be given to frail elderly patients . Urinary Incontinence It is useful to classify patients into stress incontinence (SI) or overactive bladder (OAB). For SI lifestyle measures including weight loss if BMI over 30 and fluid management are key. If these fail a plethora of invasive procedures may be considered by MDT. The initial treatment of OAB is summarised below.

urinary system,495,"A 60-year-old male presents with a six month history of a gradually increasing burning sensation in his feet. Examination revealed normal cranial nerves and higher mental function. There was also normal bulk, tone, power, light touch and pinprick sensation, co-ordination and reflexes in upper and lower limbs With which of the following are the clinical findings are consistent?",Diabetic amyotrophy,Large fibre sensory neuropathy,Motor neurone disease,Sjögren's syndrome,Small fibre sensory neuropathy,E,The burning sensation described is typical of a neuropathy affecting the small unmyelinated and thinly myelinated nerve fibres. General neurological examination and reflexes are usually normal in this type of neuropathy unless there is coexisting large (myelinated) fibre involvement. Neuropathy affecting the large myelinated sensory fibres generally causes glove and stocking sensory loss and loss of reflexes. Conditions in which the small fibres are preferentially affected in the early stages include diabetes and amyloidosis. In the later stages however the neuropathy in these conditions also affects large fibres. The neuropathy associated with Sjögren's syndrome is a pure sensory neuropathy (ganglionopathy).
urinary system,496,"A 10-year-old boy presents with generalized swelling. This has been present for 4 days and included swollen ankles and puffiness of the face. It started a few days after he had a mild cold with runny nose. His only PMH (past medical history) was eczema. Urine analysis: hematuria, proteinuria 10 g/24 hours, creatinine 60µmol/l and albumin=15 g/l. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",IgA nephropathy,HSP,Minimal change nephropathy,Wilson’s disease,Cardiac failure,A,"10 yr old boy, history of URTI and hematuria points towards the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy. It may be present with proteinuria and generalized swelling. The important differentiating point from rapidly progressive GN is duration.

urinary system,497,A 30-year-old gentleman with a history of heavy alcohol intake presents with macroscopic haematuria. He reports having an upper respiratory tract infection in the last two days. His renal function continues to decline and he is evaluated in the renal unit. His serum C^3 is normal. What is a biopsy of his kidneys most likely to show?,C4d staining positive,Effacement of podocytes on electron microscopy,Humps in the subepitheilal space on electron microscopy,IgA deposition in the mesangium,Tram track pattern on light microscopy,D,The history of alcohol excess and macroscopic haematuria soon after an upper respiratory tract infection should point the candidate towards IgA nephropathy. This is further confirmed by the normal C^3 level. C4d staining positive is incorrect as this refers to the detection of BK virus by the C4d stain. Podocyte effacement is incorrect as this is diagnostic of minimal change disease. The hump-like appearance in subepithelial space is characteristic of post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. The tram track appearance on light microscopy represents membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis and therefore should not be selected.
urinary system,498,"An 81-year-old female is admitted following a seizure although her relatives state that prior to this she had been increasingly confused, unsteady and unable to look after herself over the last two to three weeks. On examination she was drowsy and had a temperature of 37.5°C, and a blood pressure of 192/108 mmHg. She had a mixed aphasia, with a mild right hemiparesis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cerebral infarction,Acute intracerebral haemorrhage,Cerebral abscess,Chronic subdural haematoma,Glioblastoma ,D,"The history of progressive 'confusion' and unsteadiness for some weeks followed by an acute exacerbation is a typical presentation of a subdural haematoma in the elderly population. Cerebral abscess is unlikely due to the absence of significant fever. The onset may be sudden or subacute over several weeks, but headache is usually a dominant feature as are focal neurological deficits. Acute infarction or acute intracerebral haemorrhage would not explain the two week history of confusion and unsteadiness. Glioblastoma usually causes symptoms over months, and are less common than intracranial haemorrhages in patients in this age group. Mixed aphasia (or transcortical mixed aphasia) is not a complete 'global aphasia'. In global aphasia there is receptive and expressive dysphasia. With mixed aphasia, patients can often repeat words but not understand commands, name objects or have intelligible spontaneous speech. 'Mixed aphasia' is not specific for stroke, although it can be caused by it. It may be caused by the following:  Alzheimer's disease Bilateral cerebral damage Tumours, and Thalamic lesions.  "
urinary system,499,Which of the following is correct with regard to hyperuricaemia?,Can be reduced with low dose aspirin therapy,Can be treated with uricosuric drugs even in renal failure,In primary gout is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner,Is most commonly due to an excess purine consumption,Occurs in association with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,E,"Hyperuricaemia may be due to increased purine intake, urate production or reduced urate clearance, and is most commonly due to the latter. Therefore it can occur in association with enhanced cell destruction, particularly leukaemias. Primary gout has no obvious mode of inheritance, but familial juvenile gouty nephropathy is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder. Low dose aspirin may exacerbate gout but high dose aspirin is uricosuric. Many of the uricosuric drugs may be detrimental in renal failure and may not be effective."

The patient's friends tell you that prior to the seizure she had become confused and her behaviour had been out of character. On examination the patient is post-ictal, with a fever of 39.1°C. She has a pulse of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 130/71 mmHg. A CT head shows no abnormalities. CSF examination shows no organisms, with a white cell count of 200/mm^3 (less than5) mostly lymphocytes with a protein concentration of 2.3 g/L (0.29-1.98) and glucose of 3.2 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). What is the likely diagnosis?",Epilepsy,Herpes simplex encephalitis,Meningococcal meningitis,Pneumococcal meningitis,Viral meningitis,B,"Herpes simplex encephalitis presents with:  Behavioural changes or psychiatric disturbance Focal seizures Fever and Alteration in consciousness.  The key differentiating feature is the presence or absence of altered cognition or consciousness. Seizures can occur in both meningitis and encephalitis and a diagnosis of encephalitis should not be based on the presence of seizures alone. It has peaks of presentation in the young and old. A computerised tomography (CT) scan of the brain may be normal, but a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal the diagnosis. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) usually shows lymphocytosis with raised protein, sometimes elevated red cells and a normal or low glucose. In the acute setting, it may show neutrophilia but a repeat CSF stufy several hours later will show a shift towards lymphocytosis. A high index of suspicion should give you the diagnosis, and if in doubt, intravenous aciclovir will protect the patient whilst other avenues are being explored. "
urinary system,503,A 16-year-old girl presented with Henoch-Schönlein purpura and renal involvement. What is the most likely outcome?,A high probability of relapse,Complete renal recovery,Persistent hypertension,Persistent proteinuria,Requirement for long-term corticosteroids,B,"Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a self-limiting vasculitis which occurs in children and young adults. It is characterised by:  non-thrombocytopenic purpura arthralgia abdominal pain, and glomerular nephritis.  It is likely to be an immune complex disease - involving IgA, but no treatment has proven efficacy. The disease usually settles between four to six weeks without sequelae if kidney involvement is mild. However, this condition can occasionally relapse."
urinary system,504,"A 65-year-old man presents with four months history of swallowing difficulties (worse with liquids than solids). He also complains of nasal regurgitation, coughing and choking episodes during meals and slight dysarthria. He lost one stone over the last eight weeks. Which of the following investigations is the most appropriate for this case?",Acetyl choline receptors antibodies,Barium swallow,CXR,Gastroscopy,Tumour markers,A,"Nasal regurgitation, coughing and choking episodes during meals, dysphagia that is worse with liquids than solids and dysarthria indicate neurogenic dysphagia. Important causes at this age include myasthenia gravis and motor neuron disease. Lambert Eaton syndrome very rarely affects the bulbar muscles. Myasthenia gravis is an antibody-mediated disorder which reduces the efficiency of signal transduction across the neuromuscular junction. There is resultant weakness of the innervated muscle, which increases with fatigue. The commonest associated auto-antibodies are against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The majority of patients are affected by ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, dysarthria and dysphasia. Treatment is with cholinesterase inhibitors, and immunosuppression in severe cases. Mechanical dysphagia (for example, oesophageal and gastric carcinoma, oesophageal stricture, etc) causes dysphagia that is worse with solids than liquids. Nasal regurgitation and dysarthria are not usually accompanying features of mechanical dysphagia. No abnormality would be expected on chest x ray, barium swallow or gastroscopy with myasthenia gravis, and tumour markers are not raised.  A number of you suggest achalasia could be the diagnosis in this case. However, achalasia typically affects solids more than liquids, or solids and liquids equally (rather than the opposite as in this case). It typically presents earlier than this (25 to 40-years-old). Chest pain is a predominant feature, and this level of weight loss is unusual."
urinary system,505,Which of the following is the recommended amount of sodium that should be given per day for a 70 kg adult male on maintenance intravenous fluids?,30 mmol,70 mmol,120 mmol,160 mmol,180 mmol,B,"Understanding sodium requirements is important especially when maintenance intravenous fluid prescriptions are required. Daily maintenance requirements vary between individuals and the clinical situation, but according to the most recent NICE guidelines for a 70 kg male the amounts prescribed for patients on maintenance fluids are:  25-30 ml/kg/day of water and  approximately 1 mmol/kg/day of potassium, sodium and chloride and   approximately 50-100 g/day of glucose to limit starvation ketosis.

urinary system,506,"A 60-year-old man presents to nephrology clinic with fatigue. He has a history of stage four chronic kidney disease, secondary to hypertension. A full blood count reveals a normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin concentration of 97 g/L. White cell count and platelets are within normal limits. You are considering commencing treatment for his anaemia. What is the most appropriate investigation to help guide treatment?",Peripheral blood film,Serum erythropoietin,Serum ferritin,Serum lactate dehydrogenase,Urinary 24 hour creatinine clearance,C,"Renal-related anaemia can start to develop at this stage as an alteration in erythropoietin production occurs. It is worsened by reduced dietary intake of iron due to anorexia, impaired intestinal absorption of iron, toxic effect of uraemia on erythroid precursors and reduced red blood cell survival. It is imperative that renal patients avoid repeated blood transfusion, unless in extremis, so that future renal transplantation will not be precluded by allo-sensitisation. Before initiation of recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents the patient should be iron replete. The serum ferritin and transferrin saturation should be checked, as most patients will be iron deficient. Targets for treatment are:  haemoglobin 105-125 g/L ferritin greater than100 μg/L in pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, greater than200 μg/L in haemodialysis patients, and transferrin saturation greater than20%  Measurement of serum erythropoietin adds no benefit when diagnosing and managing anaemia in chronic kidney disease due to the unreliability of the test. With a normal white cell and platelet count, a peripheral blood film is not indicated as an initial investigation. Serum lactate dehydrogenase is not indicated as there is no indication of haemolysis from the history. Urinary 24 hour creatinine clearance may be useful in the assessment of renal disease but will not aid further evaluation of anaemia in this case."

Which one of the following treatments is she likely to have been given?,Botulinum toxin,Dantrolene,Intrathecal baclofen,Oral baclofen,Tizanidine,A,"Botulinum toxin is the treatment of choice for focal dystonia (such as torticollis, and hemi-facial spasm) and focal dystonia. The primary action of the toxin is to block acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction and so to produce muscle weakness. Occasionally systemic absorption of the toxin can affect distal muscles causing symptoms such as diplopia and dysphagia."

Her blood pressure is 140/82 and she has classical rheumatoid features on her hands. Her urine is positive for blood and protein, her haemoglobin is 11 and creatinine levels are slightly raised. What investigation should be performed next?",Cystoscopy,CT KUB,Urine culture,Renal biopsy,Renal ultrasound,D,Sulphasalazine has been known to cause glomerulonephritis and this has happened in this case. If the patient presented with only blood in her urine then cystoscopy would be indicated to look for a bladder tumour. Protein only would suggest amyloidosis and also require a biopsy.

This leads to a secondary increase in parathyroid hormone levels. The second, fourth and fifth options will cause hypercalcaemia. Hypoparathyroidism is a possibility, but given you are told in the question stem that he has chronic renal failure, it is more likely that he has secondary hyperparathyroidism. Standard therapy of choice is three times per week 1-alpha calcidol. Once the calcium approaches the normal range there is often an associated fall in parathyroid levels. Cinacalcet may be used in patients with end-stage renal disease receiving maintenance haemodialysis, with frequent monitoring of parathormone and calcium."
urinary system,510,"A 60-year-old Asian man who has lived in the United Kingdom for the past 15 years presents with painless haematuria. He is a smoker of 10 cigarettes per day. Investigations reveal a haemoglobin of 110 g/L (120-160), urinalysis shows ++ blood and PA chest x ray shows small flecks of white opacifications in the upper lobe of the left lung. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bladder carcinoma,Glomerular disease,Prostatic carcinoma,Renal calculi,Tuberculosis,A,"The most likely diagnosis in this middle-aged male is carcinoma of the bladder as suggested by haematuria and anaemia. The history of smoking is a risk factor for bladder cancer. The gentleman does not have any of the features of active TB such as fever, night sweats or weight loss, which we would expect if he had renal TB. The opacifications in the lung are consistent with previous primary TB. Having said that, renal TB can present without systemic symptoms but bladder cancer is more common."
urinary system,511,"A 60-year-old man presents with mobility problems. On examination he has Lhermitte's phenomenon, is Romberg's positive, and has a wide-based gait that deteriorates on eye closure, absent ankle jerks and extensor plantars. He takes thyroxine for an underactive thyroid but has no other medical problems. He is concerned as he had an uncle who developed unsteadiness and ended up in a wheelchair. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Cervical spondylosis,Friedreich's ataxia,Multiple sclerosis,Subacute combined degeneration of the cord,Under-replacement of thyroxine,D,"Subacute combined degeneration of the cord is secondary to B12 deficiency. B12 deficiency is usually caused by pernicious anaemia, this may be associated with other autoimmune conditions. Lhermitte's phenomenon is typically present in multiple sclerosis, but may also occur in sub-acute combined degeneration of the cord. This man's gait disturbance and positive Romberg's sign point towards dorsal column damage. Causes of absent ankle jerks and extensor plantars include:  B12 deficiency HIV Spinal AVM Taboparesis Friedreich's ataxia Cervical and lumbar spondylosis  The family history is a red herring. His uncle may well have had Friedreich's ataxia, however, this usually presents by the age of 30. Cervical spondylosis can cause Lhermitte's phenomenon. However, only if both cervical and lumbar spondylosis are present can spondylosis cause absent ankle jerks and extensor plantars. Friedreich's ataxia may be associated with absent ankle jerks and extensor plantars but, as mentioned above, this usually presents by age 30. Multiple sclerosis can cause Lhermitte's phenomenon and extensor plantars but could not account for the lower motor neurone signs. Under-replacement of thyroxine is incorrect; although hypothyroidism can cause ataxia this would not account for the other symptoms."
urinary system,512,Depression after traumatic brain injury is most commonly seen after damage to which part of the brain?,Amygdala,Left prefrontal cortex,Left temporal lobe,Right prefrontal cortex,Right temporal lobe,B,"Major depression following traumatic brain injury has been associated with reduced gray matter volume in the lateral left prefrontal cortex. Temporal lobe damage typically causes problems with memory and is the most epileptogenic lobe of the brain. The amygdala is involved in emotional processing particularly fear. increased activation rather than damage to the amygdala is associated with depression, and army veterans who suffered damage to this area have in fact been shown to suffer less PTSD and depressive symptoms. Bilateral damage to the amygdala can result in Kluver-Bucy syndrome - hyperphagia, hypersexuality, hyperorality, and docility."
urinary system,513,An 81-year-old man was admitted with renal failure due to benign prostatic hypertrophy. His bladder was drained with an urethral catheter followed by a diuresis of more than 3L per day. After two days he became progressively drowsy. What is the most likely cause for his reduced level of consciousness?,Hyperglycaemia,Hypocalcaemia,Hypomagnesaemia,Hyponatraemia,Metabolic acidosis,D,"Amelioration of urinary obstruction and subsequent recovery initially results in a large electrolyte and water loss. Osmotic cerebral changes precipitated by urinary sodium loss, the major intravascular cation, is the cause of drowsiness. Hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia may occur as tubular reabsorption is suboptimal in the early stages of recovery, but is unlikely to affect conscious level. Acid-base status should improve after relief of the obstruction. Hyperglycaemia is not a common complication of recovery from obstructive uropathy."
urinary system,514,A 50 year old woman presents with a 3 month history of a vaginal lump. This has been affecting her day to day activities and also causes dyspareunia. She has no bladder or bowel symptoms. She had a total abdominal hysterectomy with ovarian preservation at the age of 42 for fibroids. She has no other significant past medical or surgical history. Her general and abdominal examination was unremarkable. Vaginal examination findings are shown below. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Insertion of a Gellhorn pessary,Colpocleisis,Supervised pelvic floor exercises,Sacrocolpopexy,Sacroscpinous ligament fixation,D,"Vaginal vault appears to be at least 2 cm below the introitus. As this patient is fit and sexually active, surgery would be the best option. Colpocliesis will obliterate the vagina whereas sacrospinous ligament fixation is associated with significant dyspareunia and best avoided in women who are sexually active. Hence, the best option is sacrocolpopexy"
urinary system,515,"A 15-year-old boy presents with generalized edema. His urinalysis reveals protein +++, eGFR 110.

urinary system,516,"A 70-year-old man presents with difficulty speaking. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination the patient is awake; his blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg. His pulse is irregularly irregular. He has 4/5 strength on the right arm and leg and 5/5 strength on the left. When asked to point to the window he does this correctly. When told to raise his arms and place his hands out he is seen to have a pronator drift on the right. He is shown a pen and asked what it is. He is unable to identify it by name and appears frustrated, applying much effort to speak a sentence. He is asked to use it appropriately and begins to write on a piece of paper but no makes no legible words despite being a retired journalist. When asked to repeat 'Today is a sunny day', he is able to do so. With what type of dysphasia is this consistent?",Broca's aphasia,Global aphasia,Transcortical motor aphasia,Transcortical sensory aphasia,Wernicke's aphasia,C,"An injury to the anterior superior frontal lobe results in good comprehension but poor verbal output with the exception of echolalia or repetition. Writing is usually also impaired. Repetition is also spared as the arcuate fasciculus is not involved. In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In Wernicke's or fluent or receptive aphasia the patient is able to form correct grammatical sentences but language content is incorrect. It localises to the dominant superior temporal gyrus. There is poor comprehension and repetition but verbal output is fluent. Transcortical sensory aphasia is similar to transcortical motor aphasia in that there is good repetition but comprehension and fluency are poor. Global aphasia results in an almost mute patient: there is poor verbal output, comprehension, repetition and understanding."
urinary system,517,"You are auditing the nephrology department's rates of peritoneal dialysis peritonitis, observing the proportion of cases that are culture positive and the associated organism. In the United Kingdom, what is the most common causative organism in peritoneal dialysis peritonitis?",Coagulase negative Staphylococcus,Enterococcus spp.,Escherichia coli,Pseudomonas spp.,Staphylococcus aureus,A,"Around 10-30% of cases are culture negative. At 20-25% overall, coagulase negative Staphylococcus is the most commonly cultured organism. With improved hygiene and technique, rates of staphylococcal infection are falling. Intra-abdominal pathology (such as a ruptured viscus) should be considered if more than one organism is grown, especially if Gram-negative or anaerobic. Repeated treatment increases the risk of resistant organisms. This may require loss of catheter and switch to haemodialysis. Coagulase negative Staphylococcus is the most commonly cultured organism in peritoneal dialysis peritonitis. It represents 20-25% of cases. It is a skin commensal that opportunistically causes infection through the catheter site. Enterococcus represents 1-5% of cases and occurs less frequently than coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Escherichia coli is less common. Overall, Gram-negative organisms represent 10-15% of cases. Pseudomonas represents 5% of cases and occurs less frequently than coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. Staphylococcus aureus represents 10-15% of cases and occurs less frequently than coagulase-negative Staphylococcus."
urinary system,518,"A 37 year old male has a history of rhinorrhoea , recurrent sinusitis, joints pains and cough with occasional haemoptysis. On dipstick of his urine there is evidence of proteinuria and haematuria. Bloods reveal acute renal failure and autoantibodies reveal a positive cANCA. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Wegeners Granulomatosis,Churg Strauss syndrome,Haemolytic Uraemic syndrome,Microscopic polyangitis,IgA nephropathy,A,"The most likely diagnosis is Wegeners granulomatosis. This is a small vessel vasculitis and effects multiple organs. There is necrotising granuloma formation. The history of rhinorrhoea, sinusitis, haemoptysis and cough and haemoptysis are suggestive of this. CANCA is often found. In the kidneys most often leads to a segmental pauci immune crescentic necrotising glomerulonephritis. Churg Strauss there is rhinitis, asthma and eosinophilia unlike in Wegeners granulomatosis. In microscopic polyangitis the upper respiratory tract is spare. HUS leads to anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure and often follows bloody diarrhoea such as E. Coli."
urinary system,519,Which area whose sensation is supplied by the median nerve will be spared if the nerve is compressed at the carpal tunnel?,Skin over the hypothenar eminence,Skin over the lateral three digits,Skin over the medial two digits,Skin over the thenar eminence,Skin over the volar surface of the hand,D,"The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve lies superficial to the flexor retinaculum and does not pass through the carpal tunnel. It supplies the skin over the thenar eminence, which is therefore spared in carpal tunnel syndrome.  The hypothenar eminence is supplied by the ulnar nerve as are the volar surface and the medial two digits (the fourth and fifth digits, remember the dermatomal map has palms facing outwards). The lateral three digits are supplied by the median nerve but are affected by carpal tunnel syndrome."
urinary system,520,"A 54-year-old man attends the surgery. He has a history of myocardial infarction and is taking simvastatin for secondary prevention. However, his brother recently experienced rhabdomyolysis and he is now concerned about the risk of rhabdomyolysis due to his simvastatin. Which statin is associated with the lowest risk of rhabdomyolysis?",Atorvastatin,Cerivastatin,Fluvastatin,Lovastatin,Simvastatin,C,"Statins are generally very safe medications but confer a small risk of rhabdomyolysis. Data are conflicting about the likely incidence of rhabdomyolysis in statin users, but certain statins appear to have a lower incidence than others. Statins and their associated risk of rhabdomyolysis:    Atorvastatin 0.04%   Cerivastatin 3.16%   Fluvastatin less than0.04%   Pravastatin 0.04%   Lovastatin 0.19%   Simvastatin 0.12%    The lipophilic statins, simvastatin, lovastatin and cerivastatin are all associated with a higher incidence of rhabdomyolysis compared to hydrophilic statins. It is possible that the lipophilic statins have a greater ability to cross the myocyte cell membrane and cause direct effects on intracellular organelles. Cerivastatin has been withdrawn from the market as the risk of rhabdomyolysis was considered unacceptably high. "
urinary system,521,"A 46-year-old man was seen for an insurance medical examination. He was entirely asymptomatic, but his serum urate concentration was noted to be 0.5 mmol/L (0.23-0.46). What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",Allopurinol ,Colchicine ,Ibuprofen ,Lifestyle intervention,Sulphinpyrazone,D,"Uric acid is the major product of the catabolism of purines, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP) from nucleic acids. GMP and AMP are catabolised by a series of enzymes which remove a single phosphate group and the ribose sugar, eventually forming xanthine. Xanthine is then converted to uric acid by the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Uric acid can then be excreted by the kidneys. When uric acid levels are high, there is a risk of developing gout, which causes monoarticular inflammation, gouty arthropathy and tophaceous deformity. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are used in the treatment of gout, to reduce the amount of uric acid formed. The patient above requires lifestyle advice about reducing intake of substances containing high purines (including some alcohol and red meat). Should he become symptomatic, treatment would be advisable. In acute gout, treatment is with NSAIDs or other anti-inflammatories such as colchicine. A xanthine oxidase inhibitor such as allopurinol should be started after the acute attack to reduce the risk of recurrence. Causes of hyperuricaemia include: Increased formation of uric acid: Primary:  Idiopathic and inherited metabolic disease  Secondary:  Alcohol Psoriasis Increased nucleic acid turnover: leukaemia and myeloma Tissue hypoxia Excess dietary purine intake.  Decreased excretion of uric acid: Primary:  Idiopathic  Secondary:  Acute or chronic renal disease Organic acidosis: lactate, ketones Lead poisoning Drugs: aspirin and thiazides Down's syndrome."
urinary system,522,"In idiopathic hypercalciuria, what management should be initiated if there is renal stone disease or bone demineralization?",Cranberry juice,Dietary modification and thiazide diuretics,Increased fluid intake,Lithotripsy alone,Dietary modification,B,In idiopathic hypercalciuria there is excess calcium excretion. Initially dietary modification with a reduction in calcium intake can be commenced (however this must be carefully done in childhood) however if there is evidence of renal stones or bone demineralisation then thiazide diuretics which increase calcium reabsorption and reduce calcium excretion.
urinary system,523,Which of the following is the best description of the drug cinacalcet?,Binding phosphate in the gut lumen,Calcimimetic,Increasing absorption of calcium from the gut,Preventing ADH action at the distal collecting duct,Preventing osteoclast action,B,"Cinacalcet is a calcimimetic, acting on the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland. It has a particular use in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure. Mimicking negative feedback on the parathyroid gland results in the reduction of parathyroid hormone secretion from the parathyroid gland.  Binding phosphate in the gut lumen is incorrect; this represents the action of phosphate binders. Increasing absorption of calcium from the gut is incorrect as it represents the action of vitamin D. Cinacalcet does not have an action of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and so preventing ADH action at the distal collecting duct is incorrect. Neither does it affect osteoclasts directly; preventing osteoclast action is wrong as this represents the action of bisphosphonates."
urinary system,524,A 48-year-old teacher came to the nephrology clinic; he was found to have stage 3 chronic kidney disease during a health check. He wished to discuss future renal replacement therapy. Which of the following is/are considered to be contraindication/s to peritoneal dialysis?  Presence of colostomy Heparin allergy Hepatitis B infection History of complex abdominal surgery with adhesion ,1 and 4,"1, 3 and 4",4 only,All of the above,None of the above,A,"Peritoneal dialysis makes use of a closed system (peritoneal cavity) to allow effective dialysis. Colostomies are thought to increase the risk of peritonitis with peritoneal dialysis. The decision to use PD in patients with a colostomy or ileostomy is based on individuals, but they are thought to be relative contraindications and haemodialysis is often felt to be more appropriate.  Complex abdominal surgery and resultant extensive adhesion damage the peritoneal membrane (peritoneal fibrosis) and lead to compartments within the peritoneum. This is now considered a relative contraindication to peritoneal dialysis. Heparin anticoagulation, in contrast to extracorporeal haemodialysis therapy, is not needed for peritoneal dialysis. Simple abdominal surgery, however, does not preclude peritoneal dialysis; examples include cholecystectomy, appendectomy or caesarian section."

Investigations revealed:    Serum creatinine 180 umol/L (60-100)   Urinalysis Protein++    Renal ultrasound revealed a right kidney of 7 cms and a left kidney of 10 cms (normal dimensions 10-14 cm). Which investigation should be requested to establish the diagnosis?,Cystoscopy,Intravenous urography,Isotope renography,Renal arteriography,Renal biopsy,D,"This patient has renovascular disease with a right renal artery stenosis. The gold standard for establishing the diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is renal arteriography and this is commonly performed with magnetic resonance angiography. In one-third of cases, the disease is bilateral; 40% may have peripheral vascular disease and there may be proteinuria."

He is treated with analgesia and sent home with follow-up by the urology team. He manages to pass a stone in his urine and this is sent for analysis. What is the most common composition of renal stones in the general population?,Calcium oxalate,Calcium phosphate,Cystine,Magnesium ammonium phosphate,Uric acid,A,"Calcium oxalate stones are the most frequent, followed by calcium phosphate. Together these make up a significant majority of stones. Cystine stones are rare and associated with tubular defects. This answer should not be selected. Magnesium ammonium phosphate stones are associated with urea splitting organisms and are not common. Uric acid stones make up about 5-10% of stones and are less common than calcium based stones. "

His speech is slurred and he has difficulty swallowing fluids. On examination of his limbs he has normal tone in all limbs and no deficits of power. Reflexes are normal, however there is sensory loss with diminished pain and temperature down the left side. Which artery has infarcted?",Left posterior cerebral,Left posterior inferior cerebellar,Right basilar,Right posterior cerebral,Right posterior inferior cerebellar,E,"This is lateral medullary syndrome, accounted for by infarction of the ipsilateral posterior inferior cerebellar artery. The cerebellum, IX and X nuclei, and descending sympathetic tracts (giving a Horner's) are affected on the same side. The spinothalamic tract is also affected, this decussates, therefore giving contralateral long tract loss of pain and temperature. The dorsal columns are relatively spared. The trigeminal nerve may also be affected, producing ipsilateral facial sensory abnormalities."

Demyelinating diseases include Multiple Sclerosis with many genomic mutations increasing ones risk of devlopement such as mutation in TYK2. Myopathic diseases include muscular dystrophies. Neuro-oncologic diseases include conditions such as acoustic neuromas.  Peripheral neuropathies can be caused by a number of problems such as drugs, vitamin or mineral deficiencies or primary neuological conditions."
urinary system,530,"A 15-year-old boy presents with acute left testicular pain. He is not sexually active. On examination the scrotum appears normal but he has a tender, swollen left testis. The right testis appears normal. Urine dip is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute epididymitis,Mumps orchitis,Ruptured epididymal cyst,Testicular neoplasm,Testicular torsion,E,"The features of acute testicular pain suggest testicular torsion and should prompt surgical referral. This is a clinical diagnosis. There may only be a few hours before irreversible ischaemia occurs. Investigations, such as ultrasound, may be unhelpful, unavailable or cause delay. When in doubt explore (and fix the other side too if it is a torsion). It is better to explore and be wrong than the other way round. Torsion: acute pain and swelling of testis, with absent cremasteric reflex. Epididimitis: acute pain and swelling. Rare before puberty, and commoner in sexually active."

urinary system,533,Which of the following is least likely to cause choreiform movements?,Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN),Rheumatic fever,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Thyrotoxicosis,Untreated Parkinson's disease,E,"Chorea is a form of dystonia, which results in involuntary, irregular, flowing movements ('dance-like'). It has multiple causes which can be primary or secondary. The underlying pathology is generally poorly understood but likely involves an imbalance in the basal ganglia pathways. Causes of chorea are numerous but include inherited causes such as Huntington's chorea and Wilson's disease. Acquired causes include:  Drugs - antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, amphetamines, dopamine agonists in patients with Parkinson's disease Toxins - carbon monoxide, cyanide, opiates, mercury Immune - post-streptococcal (Syndenham's chorea), SLE, vasculitis (PAN, Behcet's disease) Infectious - meningitis, encephalitis, cerebral toxoplasmosis, new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Vascular - stroke, polycythaemia, moyamoya Hormonal - hypoparathyroidism, pregnancy, OCP, HRT, hyperthyroidism Metabolic - hyper/hyponatraemia, hypo/hyperglycaemia, hypomagnesaemia, hypocalcaemia, B1 and B12 deficiency Paraneoplastic - small cell lung carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, lymphoma CNS - trauma, tumours, senile chorea.  As noted above, treatment for Parkinson's disease can result in chorea but it would be unusual to get it in a patient who has not been on treatment. Bradykinesia and paucity of movement is expected in such patients. "

urinary system,537,A patient with type 2 diabetes mellitus requires a CT angiography with contrast. His bloods reveal a normal renal function. Which of the following is required to try to prevent the development of contrast nephropathy?,IV sodium bicarbonate and IV NaCl,Adequate hydration with IV dextrose,Nil required,IV sodium bicarbonate,Adequate hydration with IV 0.9% NaCl,E,In patient with diabetes the risk of developing contrast nephropathy despite no evidence of renal disease may be as high as 14%. The best way to prevent contrast nephropathy is through adequate hydration and this is often with the use of 0.9% NaCl. IV sodium bicarbonate is advocated by some if the risk is high however at present there is no clear evidence this is beneficial although two small studies have shown that IV sodium bicarbonate in addition to normal saline is better than normal saline alone.
urinary system,538,"A 40-year-old civil servant attends the clinic stating that she has difficulty swallowing. She gives a two month history of difficulty with solids which has progressed to difficulty tolerating liquids in the previous two weeks. She has noticed some weakness in her right arm which has affected her ability to lift certain objects like the kettle. Previously, she has enjoyed good health with no hearing loss or facial weakness. She describes no visual symptoms. On examination, she has an absent gag reflex on the right, with reduced palatal movements. There is weakness on rotating the head to the left with flattening and weakness of elevation of the right shoulder. Eye movements, visual acuity, hearing and tongue movements are all normal. Where is the likely site of the lesion?",Left cerebello-pontine angle,Left jugular foramen,Right cerebello-pontine angle,Right jugular foramen,Right pons,D,"The clinical scenario is that of a right sided pathology affecting the IX, X and XI cranial nerves. This produces the palatal weakness and the swallowing difficulties (IX/X), while the shoulder and sternocleidomastoid weakness are due to accessory nerve (XI) involvement. The absence of hearing loss or facial weakness makes a cerebello-pontine angle lesion unlikely. A lesion outside the skull may also involve the XII nerve (tongue). The most likely site, therefore is the jugular foramen."
urinary system,539,An 86-year-old lady is admitted with parkinsonism. Exposure to which of the following drugs is the most likely cause?,Buprenorphine,Cyclizine,Metoclopramide,Phenytoin,Trimethoprim,C,"Metoclopramide is a dopamine receptor antagonist that can induce parkinsonism. It can also worsen control in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease to its antagonistic effect on dopamine receptors. Buprenorphine is an opioid agonist and does not cause parkinsonism. It is very rare for cyclizine to induce parkinsonism. Cyclizine is a histamine receptor antagonist. There have been only two case reports of phenytoin-induced parkinsonism that resolved after discontinuation of phenytoin. Trimethoprim does not cause extrapyramidal side effects. Of the options given, metoclopramide is far more likely to cause extrapyramidal side effects. "
urinary system,540,A mother comes to your office concerned about her 2-year-old son. She has noticed that he typically laughs inappropriately for no particular reason. Shortly after an event he appears to be fidgeting. These events last only minutes and in between the events he acts normally. You suspect gelastic seizures. From where do these typically arise?,Brainstem,Frontal lobes,Hypothalamus,Pineal gland,Temporal lobe,C,Gelastic seizures are typically the result of a hypothalamic hamartoma. Gelastic seizures should be suspected in cases of erratic laughing or crying. It can be hard to identify in young children but there is usually associated automatisms such as fidgeting or lip smacking or change in sensorium. Automatisms can be seen in temporal lobe seizures. Frontal lobe involvement in neurodegenerative disease can cause emotional lability. The pineal gland is involved in melatonin release. If this were brainstem you would expect to see cranial nerve involvement which is not mentioned in the case.

On closer examination there may also be repetition problems and comprehension problems but these are typically mild compared to other aphasia syndromes. In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. An injury to the anterior superior frontal lobe results in transcortical motor aphasia with good comprehension but poor verbal output with the exception of echolalia or repetition. Writing is usually also impaired. Repetition is also spared as the arcuate fasciculus is not involved. Conduction aphasia has poor repetition and naming but intact comprehension and fluent verbal output. It is different to the transcortical sensory and motor aphasias in that there is intact comprehension and fluency which are not seen in each of the transcortical aphasias respectively.
urinary system,545,A patient is found to be in acute renal failure with a potassium of 6.8mmol/L.  Her ECG shows tall tented T waves.  She is commenced on cardiac monitoring and is given insulin dextrose infusion and salbutamol nebulisers.  Which other treatment should be given?,Further insulin dextrose,Calcium Gluconate,Repeat Potassium,Calcium resonium,Sodium bicarbonate,B,"In hyperkalaemia of over 6.5 mmol/L and with associated ECG changes then 10% calcium gluconate should be given.  This is cardioprotective although does not lower the potassium.  Insulin dextrose and salbutamol nebulisers should be utilised for the treatment of hyperkalaemia as both drive potassium into cells.  Calcium resonium is not useful in the acute setting.  Sodium bicarbonate would be to correct metabolic acidosis and therefore improve hyperkalaemia however this should only be used by specialists.  Depending on he cause of renal failure, this should be treated e.g. if pre renal then IV fluids.  Dialysis may be required ultimately."
urinary system,546,"A 62-year-old man seeks an opinion about a tremor which mostly affects his right hand but also latterly his left hand and which has gradually deteriorated over five years. His medical history includes asthma for which he takes inhaled salbutamol, hypertension for which he takes bendroflumethiazide and lisinopril and depression for which he takes amitriptyline. He smokes 10 cigarettes daily and drinks approximately 15 units of alcohol weekly, noting an improvement in his tremor following alcohol. Examination reveals some mild titubation and a postural tremor in both arms with no worsening during finger-nose testing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benign essential tremor,Hyperthyroidism,Parkinson's disease,Physiological tremor,Salbutamol-induced tremor,A,"The features of relief with alcohol, postural tremor and a slight and rather benign deterioration over five years suggests a diagnosis of benign essential tremor. Physiological tremor usually affects the hands only. In this case there is titubation, again a feature of essential tremor. The mild features argue against Parkinson's disease. The condition is typically slowly progressive and occurs from approximately 50 years. Hyperthyroidism presents with a resting tremor and taccycardia plus anxiety. The deterioration in the history would not keep with physcological or salbutamol induced tremor.  Parkinson's classically presents with a pill rolling tremor at rest and rigidity without postural tremor."
urinary system,547,"A patient is undergoing dialysis when he suddenly develops headache, nausea, blurred vision and becomes disorientated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disequilibrium syndrome,Hypovolaemia,Hypokalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypertensive encephalopathy,A,This patient has developed dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. It is caused by cerebral oedema which is thought to be caused by a reverse osmotic shift induced by urea and a fall in cerebral intracellular pH.
urinary system,548,Which one of the following is a recognised risk factor for the development of renal calculi?,Escherichia coli infection,Hyperoxaluria,Pseudohypoparathyroidism,Streptococcus infection,Rickets,B,"Pre-disposing causes of renal calculi include:  Urinary tract infection (especially Proteus) Structural urinary tract abnormalities Metabolic problems Idiopathic hypercalciuria Hyperuricosuria Hyperoxaluria, and Hypercystinuria.  Infected stones tend to be composed of magnesium ammonium phosphate (struvite) and calcium phosphate. Renal stones related to infection are most commonly associated with urea-splitting bacteria (urease): Proteus, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas. Staphlococcus aureus. Nephrocalcinosis can be a complication of furosemide therapy in the neonate. Presentation is usually with haematuria, loin or abdominal pain, urinary tract infection or passage of a stone."
urinary system,549,"A man presents with scrotal swelling, the swelling is cystic and is non-tender. It is located in the upper pole of the posterior part of the testis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Epididymal cyst,Testicular ca,Hydrocele,Teratoma,Testicular torsion,A,the location of upper pole of the posterior part of testis is the common site for epididymal pathology
urinary system,550,"A 16-year-old boy presents with periorbital and peripheral oedema which has developed over the past few weeks. He had a previous episode some two years earlier but this responded over the course of a few weeks to a course of prednisolone. On examination he has a BP of 141/80 mmHg, with pulse of 68. His chest is clear but he has bilateral pitting oedema. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 129 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 6.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 209 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (60-120)   Albumin 24 g/L (30-50)   Urine Protein ++    Which of the following represents the most appropriate management plan for him?",Oral combination corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide,Oral corticosteroids,Oral cyclophosphamide,Oral methotrexate,Renal biopsy,B,"The age of this patient and his previous response to corticosteroids is suggestive of an underlying diagnosis of minimal change nephropathy. As such, a further course of corticosteroids is the treatment of choice. Given the inherent but low risks associated with renal biopsy, it is usually only attempted when three or more episodes of oedema have occurred. Very few patients with minimal change disease actually progress to end stage renal disease, and only around 10% of children with the disease suffer from hypertension."
urinary system,551,A 65-year-old with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a heavy smoking history is started on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) for high blood pressure. His creatinine subsequently doubles from 100 µmol/L to 200 µmol/L. His general practitioner is concerned about the possibility of renal artery stenosis. Which of the following investigations would give the highest diagnostic yield for this condition?,CT abdomen,CT abdomen with contrast,Duplex ultrasonography,Magnetic resonance angiogram (MRA),Plasma renin levels,D,"Renal artery stenosis is an important cause of hypertension to recognise. A rise in creatinine of 15% from baseline is expected with the commencement of an ACE-inhibitor. In this vignette, the large rise in creatinine should warrant a search for renal artery stenosis given the likelihood of vascular disease. Of the investigations listed, CT abdomen and CT abdomen with contrast should not be selected as CT imaging should be directed towards the aorta and not the abdomen (CT angiogram). In addition, the contrast could cause nephrotoxicity in the context of recent acute kidney injury. Plasma renin levels can be measured but lack specificity. Duplex ultrasonography is a common first line investigation but may not be diagnostic due to technical difficulties (obese patients, overlying bowel gas). This leaves MRA as the top choice for investigating renal artery stenosis. "
urinary system,552,A 60-year-old man presents with severe colicky pain from his right flank radiating to his groin. His urinalysis reveals trace blood cells. What is the single most discrimatory investigation?,US abdomen,XR KUB,Colonoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,Laproscopy,A,Features are of ureteric colic. X-ray KUB may miss radiolucent stones so US abdomen is the discriminatory investigation

Which of the following is true of prostate cancer?,"Incidence is approximately 50 per 100,000 of the population",Is commoner in Asian than Caucasian men,Is commoner in Caucasian men than Afro-Caribbeans,Is the most common cause of cancer death,Risk increases from the age of 40 for those with a first degree relative with the condition,E,"Prostatic carcinoma is commonest cause of cancer in males but due to effective treatment is the second commonest cause of death from cancers next to lung malignancy. Risk increases from the age of 50 for those without a family history but from 40 for those with a first degree relative with the condition and Afro-Caribbeans where risk is greatest. Asians have the least risk. About 10% have a family history and the incidence is between 10-20 per 100,000."
urinary system,554,A 39-year-old man with acute renal failure presents with palpitations. His ECG shows tall tented T waves and wide QRS complex. What is the next best step?,Dialysis,IV calcium chloride,IV insulin w/ dextrose,Calcium resonium,Nebulized salbutamol,B,"The ECG changes are suggestive of Hyperkalemia. At potassium level of >5.5 mEq/L occurs tall tented T waves and at potassium level >7 mEq/L occurs wide QRS complex with bizarre QRS morphology. Though patient needs dialysis, “NEXT” best treatment is calcium chloride as it will stabilize the heart from potassium induced arrhythmias while we prepare the patient for dialysis"
urinary system,555,"A patient presents with haematuria, loin pain and on examination there is evidence of an abdominal mass on the left side. A CT reveals several masses in the left kidney but no evidence of any distant metastases. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the treatment of choice?",Tumour embolisation,Radiotherapy and/ or chemotherapy,Surgical removal with or without radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy,Interleukin 2 or interferon alpha,Sunitinib,C,This patient presents with the classic triad of renal cell carcinoma. The treatment of choice as long as the patient is fit for surgery is nephrectomy (or partial nephrectomy where the disease is localised) with or without radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. Even in some metastatic disease where the patient is fit sometimes nephrectomy is still considered with use of interferon alpha. Sunitinib can be used first line in those with advanced metastatic disease. Tumour embolisation can be utilised in those with problematic haematuria who are not fit for surgery.
urinary system,556,A 50-year-old man presents with the complaints of recurrent UTI (urinary tract infection) and occasional blood in the urine. Some unusual cells have been seen in urine on routine examination. Which of the following investigation would you like to carry out now?,Cystoscopy,Urine C&S,XR KUB,US,CBC,A,Likely diagnosis is bladder cancer. Occasional blood in urine and unusual cells (suggestive of malignant cells) suggests the diagnosis. It is also true that in bladder cancer there occurs frequent UTI like symptoms
urinary system,557,"A 28 year old female presents to her GP with joint pain , fever, a butterfly rash and fatigue. She has marked peripheral oedema. She is found to be hypertensive, in acute renal failure, low albumin levels and proteinuria. A renal biopsy is performed and reveals focal glomerulonephritis with subendothelial and mesangial immune deposits. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lupus nephritis class I,IgA nephropathy,Lupus nephritis Class III,Membranous glomeurlonephritis,Lupus nephritis class II,C,"This patient presents with features of SLE.   Lupus nephritis can lead to hypertension, proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and renal failure.  There is immune complex deposition and complement activation and can lead to various findings on renal biopsy. In class I there is minimal change with some mesangial immune deposits and mild proteinuria. In Class II there is mesangial hypercellularity and mesangial immune deposits and presents with mild renal disease. In class III there is focal lupus nephritis with renal biopsy findings as described. There is normally active SLE and moderate proteinuria."
urinary system,558,"A 75-year-old lady with metastatic lung small cell cancer is admitted with confusion, lethargy and hyponatraemia. The admitting clinicians think that her presentation is compatible with a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Which of the following medications is the appropriate treatment for this?",Demeclocycline,Furosemide,Intranasal desmopressin,Intravenous 5% dextrose,Spironolactone,A,"SIADH is the excess production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) resulting in increased water retention at the distal tubules. Among many causes, small cell cancer is associated with ADH secretion. Demeclocycline will block the action of ADH on the distal tubules, thereby preventing water reabsorption. Furosemide and spironolactone are diuretics and likely to lower serum sodium. Intranasal desmopressin is equivalent to ADH and will worsen the situation, further lowering serum sodium. Rehydration with 5% dextrose is likely to lower serum sodium more, so this should be avoided."
urinary system,559,"A 30-year-old man presents to hospital complaining that his urine has been very dark recently, resembling coffee at worst. He has been under the weather 2 weeks back and had taken a few days off work with a sore throat and coryzal symptoms. Urine dipstick in hospital returns highly positive for blood and protein. He is admitted for supportive management and is scheduled for a renal biopsy, which shows mesangial proliferation with a positive immune-flurescence pattern. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Membranous glomerulonephropathy,SLE,Wegener’s granulomatosis,Post – strep GN,IgA nephropathy,D,"Nephritic picture, H/O sorethroat 2 weeks before presentation and biopsy reports are suggestive of post streptococcal glomerulonephritis"
urinary system,560,"A 35-year-old woman has noticed increased clumsiness and tremor. She has recently broken up with her partner because he found her increasingly argumentative. She has no past medical history and takes no prescribed or recreational drugs. There is a family history of liver cirrhosis in her grandfather, who drank four bottles of whisky per week. She reports drinking less than four units per week. What is the likely cause for her tremor?",Alcohol abuse,Huntington's disease,Lewy body dementia,Multiple sclerosis,Wilson's disease,E,"Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition which causes build up of copper in the body. Copper accumulates in the liver and brain. This results in hepatitis, liver failure or cirrhosis. Accumulation in the brain can result in behavioural changes, depression, seizures, parkinsonism, however the initial sign is usually increased clumsiness. This woman's tremor, clumsiness and behavioural change could be put down to alcohol abuse. Given the family history of cirrhosis it would be important to rule out Wilson's disease before accusing her of alcohol problems. Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative genetic disorder that is autosomal dominant. The features are of choreiform movements, problems with coordination and walking, behavioural and psychiatric problems. The disease leads eventually to dementia and premature death. Lewy body dementia is a mixture of Alzheimer's disease with Parkinson's disease. The main features are fluctuating cognition and alertness from hour to hour, visual hallucinations (usually of animal or human, and the patient may have insight into these hallucinations) and motor features of Parkinson's disease. Multiple sclerosis would present in this age group and sex. It is due to autoimmune mediated demyelination. To make the diagnosis there must be two separate attacks separated in time and space (that is, affecting two different nerves and on two separate occasions). The commonest signs and symptoms are  Optic neuritis Sensory loss Spinal cord symptoms with spasticity Autonomic dysfunction of bladder and bowel Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and depression."
urinary system,561,A 73-year-old man presents with an abrupt onset of double vision and left leg weakness. Examination shows right sided facial weakness affecting upper and lower parts of the face. He also has a left hemiparesis. Which of the following is the site of the lesion?,Left frontal lobe,Left lateral medulla,Right corpus striatum,Right midbrain,Right pons,E,"The combination of diplopia, hemiparesis, and a lower motor neurone facial nerve lesion should lead you to consider a pontine stroke. The lateral pontine syndrome classically consists of:  Contralateral loss of pain and temperature sensation in the trunk and extremities - lateral spinothalamic tract Ipsilateral paralysis of the upper and lower face (lower motor neurone lesion), ipsilateral loss of lacrimation and reduced salivation, ipsilateral loss of taste from the anterior two thirds of the tongue, loss of the corneal reflex (efferent limb) - facial nucleus and nerve (VII) Ipsilateral loss of pain and temperature sensation of the face - spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract Nystagmus, nausea, vomiting, vertigo - vestibular nuclei Ipsilateral central deafness - cochlear nuclei Ipsilateral limb and gait apraxia - middle and inferior cerebellar peduncle Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome - descending sympathetic tract."

Churg-Strauss is a small and medium sized artery vasculitis. p-ANCA is positive in 70% of patients. High dose steroids with the addition of cyclophosphamide or azathioprine are standard therapy for the condition. With treatment, the one-year survival rate for Churg-Strauss is 90%; 62% at five years."
urinary system,563,"A 70-year-old man presents with weight loss, lower limb weakness and dry mouth. He has been a heavy smoker. On examination he looks cachectic; he has proximal lower limb weakness, areflexia (reflexes normalise with repetitive muscle contraction). There is no wasting or fasciculations. Sensory examination is normal. Which of the following blood tests is the most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",Acetylcholine receptors,Anti GM1 antibody,Antinuclear antibody,Anti Ro/La antibodies,Voltage gated calcium channels antibodies,E,"The most likely diagnosis is Lambert-Eaton syndrome. It results when IgG autoantibodies blockade the voltage-gated calcium channels of peripheral cholinergic nerve territory. Fifty per cent of the cases are associated with small cell lung carcinoma. Proximal lower limb weakness is the most consistent neurological feature. Ptosis and ophthalmoplegia are rare. Autonomic dysfunction is common (for example, dry mouth). The reflexes are depressed or absent but normalise with repetitive muscle contraction."
urinary system,564,"A patient with renal failure has serum K+ 7.5, raised creatinine and broad complex tachycardia. What is the most appropriate management?",Calcium gluconate,Sodium bicarbonate,Dialysis,Furosemide,Sotalol,A,Calcium gluconate don’t shift K+ to cell or reduce potassium level but it prevents arrythmogenic action of raised K+ till definitive measure is taken
urinary system,565,"A 35-year-old woman presents with pains in her back. On examination she has wasting and weakness of the intrinsic muscles of the right hand, absent tendon reflexes in the right arm and impaired pinprick and temperature sensation in the right hand and forearm. These symptoms have been getting progressively worse and she has noticed her back is slightlymore curved. She has suffered no physical trauma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Combined median and ulnar nerve lesions,Lower trunk brachial plexus lesion,Neuralgic amyotrophy,Syringomyelia,Thoracic outlet syndrome,D,"Median and ulnar nerve lesions would not cause absent reflexes in the arm. Lower trunk brachial plexus (C8/T1) would not cause absent reflexes in the arm. Neuralgic amyotrophy affects the upper plexus (C5-6) and therefore does not cause wasting of small muscles of hand. Thoracic outlet syndrome will not cause absent reflexes. Syringomyelia typically causes loss of reflexes, spinothalamic sensory loss, and weakness. It can be asymmetrical initially."
urinary system,566,Which of the following is a recognised cause of a phrenic nerve palsy?,Aortic aneurysm,Dermoid,Ganglioneuroma,Pericardial cyst,Sarcoidosis,A,"The diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic nerve (C3,4,5).

The most recent study by Bax et al showed no difference in outcomes between those patients managed with medical therapy versus stenting. Other studies suggest that complications of stenting or angioplasty outweigh any benefits versus medical therapy. There is no evidence to support re-introducing ACE inhibition or substituting an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) with respect to potential outcomes. As such, in the first instance, response to increased medical therapy for blood pressure should be assessed. "

She is commenced on anti-retrovirals. At a follow-up appointment four weeks later she has routine blood tests, of which her creatinine is shown below. She is euvolaemic and has not taken any additional medications over the counter. On presentation her results showed:    Serum creatinine 80 µmol/l (60 - 90)    and four weeks later:    Serum creatinine 220 µmol/l (60 - 90)    Which of the following answers is most likely to be responsible for her acute renal impairment?",Efavirenz,HIV associated nephropathy,Lamivudine,Non-compliance with medications,Tenofovir,E,"This question requires knowledge of the side effects of anti-retroviral medications. Tenofovir is associated with acute and chronic renal impairment and of the answers given is the most likely cause of the acute renal impairment. Non-compliance with medications should not be selected as there is no reason why this would specifically affect renal function. This would be assessed with repeat viral loads and CD4 counts to which we do not have access. HIV associated nephropathy is incorrect given the speed of deterioration in renal function. Of the anti-retroviral medications, tenofovir is associated with acute renal dysfunction more than efavirenz and lamivudine."
urinary system,572,A 47-year-old man comes to the GP with a swelling in his left groin which disappears on lying down. The swelling was bluish in color and felt like a bag of worms. He also complains of a mass in the left loin along with hematuria occasionally. What could be the possible diagnosis?,Left sided RCC,Varicosity 2nd to liver disease,Testicular tumor,UTI,IVC obstruction,A,"Most common secondary cause of left sided varicocele is RCC. Newly diagnosed varicocele over the age of 40yrs are very much suggestive of RCC. Varicocele is common on left side as left testicular veins drain to the left renal vein, while the right testicular vein drain directly into IVC"
urinary system,573,Which of the following investigations best supports a diagnosis of new variant CJD?,CSF analysis,CT brain ,EMG ,MRI brain ,VEPs ,D,MRI brain typically shows bilateral posterior thalamic high signal abnormalities in a patient with new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis only shows non-specific changes. EMG and CT brain are normal. Sporadic CJD (and not new variant CJD) is associated with specific EEG changes.
urinary system,574,"A 56-year-old gentleman established on peritoneal dialysis presents with abdominal pain, fever and cloudy drainage. A diagnosis of peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis is suspected. Which of the following laboratory findings is most useful in establishing the diagnosis of PD peritonitis?",Doubling in serum C reactive protein (CRP),Doubling in serum creatinine,Neutrophils consisting 10% of total white cell count (WCC) in PD fluid,Raised serum amylase,White cell count greater than 100/mm^3 in PD fluid sample,E,"PD peritonitis is an important complication of peritoneal dialysis. The vignette describes a typical presentation. A high suspicion for the diagnosis is required and empirical treatment is often started. PD fluid WCC of greater than 100/mm^3 is diagnostic of PD peritonitis and should be selected. Raised serum CRP may be associated but is not necessarily diagnostic. Likewise, doubling of serum creatinine may have multiple reasons and should not be selected. Although amylase may be raised there can be other intra-abdominal causes. A PD fluid neutrophil percentage of greater than 50% and not 10% is in keeping with PD peritonitis."
urinary system,575,A 60-year old man with a history of non-small cell lung cancer was treated with a right lower lobectomy 12 months ago.

urinary system,577,A young boy presented to the OPD 12 weeks after renal transplantation with fever and pain in lower abdomen. Renal functions were deranged. Renal biopsy showed immune cell infiltrate and tubular damage. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Pyelonephritis,Chronic graft rejection,Acute rejection,Drug toxicity,Graft vs host disease,C,"Acute rejection usually occurs in the first few months after transplant, but may occur up to a year after transplant. Rise of creatinine, fever, graft pain these may be seen in acute graft rejection. Biopsy showing immune cell infiltrate and tubular damage are suggestive of acute graft rejection"
urinary system,578,"A 42-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of systemic sclerosis is referred to hospital with a complaint of headaches and blurred vision. She has a medical history of asthma. On examination, her blood pressure is 230/120 mmHg and there is bilateral papilloedema. Which of the following medications should be prescribed immediately?",IV furosemide,IV labetolol,IV sodium nitroprusside,Oral enalapril,Sublingual nimodipine,D,"Systemic sclerosis is a systemic disorder characterised by skin thickening due to the deposition of collagen in the dermis. Adverse prognostic features are renal, cardiac or pulmonary involvement. A major complication is the development of scleroderma renal crisis. This is characterised by the abrupt onset of severe hypertension, usually with retinopathy, together with rapid deterioration of renal function and heart failure. In addition, patients may present with headaches, fever and malaise. It develops in 5-10% of patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis especially associated with diffuse cutaneous or rapidly progressive forms of systemic sclerosis, and patients in whom a high dose of corticosteroid has been started. Renal crisis is linked with a positive ANA speckled pattern, anti-RNA polymerase I and II antibodies and absence of anti-centromere antibodies^1. It usually presents early, within four years of diagnosis. The pathogenic mechanisms leading to renal damage are not completely understood but they involve endothelial cell damage and intimal thickening of the renal arteries, resulting in hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus and increased renin release^1. Renal biopsy is not necessary for patients presenting with classical features of renal crisis^2. The clinical presentation is typically with the symptoms of malignant hypertension:  Headaches Hypertensive retinopathy associated with visual disturbances Seizures Heart failure and pulmonary oedema.  Renal function is impaired and usually rapidly deteriorates. The hypertension is almost always severe with a diastolic BP over 100 mmHg in 90% of patients. There is hypertensive retinopathy in about 85% of patients with exudates and haemorrhages and if severe, papilloedema There may also be microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and raised renin levels. Scleroderma renal crisis is a medical emergency. Aggressive treatment is required to prevent the occurrence of irreversible vascular injury. First line treatment is a gradual reduction in blood pressure (10-15 mmHg per day) with an ACE inhibitor until the diastolic pressure reaches 85-90 mmHg. This approach leads to a response in 90% of patients by reversing the angiotensin-II mediated vasoconstriction. An abrupt fall in blood pressure should be avoided as it can further diminish renal perfusion and increase the risk of acute tubular necrosis. Therefore, parenteral antihypertensive agents (for example, intravenous nitroprusside or labetolol) should be avoided. Calcium channel blockers, usually nifedipine, may be added where there is inadequate reduction of blood pressure with ACE inhibitors alone. .Additional oral hypotensive agents (for example, labetolol) can be used if required, and if pulmonary oedema is present a nitrate infusion may be indicated. There is anecdotal evidence that intravenous prostacyclin helps the microvascular lesion without precipitating hypotension, and this is used in some UK centres. Deterioration in renal function can be rapid, with gross pulmonary oedema; therefore patients with scleroderma renal crisis should be managed in hospitals with facilities for dialysis. Early aggressive treatment with ACE inhibitors has improved prognosis in renal crisis, although 40% of patients will require dialysis and mortality at five years is 30-40%^1. Median time to recovery is one year, and typically occurs within three years^1. Prognosis is worse for males^1. Patients who need dialysis for more than two years can be considered for renal transplantation^2. The recurrence rate has been estimated to be approximately 20%. Care should be taken not to confuse scleroderma renal crisis with malignant hypertension. Malignant hypertension is a clinical syndrome characterised by marked elevation of blood pressure, with widespread acute arteriolar injury^4. It has a number of different causes and treatment differs depending on the underlying condition. The pathogenesis overlaps, but idiopathic malignant hypertension tends to involve the smaller vessels than in scleroderma renal crisis. "
urinary system,579,An 18-year-old man presented with a history of a sudden onset of a frontal headache and photophobia. He had neck stiffness and a temperature of 38°C. Which one of the following findings would suggest a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage rather than bacterial meningitis?,A blood neutrophil leucocytosis,A family history of polycystic kidney disease,A fluctuating conscious level,A history of diabetes mellitus,A history of opiate abuse,B,"Fluctuating level of consciousness can occur in both meningitis and subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Hypertension is a risk factor for SAH, but not diabetes. Opiate abuse does not increase the risk for SAH. Cerebral aneurysms are associated with polycystic kidney disease."
urinary system,580,Which of the following is true regarding vasectomy?,Can be successfully reversed in up to 75% of cases,Does not inhibit spermatozoa production in the postoperative period,Is associated with a higher short-term morbidity rate than female sterilisation,Reversals result in pregnancy occurring in approximately 10% of cases at three years,Usually takes up to six weeks to become effective,B,"There is short term morbidity of infection and discomfort associated with vasectomy. The vast majority of procedures can be undertaken under local anaesthesia as a day case. Reversal is practical. Up to 90% will achieve motile sperm in the ejaculate within one year. The achievement of pregnancy is lower but still excellent, with figures quoting up to 70% success rate if reversal is within three years of the vasectomy. The pregnancy rate decreases with increasing time since the vasectomy, down to around 25% after ten years."
urinary system,581,"An 18-year-old presents with her third 'funny turn'. She was witnessed smacking her lips and making repetitive chewing movements. She recalls a rising epigastric sensation preceding this, but was unaware of what she was doing. Which of the following would you suspect?",Absence seizures,Frontal lobe epilepsy,Migraine,Temporal lobe epilepsy,Transient ischaemic attack,D,This is a classic description of temporal lobe epilepsy. It can present with gastric rising and repetitive mouth movements. The commonest finding is hippocampal sclerosis and an MRI is an appropriate investigation. Spread of the seizure activity to the contralateral temporal lobe impairs memory of the event in the complex partial form of temporal lobe epilepsy. Absence seizures is incorrect as there are repetitive movements involved. Frontal lobe epilepsy is incorrect as it does not tend to involve repetitive mouth movements or gastric rising. Migraine is incorrect as there is no headache and there is memory loss. Transient ischaemic attack is incorrect as there is not a sudden onset of focal neurology.
urinary system,582,"A 75 year old woman presents with a 6 month history of recurrent urinary tract infections. She also reported urinary urgency and frequency approximately ten times during the day and nocturia three to four times. She has also noticed blood stained urine on and off. She had no fever and has been generally well. She has no significant past medical or surgical history and otherwise fit and well. She has no allergies. Her general, abdominal examination showed slight suprapubic tenderness and vaginal examination showed atropic external genitalia with a first degree cystocele. The cervix was health and the uterus was small and no adnexal masses felt. Her urine analysis showed: + leucocytes, + protein, no nitrites, +++ RBC. What is the most appropriate next management step?",Bladder retraining,Renal tract ultrasound,Treatment with tolterodine 4 mg nocte,Treatment with trimethoprim 100 mg nocte for 6 months,Treatment with topical estrogen for 6 months,B,"Women over the age of 60 years with overactive bladder symptoms, recurrent UTIs and microscopic haematuria may have underlying pathology such as bladder cancer or calculi. Hence a renal tract ultrasound scan and a cystoscopy is essential to exclude these before commencing treatment in this situation."
urinary system,583,"A 14-year-old boy is referred by the practice nurse for follow-up with you. He was brought by his mother to see the practice nurse because of progressive hearing loss. Examination and basic investigations revealed nothing of note, apart from haematuria detected on routine urine testing. Apparently, he has an 18-year-old brother who also suffers from deafness and has mild renal impairment. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 7.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 199 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (60-120)   ESR 8 (less than10)   Urine Blood +    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alport's syndrome,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,IgA nephropathy,Membranous nephropathy,Minimal change disease,A,"Alport's syndrome comprises:  Sensorineural hearing loss Progressive renal failure Haematuria Ocular abnormalities including cataract formation.  The condition is often associated with an X-linked dominant inheritance pattern and hence males are more severely affected. Prevalence is around 1 in 5000, and the condition occurs because of type 4 collagen mutations. Deafness usually occurs before the onset of renal failure, which is related itself to progressive nephritis. Rigorous control of hypertension may delay the onset of end-stage renal failure, which is seen in 90% of patients with Alport's by the age of 40 years."
urinary system,584,Which of the following is a known risk factor for the development of chronic rejection of kidney transplantation?,Age,Anti-smooth muscle antibodies,Presence of anti-HLA antibodies,Smoking,Toxoplasma infection,C,"Chronic rejection is characterised by fibrosis of normal organ structures. The pathogenesis of chronic rejection is not clear; some prefer the term andquot;chronic allograft dysfunctionandquot; since both immunological (antigen-dependent and antigen-independent) and non-immunological factors have been identified. Cell-mediated and humoral immune mechanisms have been implicated in this form of graft rejection. It has also been suggested that rejection is a response to chronic ischaemia caused by injury to endothelial cells. Proliferation of intimal smooth muscle is observed leading to vascular occlusion. The fact that chronic rejection is rare in transplants between HLA-identical siblings suggests that HLA-antigen dependent immunological factors are important. Risk factors include:  number of previous acute rejection episodes presence of anti-HLA antibodies anti-endothelial antibodies CMV infection dyslipidaemia hypertension functional mass of the donor kidney, and delayed graft function (a clinical manifestation of ischaemia/reperfusion injury)."
urinary system,585,"A 28-year-old man presented with hypertension. On examination, he had palpable kidneys and abdominal ultrasound shows bilaterally enlarged cystic kidneys. Which one of the following conditions is most likely to be present in this patient?",Mitral stenosis,Nail dystrophy,Polycythaemia,Short stature,Testicular atrophy,C,"The most likely diagnosis here is adult polycystic kidney disease, which is associated with valvular heart abnormalities, incompetence and aneurysms of the cerebral circulation. It is also associated with excessive erythropoietin production and polycythaemia. Mitral valve prolapse occurs in 25%, and there is an increased incidence of aortic incompetence. Hepatic cysts are seen in 70%. These can also involve the pancreas (10%) and spleen. Cerebral berry aneurysms are present in 5-8%, but there tends to be familial clustering - i.e. if there is a family history greater than20% of patients will also have an aneurysm. Diverticular disease is thought to be increased in patients with polycystic kidney disease."
urinary system,586,A patient presents with acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. Which other biochemical abnormalities may be seen?,Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia and metabolic acidosis,Hyperkalaemia and metabolic alkalosis,Hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis,Hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis,E,In rhabdomyolysis there is breakdown of muscle fibres and leakage of intracellular substances. Potassium in the main intracellular ion and thus rhabdomyolysis can lead to hyperkalaemia and metabolic acidosis.
urinary system,587,"A 60-year-old female is referred to the medical intake with serum potassium of 6.5 mmol/L. She has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), previous myocardial infarction and osteoarthritis. Which of the following medications are most likely to contribute to her hyperkalaemia?",Aspirin,Clopidogrel,Insulin glargine,Lisinopril,Salbutamol inhaler,D,"This question requires basic knowledge of medications that can contribute to hyperkalaemia. Lisinopril, as an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor is the most likely cause of her hyperkalaemia. The inhibition of angiotensin II production reduces aldosterone levels resulting in a reduction in potassium secretion in the distal tubule. This is associated with a rise in serum potassium. Anti-platelet agents themselves are not associated with potassium changes and so aspirin and clopidogrel are incorrect. Insulin and salbutamol cause potassium to shift from extra to intracellular compartments and so would not cause a rise in serum potassium."
urinary system,588,"A 16-year-old male presents with a five year history of absence seizures with three recent generalised convulsions. Which one of the following drugs, given as monotherapy, is most likely to control his seizures?",Clonazepam,Ethosuximide,Gabapentin,Sodium Valproate,Topiramate,D,"Absences, generalized tonic clonic seizures and myoclonus are features of primary generalized epilepsy. The treatment of choice includes sodium valproate, lamotrigine and topiramate. Clonazepam is useful in myoclonus, ethosuximide in isolated absences and gabapentin in partial seizures. Valproate would be the most appropriate first line agent."
urinary system,589,"For a patient aged 76 with a history of diabetes and mild renal disease, with a blood pressure of 128/70, what is his risk of contrast nephropathy?",7.50%,60%,14%,25%,1%,D,"In a patient without renal impairment, diabetes, hypotension or cardiac failure then the risk of contrast nephropathy is still as high as 7.5%. However in those aged over 75 with either renal disease, diabetes, or cardiac failure then the risk is increased to 14%. If the patient is over 75 and has renal disease and diabetes or cardiac failure this increases to 25%. The risk may be increased to about 60% if there is evidence of all three or the renal impairment at an advanced stage."
urinary system,590,A 48-year-old African man with HIV was prescribed a combination of antiretroviral therapy. He developed increased diffuse pigmentation of the nails in both hands and toes. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the increased pigmentation of the nails?,Efavirenz,Lamivudine,Nevirapine,Tenofovir,Zidovudine,E,Zidovudine causes increased pigmentation of the nails in black patients. Efavirenz causes central nervous system toxicity not hyperpigmentation. Lamivudine does not normally cause hyperpigmentation of nails but it can occasionally cause hyperpigmentation of the skin in black people. Nevirapine does not cause hyperpigmentation of skin but can cause acute hepatitis and skin rash. Tenofovir can cause proximal tubular damage hence Fanconi-like syndrome. 
urinary system,591,"A 67-year-old man has drunk 8 units of alcohol a day for most of his adult life. He has worsening symptoms of poor memory, a wide-based gait and urinary incontinence for ten months. What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV encephalitis,Meningovascular syphilis,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,Syringomyelia,Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome,C,"The triad of memory loss, gait difficulties and urinary incontinence will lead towards the diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus. In this scenario, the alcohol is a distractor. HIV encepehalitis and meningovascular syphillis would unlikley have such pronounced motor symptoms and often happen over a longer time period.  Syringomyelia presents commonly with motor symptoms and not cognitive decline.  Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome is not impossible given his alcohol history but would not present with incontinence."
urinary system,592,"A man developed Helicobacter pylori related duodenal ulcer after kidney transplantation. He did not use aspirin; other concurrent medication included cyclosporine, prednisolone, azathioprine and amlodipine. The patient reported no known drug allergy. What is the most reasonable eradication treatment regimen?",Bismuth + pantoprazole + metronidazole + tetracycline,Monotherapy with proton pump inhibitor,Pantoprazole + amoxicillin,Pantoprazole + amoxicillin + clarithromycin,Pantoprazole + metronidazole + clarithromycin,A,"Clarithromycin is relatively contraindicated in kidney transplant recipients because of its interaction with cyclosporine. Quadruple therapy containing a proton pump inhibitor, bismuth, metronidazole, and tetracycline, has been shown in meta-analysis of comparative randomised controlled trials to achieve a similar eradication rate to clarithromycin-based triple therapy. Monotherapies and dual therapies (the second and third answer choices) - usually a proton pump inhibitor and one antibiotic - have always had disappointing results in eradication of Helicobacter pylori. The forth and fifth answer choices are theoretically effective in H. pylori infection, but clarithromycin interacts with cyclosporine. Being an enzyme inhibitor, this macrolide will result in an (undesirable) increase the blood level of cyclosporine. Bismuth-based quadruple therapy, as recommended in the Maastricht Consensus Report, is the main option for second-line therapy."
urinary system,593,A 25-year-old man developed bilateral loin pain and frank haematuria. His symptoms had started 24 hours after developing a sore throat. His blood pressure was 138/88 mmHg. Urinalysis was positive for blood (4+) and protein (2+). What is the most likely diagnosis?,IgA nephropathy ,Microscopic polyangiitis,Nephrolithiasis,Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,Septicaemia,A,"The acute onset of the disease is suggestive of IgA nephropathy which characteristically occurs in young males in their 20s and 30s. Haematuria occurs within 12-24 hours of pharyngitis, accompanied also by loin pain, muscle pain and fever. Prognosis is usually good especially in children. In adults, between 25-50% may develop end-stage renal failure. No specific treatment is available. Classically, the patient has streptococcal infection one to three weeks before the onset of acute nephritic syndrome (post-strep GN). There is a long prodromal systemic illness lasting months or years in microscopic polyangiitis which differs from Granulomatosis with polyangiitis in its absence of respiratory tract granulomatous inflammation."
urinary system,594,"A 52-year-old man presents to the clinic having problems controlling his blood pressure, despite taking three anti-hypertensive agents, ramipril 10 mg, indapamide 2.5 mg, and amlodipine 5 mg. Over the past few weeks, he has been monitoring his BP at home and it is rarely below 155/90 mmHg. On examination in the clinic, his BP is 160/95 mmHg, his pulse is 85 and regular. He has a left carotid bruit. Respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (135-177)   White cells 6.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 200 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 182 μmol/L (79-118)    Renal ultrasound scan showed significant size discrepancy, with the left kidney 2 cm smaller than the right. Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation to confirm the diagnosis?",Contrast CT,Duplex ultrasound scanning,IVU,Magnetic resonance angiogram,Traditional angiography,D,"The presence of difficult to treat hypertension, renal impairment, evidence of other atherosclerotic disease (carotid bruit) and discrepant renal size makes renovascular disease a distinct possibility here. Renovascular disease is the term given to disease of the arterial supply of the kidney(s) which results in renal hypoperfusion. This leads to hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which results in hypertension and chronic kidney disease. The choice of best test for diagnosis of renovascular disease remains controversial. In practice, individual centres may have their own protocol for screening tests. However, for the purpose of the MRCP examination the following points should be followed: MR angiography (MRA) should be considered the optimum non-invasive screening test for renovascular disease, and can be performed safely in patients with CKD stage 3 and 4. However, there is increasing concern regarding gadolinium-related nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and guidelines may, therefore, change in the future. CT angiography is commonly used but can be complicated by radio-contrast nepropathy in patients with CKD. Duplex ultrasound combines measurement of proximal renal artery blood flow velocity with intrarenal restrictive index. It is an accurate test for detection of renovascular disease, and assessment of severity, but is time-consuming and high operator dependent. Intra-arterial angiography is now reserved for patients with complex anatomy, and when confirming severity prior to revascularisation. An intravenous urogram (IVU) is used to assist with the diagnosis of urinary tract stones, rather than renovascular disease."
urinary system,595,What is the most compatible joint finding of patients suffering from Henoch-Schönlein purpura?,Erosive arthropathy,Preponderance of temporomandibular joint,Symmetrical small hand joints,"Transient non-deforming oligoarthritis, mostly large joints of the legs",Typical enthesitis,D,"The arthritis of Henoch-Schönlein purpura is usually transient or migratory, involves one to four joints, and is non-deforming. Typical sites are the lower extremity large joints (hips, knees, and ankles). Affected young children may refuse to walk. Kidney manifestation occurs only in 10-50% of patients with the disease. Purpura is the sine qua non of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. It may be difficult to diagnose this disease if the patient first presents with kidney involvement or joint manifestation. Joint disease of Henoch-Schönlein purpura does not cause any chronic damage, as opposed to that of rheumatoid arthritis (hence Erosive arthropathy is incorrect). Symmetrical joint involvement of hands is atypical. Enthesitis, inflammation of the region of attachment of tendons and ligaments, is a feature of ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthritis."
urinary system,596,With which of the following does a broad-based ataxic gait characteristically occur?,Basal ganglia lesion,Cerebellar vermis lesion,Phenytoin toxicity,Proximal myopathy,Right-sided cerebral infarction,C,"Broad based gait is associated with cerebellar syndrome. However, lesions of cerebellar vermis cause truncal ataxia and tendency to fall backwards. Basal ganglia disease causes extrapyramidal signs with Parkinsonism (festinant gait, marche à petits pas). Proximal myopathy causes a waddling gait. Right-sided cerebral infarction is associated with a hemiplegic gait."
urinary system,597,"A 40-year-old gentleman required high doses of intravenous diuretics after his renal transplant for the purposes of fluid management. Soon after administration, he developed hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo. Which diuretic is most likely to have caused this?",Acetazolamide,Bendroflumethiazide,Furosemide,Spironolactone,Triamterene,C,"Use of diuretics has variable side effects, predominantly electrolyte derangement. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are associated with ototoxicity. Thiazide diuretics such as bendroflumethiazide do not have this association; neither do potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone and triamterene. Acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is not usually associated with ototoxicity."
urinary system,598,"Creatinine has a number of limitations as an estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), including variation with muscle mass and age. Which of the following answers represents a novel marker of estimating GFR?",Alpha amyloid protein,Cystatin c,Inulin,Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1),Nystatin,B,This question demonstrates knowledge of markers of glomerular filtration rate. Serum creatinine has limitations as a marker of GFR. Nystatin is an antifungal agent and not a marker of GFR. Inulin is a valid marker of renal function and was used experimentally in the past for many years. Alpha amyloid protein and IGF-1 have no role in estimating renal function. In regards to Cystatin C it is now a much more sensitive marker of kidney function as opposed to insulin and insulin resistance. More recent studies have proven this and can be referenced below.   
urinary system,599,By which of the following is a demyelinating polyneuropathy typically caused?,Diabetes ,Excessive alcohol ,Hereditary motor sensory neuropathy,Renal failure ,Vitamin B12 deficiency,C,"The differential diagnosis of demyelinating neuropathy includes:  Hereditary motor sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease) Refsum's disease Guillain-Barré syndrome Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) Paraprotein-related disorder, and Leukodystrophies.  An axonal polyneuropathy may be caused by:  Diabetes Alcohol Vitamin deficiencies, and Renal failure.  Some drugs, such as amiodarone, can cause a mixed demyelinating and axonal picture."
urinary system,600,A 69-year-old male presents with cognitive impairment and a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is suspected. What is the most appropriate test of short term memory?,Assessing orientation in time,Assessing serial 7s,Knowledge of the capital of the UK,Providing their home address,Recall of the doctor’s name at the end of the consultation,E,"Short term memory impairment is the commonest clinical presentation of Alzheimer's disease. Usually patients are fully orientated in time, person and place. Long term memory is usually intact. The best way to test short term memory is to ask the patient to recall new information in the next few minutes."
urinary system,601,"A 17-year-old male has been diagnosed with schizophrenia four weeks ago. He was started on haloperidol. Two weeks later he was found confused and drowsy. On examination he was pyrexial (40.7°C), rigid with blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg. Which of the following treatments would you initiate?",Aciclovir,Cefuroxime,Dantrolene,Diazepam,Phenytoin,C,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is the most likely diagnosis. Its major features are:  Rigidity Altered mental state Autonomic dysfunction Fever High creatinine kinase.  It is usually caused by potent neuroleptics. The treatment of choice is dantrolene and bromocriptine. Withdrawal of neuroleptic treatment is mandatory. Rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure are potential complications.
urinary system,602,Cerebral malaria is caused by which of the following?,Plasmodium falciparum,Plasmodium knowlesi,Plasmodium malariae,Plasmodium vivax,Plasmodium yoelii,A,"Of the Plasmodium species, only Plasmodium falciparum invades the central nervous system, causing cerebral malaria. The neuropathology of cerebral malaria consists of diffuse cerebral swelling, widespread small-ring haemorrhages located in the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres, and plugging of cerebral capillaries and venules by parasitised erythrocytes; pigmentation with haemozoin is quite typical. Focal neurologic deficits are relatively uncommon in cerebral malaria and are usually caused by a cerebral infarct due to arterial thrombosis occurring during the acute phase of the disease. Plasmodium knowlesi can be uncomplicated or severe like falciparum but without CNS involvement. Plasmodium malariae and yoelii are less severe than Falciparum or Vivax."
urinary system,603,"A 24-year-old man presents with a headache that has been present for nine months. He has headache almost every day, mainly frontal, sometimes with nausea. Current medication includes paracetamol, brufen and codeine with only transient relief of symptoms. He has a history of depression. Examination was normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Analgesic misuse headache,Cluster headache,Frontal brain tumour,Headache due to depression,Migraine,A,This is one of the commonest causes of chronic daily headache (the commonest is chronic tension type headache). It is commonly caused by the chronic use of analgesics such as codeine phosphate and paracetamol. Treatment consists of reducing the amount of analgesics gradually until stopped.
urinary system,604,Which one of the following statements regarding renal function is correct?,A ten minute period of hyperventilation will normally be expected to lead to an increased rate of bicarbonate excretion in urine,Sodium reabsorption in the tubules is mainly controlled by aldosterone,The daily solute excretion will lie between 75 and 300 mosmol,The permeability of the proximal nephron to water increases in the presence of vasopressin,The rate of ammonium excretion in urine is inversely related to the rate of urinary hydrogen ion excretion,A,Arginine vasopressin (AVP) acts on the collecting ducts increasing permeability to water. The total solute excretion is approximately 700 mosmol/d. Sodium reabsorption is mostly through active transport in the loop of Henle with only a modest reabsorption facilitated by aldosterone. A ten minute period of hyperventilation would cause a respiratory alkalosis leading to an increased secretion of bicarbonate and retention of hydrogen ions. The rate of ammonium excretion is proportional to the rate of hydrogen ion excretion.
urinary system,605,Which of the following is true of cystic fibrosis?,A sweat chloride concentration of 80 mmol/l is diagnostic,Is an autosomal dominant condition,Is associated with learning difficulties,Is due to mutation of CFTR gene on chromosome 17,Median survival rate is 10 to 15 years,A,"Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive condition and is due to mutation of CFTR gene on chromosome 7. Median survival rate is 25 to 35 years and is currently improving. It is not associated with learning difficulties.   Presentation varies with age. Sweat testing confirms the diagnosis and is 98% sensitive - chloride concentration greater than60mmol/L with sodium concentration lower than that of chloride on two separate occasions. Screening was introduced in 2007 (immunoreactive trypsinogen on the newborn blood spot test), and therefore clinical diagnosis later in life should be becoming less common.   "
urinary system,606,A 50-year-old male presents with a 12 month history of deteriorating memory. He has otherwise been well and takes no medication. Which one of the following is most typical of frontal lobe dysfunction?,Inability to draw a clock face,Inability to generate a list rapidly,Inability to perform serial 7s,Sensory inattention,Visual field defects,B,"Frontal lobe dementia is a common neurodegenerative condition. It usually affects patients of 45-65 years old. A failure to generate a list rapidly is a test of frontal lobe (for example, name animals in 60 seconds or words beginning with the letter F, etc). Dyscalculia is a manifestation of the dominant parietal lobe. Sensory inattention is a manifestation of parietal lobe dysfunction. Visual field defect is a manifestation of the following pathology:  Occipital lobe (homonymous hemianopia) Temporal lobe (superior quadrantanopia) or Parietal lobe (inferior quadrantanopia)."
urinary system,607,A 25-year-old woman who is 20 weeks pregnant is diagnosed with pyelonephritis. She had suffered recurrent urinary infections since childhood and her family history reveals that her mother had a history of hypertension and had been told she had a kidney problem. Examination was normal and urea and creatinine were both normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,Bladder outlet obstruction,Normal physiological urinary stasis of pregnancy,Reflux nephropathy,Renal stone disease,D,This lady has had recurrent urinary tract infections since childhood and now presents with pyelonephritis. Pyelonephritis is an uncommon infection in pregnancy and requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics. It is associated with preterm labour in 4% and may lead to fetal distress. The answer is not autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) as symptoms do not tend to occur before the age of 40. Bladder outlet obstruction should not occur in pregnancy and would cause hydronephrosis and worsening renal function. Normal physiological urinary stasis of pregnancy is incorrect as this should not cause pyelonephritis. Renal stone disease does predispose to developing urinary tract infections but is less likely than reflux nephropathy. The correct answer is reflux nephropathy. This lady has a long history of urinary tract infections with probable underlying reflux scarring and this would predispose her to developing pyelonephritis in pregnancy.
urinary system,608,"In a patient with gout, what renal disorder may they develop related to this?",Renal stones,Neurogenic bladder,Glomerulonephritis,Polycystic kidney disease,Tumour lysis syndrome,A,In gout there is hyperuricaemia and this may lead to the formation of uric acid renal stones.
urinary system,609,"In renal osteodystrophy, what would you expect to find?","Increased phosphate excretion, increased parathyroid hormone levels and reduced 1,25 OH vitamin D","Reduced phosphate excretion, decreased parathyroid hormone levels and reduced 1,25 OH vitamin D","Reduced phosphate excretion, decreased parathyroid hormone levels and increased 1,25 OH vitamin D","Reduced phosphate excretion, increased parathyroid hormone levels and reduced 1,25 OH vitamin D","Increased phosphate excretion, decreased parathyroid hormone levels and reduced 1,25 OH vitamin D",D,In renal osteodystrophy there is increased parathyroid hormone secretion due to reduced 1 hydroxylation in the kidneys and reduced renal excretion of phosphate.
urinary system,610,Which of the following statements regarding idiopathic membranous nephropathy is correct?,Immune complex deposits are typically seen in the glomerular mesangium,It characteristically presents in the first decade of life,Males are twice as commonly affected as females,Progression to end-stage renal failure is rapid,The nephritic syndrome is a characteristic presentation,C,Membranous nephropathy is characterised by thickened basement membranes and monotonous granular deposits of IgG and C3 distributed in the epimembranous space of virtually all glomerular capillaries. The mesangium may be involved at a later stage of the disease and is more typical of secondary disease. It is typically seen in the over 40 age group with a male predominance of 2 to 1 and is associated with a variable prognosis with 25% developing ESRF over 10 years and 25% going into remission. There is a higher rate of remission for the idiopathic form. The majority of patients manifest with a pure nephrotic syndrome. A nephritic presentation is rare.
urinary system,611,"A 51-year-old homosexual, Caucasian, HIV positive man developed multiple violaceous painless lesions on his trunk. Which one of the following is the most likely cause of his skin lesions?",Cytomegalovirus (CMV),Human herpes virus 8 (HHV8),Human herpes virus 10 (HHV 10),Human papilloma virus 16 (HPV 16),Pox virus,B,Multiple violaceous painless lesions are typical of Kaposi's sarcoma in Caucasians. This is associated with HHV 8. CMV and HHV 10 do not cause multiple violaceous painless lesions. HPV 16 is an oncogenic virus which causes squamous cell carcinomas. Pox virus causes molluscum contagiosum with the lesions often being skin coloured and indurated.
urinary system,612,A 67-year-old woman is referred to a neurologist complaining of difficulty getting out of her chair. She is noted to have discrete erythematous papules over her metacarpophalangeal joints. Her creatine kinase (CK) is 4000. What is your diagnosis?,Dermatomyositis,Myasthenia gravis,Myotonic dystrophy,Polymyositis,Polyneuropathy,A,"Dermatomyositis is correct as the high CK, proximal muscle weakness and skin changes suggest dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis and polymyositis are related conditions that present with proximal muscle weakness. Dermatomyositis has cutaneous signs such as Gottron's papules, discrete erythematous papules over metacarpophalangeal joints, and a heliotrope rash. Myasthenia gravis and myotonic dystrophy are incorrect as they would not produce a pattern of either distal or proximal myopathy. Polymyositis is incorrect as it is not associated with skin changes. Polyneuropathy is incorrect as it produces a distal rather than proximal neuropathy."
urinary system,613,"A 70-year-old man presents with difficulty speaking. He has a history of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He is currently on aspirin, simvastatin, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide. On examination the patient is awake; his blood pressure is 150/70 mmHg. His pulse is irregularly irregular. He has 4/5 strength on the right arm and leg and 5/5 strength on the left. When asked to point to the window he appears unable to do so. When told to raise his arms and place his hands out he does not. When visually shown the same action he is able to perform it. When asked to repeat 'Today is a sunny day', he is unable to do so. He appears frustrated and makes no intelligible words. With what type of dysphasia is this consistent?",Broca's aphasia,Global aphasia,Transcortical motor aphasia,Transcortical sensory aphasia,Wernicke's aphasia,B,"In Broca's or non-fluent or expressive aphasia the patient is unable to name objects with poor comprehension and repetition. It localises to the Broca's area in the left posterior inferior frontal gyrus. In transcortical motor aphasia, which localises to the anterior superior frontal lobe, the patient has good comprehension and repetition but has halting, effortful speech. Patients also have impaired writing skills. Transcortical sensory aphasia is characterised by impaired auditory comprehension with intact repetition and fluent speech, and is caused by damage to the temporal lobes. It differs from Wernicke's aphasia in that patients still have intact repetition, and exhibit echolalia (the compulsive repetition of words). Improvement may be seen with speech therapy. In Wernicke's or fluent or receptive aphasia the patient is able to form correct grammatical sentences but language content is incorrect. It localises to the dominant superior temporal gyrus. There is poor comprehension and repetition but verbal output is fluent. Global aphasia is what is described in this case. It results in an almost mute patient with deficits in all aspects of language: spontaneous speech, naming, repetition, auditory comprehension, reading and writing. Global aphasia is commonly seen in patients with large infarctions of the left cerebral hemisphere, usually due to occlusion of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery. This results in resulting in damage of Broca's, Wernicke's and the arcuate fasiculus. It is also usually associated with right hemiplegia and right homonymous hemianopia, but it is increasingly recognised in isolation. The visual centres remain intact and therefore patients are able to follow instructions shown to them. "
urinary system,614,A 36-year-old Caucasian woman was successfully treated for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). She was re-admitted with acute breathlessness with left-sided chest pain ten days after her discharge from the hospital. Examination revealed that she was hypoxic and found to have diminished breath sounds on the left side of chest. What is the most likely cause of her recent admission?,Acute myocardial infarction,Acute pericarditis,Acute pulmonary embolism,Left lobar pneumonia,Pneumothorax,E,Pneumothorax is a well-known complication of PCP. An acute history of chest pain with breathlessness and diminished breath sounds is typical of pneumothorax. Diminished breath sounds are not a feature of acute myocardial infarction or acute pericarditis. Acute pulmonary embolism should be considered due to her recent admission but diminished breath sounds are not a feature. There are no signs of consolidation to consider lobar pneumonia.
urinary system,615,A 82 years with multiple comorbidities with vault prolapse. How to initially treat?,ASC,SSF,Pessary,Colpocleisis,Laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy,C,Vaginal pessaries are an alternative treatment option for women with stage II-IV PHVP
urinary system,616,A 30-year-old female was commenced on carbamazepine for partial complex seizures and was also advised to discontinue her moderate alcohol consumption. Therapeutic concentrations of carbamazepine were achieved within four days with a dose of 200 mg daily but the dose needed to be increased to 400 mg daily within two weeks to achieve a therapeutic plasma concentration. Which one of the following is likely to account for this observation?,Auto-induction of carbamazepine metabolism,Auto-inhibition of carbamazepine metabolism,Cessation of alcohol intake,Concomitant prescription of the oral contraceptive pill,Reduced bioavailablity of carbamazepine,A,Alcohol is a liver enzyme inducer therefore stopping the alcohol should increase the activity of the carbamazepine not reduce its activity. It is well recognised that carbamazepine is a P450 enzyme inducer but it is less well appreciated that it causes auto-induction and so would require increase in dose to maintain the same therapeutic concentration. 
urinary system,617,A 26-year-old man presented with a 24 hour history of blurred vision in the left eye and mild left frontal headache. He had a ten year history of diabetes mellitus. Examination of the left eye revealed a central scotoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Central retinal artery occlusion,Diabetic retinopathy,Migraine,Optic neuritis,Pituitary tumour,D,"Occlusion of the central retinal artery or one of its branches which supplies the macular region will result in almost immediate diminution or loss of visual acuity in the involved eye and is usually without pain. In a young diabetic the aetiology is usually an embolus of the central retinal artery or one of its branches. However there is pain associated with this visual loss, namely headache. Diabetes is a cause of optic neuritis which is usually associated with headache. Retinopathy, per se, would not lead to an acute central scotoma unless there was acute bleeding from neovascularisation."
urinary system,618,"A 25 year old nulliparous woman presents with a 3 month history of intermittent dysuria, urinary urgency and frequency about 10 times during the day with no nocturia. She had no fever and has been generally well. She was seen by her GP and prescribed trimethoprim for 3 days. The symptoms settled for about a week and then returned. She has no significant past medical or surgical history and is otherwise fit and well. She has no allergies. Her general, abdominal and vaginal examination found no abnormality. Her urine analysis showed: ++ leucocytes, + protein, + nitrites, + RBC. What is the most appropriate next management step?",Bladder retraining,Cystoscopy,Renal tract ultrasound,Send mid stream urine sample for microbiology and start treatment with cephalexin 500 mg three times daily for 7 days,Start treatment with trimethoprim 100 mg twice daily for 7 days,D,"Based on her symptoms and urine analysis she has an acute UTI.Although her GP prescribed trimethoprim for 3 days the infection appears to be resistant to trimethoprim. Hence, a broad spectrum antibiotic should be prescribed for at least 7 days. Microbiology results should reviewed when available and, if indicated, the antibiotic should be changed according to the sensitivity test. If her symptoms recur further investigations including a renal tract ultrasound scan and a cystoscopy is indicated."
urinary system,619,"A 46-year-old gentleman is diagnosed with epilepsy and started on sodium valproate, which fails to control his seizures. What is the likelihood of him being seizure-free given he is refractory to first line anti-epileptics?",8%,14%,20%,35%,47%,B,A study of patients with previously untreated epilepsy demonstrated that 47% achieved control of seizures with the use of their first single drug. Fourteen per cent became seizure-free during treatment with a second or third drug. 
urinary system,620,A 45-year-old man had recurrent nephrolithiasis. Renal function tests and serum calcium measurements were normal. A 24-hour urine collection revealed:    Volume 3 L   Calcium 15 mmol/24 hours (2.5-7.5)   Oxalate 200 mmol/24 hours (90-450)   Uric acid 3 mmol/24 hours (1.48-4.45)   Citrate 2 mmol/24 hours (0.3-3.4)    What therapy should be tried first to reduce stone formation?,Allopurinol,Dietary calcium restriction,Penicillamine,Potassium citrate,Thiazide diuretic,B,"It is likely this patient has absorptive hypercalciuria, which predisposes to stone formation. A combination of treatments is usually required to reduce the chance of stone formation, including dietary calcium restriction and pharmacological management. Both thiazide diuretics and potassium citrate can be used to reduce urinary excretion of calcium. Potassium citrate is generally preferred as it has fewer side effects, and is, therefore, better tolerated. Dietary calcium restriction alone has minimal effect on calciuria, given the large amount of calcium that can be mobilised from bone. Allopurinol is indicated if there is hyperuricosuria. Pencillamine is used in the management of hypercalciuria associated with Wilson's disease."
urinary system,621,A 62-year-old male is noted to have a broad-based ataxic gait. This is characteristic of which of the following?,A basal ganglia lesion,Cerebellar vermis lesion,Osteomalacia,Phenytoin toxicity,Right-sided cerebral infarction,D,"Broad-based gait is associated with cerebellar syndrome. However, lesions of cerebellar vermis cause truncal ataxia and tendency to fall backwards. Right-sided cerebral infarction is associated with a hemiplegic gait. Basal ganglia disease causes extrapyramidal signs with parkinsonism (festinant gait, marche à petit pas). Proximal myopathy causes a waddling gait."
urinary system,622,"A 36-year-old man has a three month history of pain in his feet and lower legs. He was diagnosed as having diabetes at age 14 and treated with insulin. He is a cannabis smoker and drinks 30 units of alcohol per week. On examination he has impaired pain and temperature sensation in feet and lower legs, normal joint position and vibration sense. His reflexes are normal. What is the diagnosis?",Alcoholic polyneuropathy,Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP),Diabetic polyneuropathy,Syringomyelia,Vitamin B12 deficiency,C,"The history suggests small fibre painful peripheral sensory neuropathy. The comonest cause is diabetes. Joint position sense and vibration are carried through large fibres, and are therefore affected later. Sensory nerves are affected more than motor so often reflexes remain intact. Vitamin B12 deficiency causes impairment of joint position and vibration. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) causes a large fibre peripheral neuropathy with areflexia. In syringomyelia you have impaired pain and temperature in the upper limbs. Typically with alcoholic polyneuropathy all fibre types are affected and it is seen with a higher alcohol consumption than 30 units. Pain is usually a more dominant feature. It should definitely feature as part of the differential diagnosis."
urinary system,623,A 21-year-old man recovered from the immediate effects of a head injury sustained in a motor cycle accident three months previously. Which one of the following is the most likely delayed consequence of severe traumatic brain injury?,Episodic hypersomnia,Multiple obsessional symptoms,Outbursts of aggressive behaviour,Pathological jealousy,Persistent anxiety,E,"The condition is post-concussion syndrome and although many of the symptoms given may be seen the commonest one (headache) has been left out. The most common symptoms are headache and neck discomfort; changes in memory, concentration, and attention; dizziness; irritability, depression or anxiety; and sleep disturbance, among other symptoms. There is:  Disturbance of thought Poor concentration span and Subjects are easily distracted.  Anxiety would seem the most common and therefore the most likely answer."
urinary system,624,"A 16-year-old girl presented with a three week history of headache and horizontal diplopia on far right lateral gaze. On two separate occasions she noted dimmed vision whilst bending forwards. Over the last year she had gained 12 kilograms in weight. On examination, her weight was 95 kg, and height 162 cm. Neurological examination revealed bilateral papilloedema and a partial right sixth cranial nerve palsy. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Multiple sclerosis,Pituitary tumour,Superior sagittal vein thrombosis,Thyroid eye disease,A,"This patient is markedly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 36 and the history suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Vision may be affected with enlargement of the blind spot; the visual obscuration with movements that provoke a rise in intracranial pressure (ICP), e.g. bending, is typical of IIH. Dysthyroid eye disease would not present like this and is more commonly associated with hyperthyroidism. The papilloedema would argue against multiple sclerosis (MS). A bitemporal hemianopia or a visual field defect would be expected with a pituitary tumour. Venous sinus thrombosis is a possibility but would be expected to produce deteriorating symptoms."
urinary system,625,"A 15-year-old girl presents with a two week history of headaches and double vision. She had also noticed an episode where her vision dimmed after sneezing. On examination her BMI was 32.4 kg/m^2, she had bilateral optic disc swelling and a partial left sixth cranial nerve palsy was present. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Graves' ophthalmopathy,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Multiple sclerosis,Pituitary tumour,Sagittal vein thrombosis,B,This patient has the features of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) which maybe associated with reduction of vision with manoeuvres that raise intracranial pressure and is associated with sixth nerve palsies. There are no features to suggest Graves' ophthalmopathy nor multiple sclerosis. A pituitary tumour would be likely to produce visual field constriction - not mentioned in this history. A sagittal vein thrombosis is a potential differential diagnosis here but is less likely than IIH.
urinary system,626,A 69-year-old man developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis complicating his Child's C liver cirrhosis. There was no sign of hypovolaemia. Which of the following measures was best supported by evidence to prevent the development of hepatorenal syndrome?,Central venous pressure monitoring,Intravenous albumin administration,Intravenous dopamine infusion,Neomycin,Regular lactulose use,B,"Administration of albumin (1.5 g per kilogram of body weight at diagnosis and 1.0 g per kilogram 48 hours later), in addition to antibiotics, has been shown in randomised controlled trial to markedly reduce the risk of hepatorenal syndrome. The mechanism of albumin is thought to be its positive effect on circulatory function and other effects, such as antioxidant properties. Judicious use of diuretics prevents renal failure but this patient has no sign of hypovolaemia. Central venous pressure monitoring is not indicated. Synthetic disaccharide lactulose is for preventing hepatic encephalopathy and has no role in preventing hepatorenal syndrome. Neomycin, by the same token, is thought to be a treatment of choice for hepatic encephalopathy (but limited evidence). In fact, it has been associated with ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity."
urinary system,627,Which of the following investigations is useful in locating an impalpable testis?,Abdominal X ray,Chromosome analysis,Radionucleotide scan,Testosterone response to HCG,Ultrasound scan,E,"If the testis is ectopic, then it may be palpable outside the normal line of descent. However in obese boys, an ultrasound scan may be useful in identifying its location. Radionucleotide scans and x rays should be avoided, and hormonal testing may be useful in cases of bilateral impalpable testes to detect the presence of testicular tissue within the body. Laparoscopy is the investigation of choice if the testes are impalpable, in order to determine whether they are absent or intra-abdominal."
urinary system,628,"A 45-year-old lady presents with fatigue and lethargy, and has established end stage renal failure. She has been on haemodialysis for the past three years and receives dialysis for three hours three times a week at a regional haemodialysis centre. At one of her regular visits for haemodialysis her blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg. Further investigations reveal:    Serum K^+ 5.2 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum corrected calcium 2.15 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Haemoglobin 90 g/L (115-165)   Creatinine 1300 μmol/L (60-110)      Which of the following is the best option for management of this lady's symptoms?",Increase dialysis hours,Treat anaemia with erythropoietin,Treat hyperkalaemia,Treat hypocalcaemia,Treat hypertension with ramipril,B,"This patient's main complaint is of fatigue. Treating her with erythropoietin would therefore be the most appropriate therapy particularly with her anaemia. There are multiple potential causes of fatigue in patients on renal dialysis. Treating her anaemia is a good first step to improving her symptoms. Her potassium is a little high, but would be considered acceptable pre-dialysis. Increasing dialysis time is unlikely to be acceptable to most patients and renal units though this is an option some patients would choose, especially those on 'home haemodialysis'. This can certainly improve fatigue due to uraemia. As with many patients on dialysis, this lady has a low calcium. This is due to inadequate 1-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxy vitamin D. PTH is usually elevated in an attempt to maintain reasonable serum calcium concentrations. Calcium can also be lost in the dialysate and the use of high-calcium dialysis bags can help reduce this. This calcium level is acceptable. Vascular disease is an important cause of death in dialysis patients and this lady may very well need additional treatment of blood pressure. "
urinary system,629,"A 65-year-old male presents with bilateral leg pain. There is no relevant past medical history, and no excess alcohol use. Both knee reflexes are reduced. Fasting glucose is 6.5 mmol/L. Which is the next investigation most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",B12 and folate,Chest x ray,CSF examination,MRI spine,Oral glucose tolerance test,E,"The suggestion of bilateral leg pain, weakness and reduced knee reflexes with an impaired fasting glucose concentration suggests a diagnosis of diabetic amyotrophy. This is confirmed with a formal OGTT. Diabetic amyotrophy is not uncommonly a presenting feature of diabetes in the elderly. The features are of an asymmetrical but bilateral quadriceps wasting and weakness with diminished reflexes."
urinary system,630,"You are asked to review a 25-year-old motorcyclist who was involved in a serious road traffic accident six weeks prior. He has had a cast removed from his left lower leg, and the orthopaedic nurses are concerned that he might have a common peroneal nerve palsy. Where are you most likely to find evidence of sensory loss?","Dorsum of the foot, sparing the 5th toe","Dorsum of the foot, particularly the 5th toe",Medial aspect of the leg,Medial plantar surface of the foot,Lateral plantar surface of foot,A,"The answer is Dorsum of the foot, sparing the 5th toe. With common peroneal nerve lesions, sensory loss is noted over the lateral calf and dorsum of the foot but the 5th toe is spared. Involvement of the leg only suggests only the superficial nerve fibres have been affected, whereas involvement of the foot only suggests isolated deep fibre involvement. In common peroneal lesions both the foot and lateral calf are involved. The motor involvement results in foot drop with sparing of plantar flexion and foot inversion. The nerve is classically compressed where it winds around the head of the fibula, which can occur when a below knee cast has been used. The medial aspect of the calf receives its sensory supply from the saphenous nerve, the plantar surface of the foot is supplied by the medial and lateral plantar nerves and branches of the tibial nerve."
urinary system,631,"An 8-month-old male baby with haemophilia is referred by his GP to the surgical outpatient clinic with history of intermittent episodes of inconsolable crying and vomiting. The parents say the baby's stools are mixed with blood. On examination, a mass is palpable over the right side of the abdomen. Choose the single most appropriate diagnosis.",Ano-rectal atresia,Intussusception,Meconium ileus,Mid-gut malrotation,Volvulus neonatorum,B,"This baby is most likely to have intussusception, which is caused due to invagination of a segment of bowel into its adjoining lower segment. It is more common in boys and usually occurs under the age of 1. Intussusception is associated with haemophilia, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, haemangiomas and gastrointestinal lymphomas. Clinical features include severe colicky abdominal pain (causing intermittent inconsolable cries with the child drawing up the legs) and vomiting. The infant may pass 'redcurrant jelly' stools and a sausage-shaped mass is palpable on abdominal examination. Rectal examination may reveal blood."
urinary system,632,"A 50 year old woman presents with urinary urgency, frequency more than ten times during the day and two to three times at night. She has no urge or stress urinary incontinence. Her filling cystometry trace is shown below. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Interrupted uroflow,Detrusor overactivity incontinence,Detrusor overactivity,Mixed urinary incontinence,Urodynamic stress urinary incontinence,C,"This is defined as urodynamic observation characterised by involuntary detrusor contraction during the filling phase, which may be spontaneous or provoked. There is no leakage of urine at the time of detrusor contraction."
urinary system,633,An 8-year-old boy has symptoms of right sided abdominal pain. He has had symptoms of UTI in the past. Abdominal ultrasound shows right-sided hydronephrosis and excretory isotope scan confirms PUJ obstruction. What is the single most appropriate management?,Pancreatic enzyme,Metoclopramide,Pyeloplasty (+/- percutaneous nephrostomy),Enema and laxatives,Aspirin,C,As there is obstruction of pelvi-ureteric junction it lead to hydronephrosis and it may need to relieve acute pressure by percutaneous nephrostomy. For cure we have to go through the procedure of pyeloplasty
urinary system,634,A 25-year-old male presents with an eight week history of difficulty walking. On examination he had increased tone and pyramidal weakness of the right leg. There was impairment of pinprick sensation in the left leg up to the groin. Which one of the following is the cause of these signs?,A central cauda equina lesion,A cervical spinal cord lesion,A lesion at the foramen magnum,A right sided thoracic spinal cord lesion,Bilateral cerebral hemisphere lesions,D,"The clinical features suggest Brown-Sequard syndrome. A hemicord lesion causes it. Ipsilateral signs include pyramidal weakness and dorsal column dysfunction (joint position and light touch) and contralateral signs include spinothalamic dysfunction (pinprick and temperature). Causes include trauma, tumours, and multiple sclerosis."
urinary system,635,"Regarding paediatric umbilical hernias, which of the following statements is correct?",All require repair in order to prevent complications,Are found in up to 15% of infants,Are often symptomatic,Have a greater incidence in the Caucasian population,The inferior epigastric artery is at risk during repair,B,"Umbilical hernias are seen in one in six children, and resolve in at least 90% of children by the age of 3 or 4. There is an increased incidence in the Afro-Caribbean population; incarceration is rare. Repair involves suture of the fascial defect, and the inferior epigastric vessels are not encountered."
urinary system,636,"A 27-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department complaining of a diffuse headache for about a week. She says that her eyes have been 'going funny' every time she bends down to put on her shoes and she has vomited every morning for the past five days. You notice that she frequently attends the Emergency department with minor problems - pelvic pain, low mood and most recently ear ache. Which of the following is the most important diagnosis to consider?",Cerebral sinus thrombosis,Depression,Drug misuse,Otitis interna,Pregnancy,A,"The most important diagnosis to consider is cerebral sinus thrombosis. This woman gives a history that is suspicious of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Vomiting in the morning is characteristic of raised ICP as it follows a period of lying flat. Bending over causes a transient increase in already raised ICP. This further compresses the optic nerve and causes visual disturbance. Patients may also notice this when coughing or straining. The patient's recent ear ache could have been a localised infection predisposing her to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It is important not to dismiss immediately patients who frequently present with minor ailments. Depressed patients may present frequently with seemingly minor ailments, however in this case it would be important to rule out cerebral sinus thrombosis first. Patients who misuse drugs may present with multiple problems such as headache and vomiting. However, this history is suspicious for cerebral sinus thrombosis so this should be ruled out as a matter of urgency . Otitis interna can cause headaches and vomiting and the patient may well have it as she was recently complaining of ear ache. However, this history is suspicious for cerebral sinus thrombosis so this should be ruled out as a matter of urgency. Pregnant patients may well vomit in the morning and have vague headaches. However, this history is suspicious for cerebral sinus thrombosis so this should be ruled out as a matter of urgency."
urinary system,637,"A 65-year-old man presents with unsteadiness, rigidity of movement and tremor of the right hand. Which of the following features most strongly suggest idiopathic Parkinson's disease?",Intention tremor,Slowness of the movement,The asymmetry of tremor,Titubation,Tremor that disappears when he sleeps,C,"This question highlights the differentiating features between idiopathic Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is diagnosed when there is bradykinesia (slowness of initiation of voluntary movement with progressive reduction in the speed and amplitude of repetitive actions) AND one of:  muscular rigidity 4-6 Hz resting tremor, or postural instability.  This can be cause by idiopathic Parkinson's disease, any of the Parkinson's plus syndromes or drug-induced parkinsonism. In order to diagnose idiopathic Parkinson's disease you must first exclude other causes:  Multiple strokes with stepwise progression of symptoms History of head injuries or encephalitis Oculogyric crises Exposure to neuroleptic agents or MPTP More than one affected relative Sustained remission Isolated unilateral features more than three years Supranucular gaze palsy, cerebellar features, early severe autonomic involvement, early severe dementia, Babinski's sign positive Cerebral tumour, hydrocephalus Negative response to large doses of L-dopa  Following this, three positive features of idiopathic Parkinson's disease must be present:  Unilateral onset Progressive features Resting tremor present Persistent asymmetry affecting the side of onset most Excellent response to L-dopa (70-100% reduction of symptoms) L-dopa response for five years or more Clinical course of ten years or more Hyposmia Visual hallucinations  Slowness of movement is therefore seen in all causes of parkinsonism. Intention tremor is seen in cerebellar disease. Titubation is more commonly associated with essential tremor rather than parkinsonism. The tremor of parkinsonism only disappears during REM sleep."
urinary system,638,Incontinence of urine in females is investigated by which of the following?,Colonoscopy,Colposcopy,Cystometry,Cystoscopy,Ureteroscopy,C,"Urography (intravenous/CT/ultrasound) may show an ectopic ureter. The cystometry is a fundamental test of bladder function and measures changes in bladder pressure with changes in bladder volume. Urodynamic investigation of bladder function means an investigation of bladder movements and tensions during different levels of filling, and involves measurement of bladder activity (cystometry) and urethral flow (uroflowmetry)."
urinary system,639,Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) plays an important role in osmoregulation. Which of the mechanisms listed most accurately describes the action of ADH on the kidney?,Carbonic anhydrase inhibition in the proximal tubule,Constriction of the efferent arteriole of the glomerular apparatus more than the afferent,Downregulation of sodium channel in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle,Insertion of aquaporin channels in the collecting duct of the kidney,Insertion of ATP dependent sodium channels in the distal tubule,D,"ADH plays a crucial role in maintaining the normal concentration of the serum. Released by the posterior pituitary, it results in the insertion of aquaporin channels in the collecting duct, allowing water reabsorption. ADH does not inhibit carbonic anhydrase, nor is it related to constriction of afferent or efferent arterioles. ADH is not associated with action on the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, or in the distal tubule."
urinary system,640,A 21-year-old female presents with joint pains and rash. On examination her blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg. Investigations reveal:    Creatinine 90 µmol/l (60-110)   Anti dsDNA antibodies Strongly positive (0-73)   24 hour urinary protein excretion 1.7 g (less than0.2)   Renal biopsy Membranous nephropathy    What is the most appropriate next treatment for her nephropathy?,ACE inhibitor for blood pressure control and prevention of progression of CKD.,Cyclophosphamide,NSAIDs for arthralgia,Prednisolone for immunosuppression,Warfarin anticoagulation,A,"This patient has systemic lupus erythematosus with the disease affecting her kidneys. The renal manifestations of SLE are highly variable, ranging from mild asymptomatic proteinuria and/or haematuria to rapidly progressive uraemia. The various presentations are difficult to classify into clinical syndromes and histological classes. Although lupus nephritis affects a third of patients early in the disease it is frequently unrecognised until nephritic and/or nephrotic syndrome with renal failure occur. Histologically, a number of different types of renal disease are recognised in SLE, with immune-complex mediated glomerular disease being the most common. The up to date International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification divides these into six different patterns:  minimal mesangial mesangial proliferative focal diffuse membranous, and advanced sclerosis.  Patients with membranous lupus nephritis tend to present with nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic haematuria and hypertension may also be seen. Biopsies show global or segmental subepithelial immune deposits or their morphologic sequelae, with or without mesangial alterations. It may occur in combination with class III or IV, in which case both are diagnosed. Progression is variable, and immunosuppression is not always needed. Cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil and azathioprine reduce mortality in proliferative forms of lupus glomerulonephritis, but the benefit is not clear in membranous forms. More important to this patient's renal disease in this patient is aggressive blood pressure control. An angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor would be first line, as it has been shown to reduce proteinuria independently of its effect on blood pressure. Warfarin is not considered an appropriate treatment as this lady has not exhibited any prothrombotic tendencies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication would treat her arthralgia but would have no effect on the prognosis of the disease. Therefore the correct answer should be ACE inhibitor for blood pressure control, but immunosuppression may well be required to manage her extra-renal disease. "
urinary system,641,Which of the following is correct regarding vasectomy?,Can be successfully reversed in 70% of cases,Involves occlusion of the seminiferous tubules,Is immediately effective,Is marginally less effective than female tubal clip occlusion,Is usually performed under local anaesthesia,E,"Most vasectomies are now done under local anaesthesia. A vasectomy involves occlusion of the vas deferens and has a failure rate less than 4 per 1,000. This compares well with quoted failure rates for female sterilisation of ~5 per 1,000. There should be two 'blank' specimens following the procedure over the next three to six months before the man can be deemed infertile. Reversal will see up to 90% of men with sperm in evidence, but only about 30% of their partners will conceive. Anti-sperm antibodies are not uncommon."
urinary system,642,You are taking part in a clinical trial for a new monoclonal antibody designed to increase the population of T regulatory cells for treating a range of T cell mediated autoimmune disorders. Which of the following is a feature of T regulatory cells?,20% of mature CD4 positive cells are regulatory T cells,CD4+ CD25+ are thought to be the most important T regulatory cell population,No CD8+ T regulatory cells exist,Regulatory cells do not express CD3 receptors,They produce large amounts of IL-2,B,"CD4+ CD25+ Fox-P3 + T regulatory cells are thought to be the most important T regulatory cell population. They are thought to play an important role in regulating immune responses after invading organisms have been tackled and preventing the development of autoimmunity. Regulatory T cells are not thought to produce IL-2. A small population of CD8+ human regulatory T cells has been identified in addition to the larger population of CD4+ regulatory cells. All T cells express the CD3 receptor, and in humans 5-10% of CD4+ cells are regulatory T cells."
urinary system,643,Which of the following is a sign of immunodeficiency in the mouth?,Gingivitis,Herpes labialis,Leucoplakia,Oral hairy leucoplakia,Oral wart,D,"Oral hairy leucoplakia is a sign of immunodeficiency. It is due to reactivation of Epstein-Barr virus infection. Gingivitis is not a sign of immunodeficiency. Leucoplakia is not a sign of immunodeficiency but it is a precancerous lesion. Herpes labialis is due to herpes simplex infection, which causes 'cold sores' in immunocompetent patients and chronic herpes labialis in immunocompromised patients. Oral warts can occur in healthy people. They are due to HPV infection usually due to benign types, 6 and 11."
urinary system,644,A 34-year-old homosexual Caucasian man developed jaundice two months after taking a combination of antiretroviral drugs. He admitted that he had had several episodes of unprotected sex with several casual male partners. His liver function showed raised bilirubin with normal transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his jaundice?,Acute hepatitis B,Alcoholic hepatitis,Atazanavir,Efavirenz,Nevirapine,C,Atazanavir causes hyperbilirubinaemia with normal transaminases and alkaline phosphatase (mimicking Gilbert's syndrome). Acute hepatitis B is unlikely with normal trasaminases and alkaline phosphatase. A mild to moderate rise in trasaminases and alkaline phosphatase occurs in alcoholic hepatitis. Efavirenz can cause acute hepatitis with raised levels of transaminases. Nevirapine causes acute hepatitis where transaminases are raised several-fold.
urinary system,645,A 55-year-old female presents with tremor of the hands which has been present for approximately five years. She has a past medical history which includes anxiety and she receives salbutamol for asthma. Examination revealed titubation and an upper limb postural tremor. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Anxiety disorder,Benign essential tremor,Multiple sclerosis,Parkinson’s disease,Salbutamol induced tremor,B,"Anxiety and drugs (for example, salbutamol, sodium valproate, theophylline, amiodarone) are commonly associated with tremor of the limbs. However, head tremor (titubation) is unusual. Essential tremor is the commonest cause of head tremor, and can be reduced with propranolol. Parkinson's disease is associated with rest tremor but not titubation. Multiple sclerosis is associated with titubation and intention tremor as well as relapse/ remitting episodes. Salbutamol causes a fine tremor and sinus taccycardia."
urinary system,646,Which of the following is correct concerning undescended testes?,Are commonly associated with a direct inguinal hernia,Are located in the abdomen in 50% of cases,Detected at one year of age have a 50% chance of spontaneously completing their descent by 5 years,Surgically relocated in the scrotum before puberty have a reduced risk of subsequent malignancy compared with no surgical relocation,Which occupy an ectopic site are usually of a reduced prepubertal size,D,"Failure to find one or both testes in the scrotum may indicate any variety of congenital or acquired conditions, for example, ectopic testes, maldescended testes, retractile or absent testes. Maldescended or ectopic testes and true undescended testicles are differentiated from each other surgically. The ectopic testis has completed its descent through the inguinal canal but ends up in a subcutaneous location. Spontaneous testicular descent does not occur after the age of 1 year. Complications include infertility in adulthood, associated hernias and torsion and tumour development in the affected testis. The patient with cryptorchidism has a 20-40% chance of developing malignancy, and those most at risk are those untreated or those whose surgery was carried out during or after puberty. "
urinary system,647,"A 30-year-old male presents to the emergency room with headache. He describes that for the last week he has been having shooting pains on one side of the face with associated tearing of that eye. He reports that for the past week he has been having similar pains intermittently. He last had an attack three months ago which lasted two weeks. He is concerned he has a brain tumour. On examination the sclera is injected and the patient appears uncomfortable. There is no neck stiffness, fundoscopy is unremarkable. Eye movements are intact, visual fields are full to direct confrontation and there is no proptosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cluster headache,Complicated migraine,Migraine with aura,Tension headache,Trigeminal neuralgia,A,Cluster headaches typically involve unilateral excruciating pain which occurs as the name suggest in clusters for a relatively short period of time. There is usually associated lacrimation. Migraine with aura does not present like this. Trigeminal neuralgia is a definite differential however it usually is associated with face pain and does not involve the eye or come in clusters. A complicated migraine typically has long tract findings of sensorimotor involvement of the limbs. This presentation is not typical for tension headache.
urinary system,648,"A 40-year-old man presents to the Emergency department. His wife says he has not been himself for the past few days, becoming aggressive over trivial things and yesterday he could not work out how to use the TV remote control. When she confronted him he told her that he had a headache. Today she found him in the kitchen picking at his clothes and smacking his lips. He would not respond to her when she called him. This lasted for a few minutes. Afterwards he was confused and unable to remember this episode. On examination his temperature is 37.9°C and he is becoming increasingly drowsy. Blood tests show a leucocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial meningitis,Drug overdose,HSV encephalitis,Listerial rhombencephalitis,Subdural haemorrhage,C,"The answer is HSV encephalitis. Patients with encephalitis typically complain of headache and have impairment of consciousness. The patient's wife gives a good history of this - he has a change in personality then becomes confused. This progresses to drowsiness on admission. The episode in the kitchen fits with a complex partial seizure. HSV typically affects the temporal lobes and may cause this. The temperature and leucocytosis also fit with an infective cause. This question emphasises the importance of a collateral history in drowsy patients - the diagnosis is in the patient's wife's description of recent events. The history is not typical for bacterial meningitis, which usually presents with obvious meningism (neck stiffness, photophobia) and signs of sepsis. An overdose of antidepressants can cause serotonin syndrome, which is associated with drowsiness, pyrexia and seizures. These seizures are usually generalised, and the history does not fit well with this option. Listerial rhombencephalitis is unlikely here. Listeria tends to affect immunocompromised patients, and causes a basal meningoencephalitis with associated symptoms of lower cranial nerve palsies and myoclonus. Subdural haemorrhage is not the answer as there is no history of trauma and the pyrexia and leucocytosis do not fit. Subdural haemorrhages are more common in the elderly and alcoholics."
urinary system,649,A 72-year-old male presents with weakness and reduced mobility. On examination he has a slow gait with reduced arm swing and a tremor is noticed in the left arm. Which of the following is the typical frequency of the rest tremor in Parkinson's disease?,2 Hz,4 Hz,8 Hz,10 Hz,12 Hz,B,"The tremor of Parkinson's disease is a rest tremor with low to moderate frequency 3 to 6 HZ. Initially the tremor is usually one-sided. As the disease progresses the tremor becomes bilateral and increases in severity. Although the classical tremor of Parkinson's disease is a rest tremor, over time an action tremor may develop. Furthermore it may increase in severity with levodopa."
urinary system,650,"A 45-year-old gentleman presents with loin pain and haematuria and is found on ultrasound examination to have polycystic kidney disease. Of note, his father died of a brain haemorrhage in his 50s. Genetic testing reveals that the patient has the PKD-1 gene mutation. On which chromosome is this gene mutation found?",Chromosome 2,Chromosome 4,Chromosome 12,Chromosome 15,Chromosome 16,E,The PKD-1 gene mutation is found on chromosome 16p. The PKD-2 gene mutation is found on chromosome 4 and gives rise to a milder phenotype. The other chromosomes do not contain the PKD-1 gene. 
urinary system,651,A 30-year-old man complains of vague pain in the loin with BP 140/90 mmHg. He is found to have proteinuria and hematuria. What is the investigation to confirm the diagnosis?,Abdominal US,ANCA,ANA,Urine microscopy and culture,Stool culture,A,The likely diagnosis is ADPKD for which US is diagnostic investigation
urinary system,652,"A 72-year-old man comes to the neurology clinic with his wife. He is driving her mad as almost every night when he tries to go to bed he feels that something is crawling over his legs and he has an irresistible urge to scratch, rub or move them, and eventually has to get up and pace around the room. He has no significant past medical history, apart from essential hypertension for which he takes ramipril 10 mg per day. On examination his blood pressure is 139/73 mmHg, his pulse is 70 and regular and he has no murmurs. Respiratory, abdominal and neurological examinations are entirely normal. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 118 g/L (135-177)   White cells 4.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 230 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 122 μmol/L (79-118)   Glucose 4.9 mmol/L (less than5.5)    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Baclofen,L-dopa,Oxycodone,Ropinirole,Sodium valproate,D,"This patient's history is typical for restless legs syndrome. Dopamine agonists such as ropinirole are the treatment of choice, with anti-convulsants such as sodium valproate being effective second line agents. Whilst opiates may be used, they are generally avoided due to long term tolerance. Secondary restless legs syndrome may be seen in those with:  diabetes mellitus anaemia, and chronic renal failure.  Symptoms can improve with correction of anaemia or control of blood sugar. The associated sleep disturbance can have a significant negative effect on the quality of life."
urinary system,653,Which of the following features are not compatible with the diagnosis of motor neurone disease (MND)?,Dementia,Dysphagia,Muscle cramps,Neck weakness,Optic atrophy,E,Ten per cent of patients with MND have dementia (frontotemporal). Optic atrophy is not a feature of MND. Other features not compatible with the diagnosis are sensory impairment and bladder dysfunction.
urinary system,654,"A 28-year-old gentleman presents to hospital feeling unwell with a few days history of diarrhoea and abdominal pain. He reports having eaten at a 'burger van' a few days ago. He has no previous hospitalisations. His initial laboratory tests show new onset renal impairment, anaemia and low platelets. His clotting is normal. Which of the following pathogens is most likely to be responsible for this presentation?",Clostridium difficile,Escherichia coli,Enterococcus faecalis,Methicillin resistant D. Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),Streptococcus viridans,B,"The question describes the clinical picture of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome with a diarrhoea prodrome. Escherichia coli is the most likely responsible pathogen. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome is a syndrome composing of the triad of:  microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia low platelets, and renal failure.  A number of pathogens are implicated including Escherichia coli, usually the O157:H7 subtype. This produces a verotoxin (also known as Shiga toxin) which binds to endothelial receptors, particularly in the renal, gastrointestinal and central nervous systems thereby causing the clinical symptoms. Thrombin and fibrin are deposited in the microvasculature and cause haemolysis of circulating erythrocytes. Platelets are also sequestered. The other pathogens which can cause HUS are Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae (type 1 and 3), HIV and Coxsackie virus. This presentation is not classical of C. difficile as we are given no risk factors for this in the question, so this option is incorrect. Enteroccocus faecalis is a bowel commensal which is unlikely to cause the degree of pathology described in this case. There is no reason to suspect this gentleman is MRSA positive. Streptococcus viridans is an upper respiratory tract and throat bacteria. This patient's presentation does not involve that organ system so this option is incorrect."
urinary system,655,"A 36-year-old male patient with a long history of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, develops double vision. On examination of his eye movements abduction of either eye elicits nystagmus in that eye. Adduction is impaired in both eyes. On MRI scanning, where will a new white matter lesion probably be evident?",Cerebellum,Cingulate gyrus,Medial longtitudinal bundle,Optic chiasm,Parietal lobes,C,"Impairment of adduction in both eyes signifies an internuclear ophthalmoplegia. This is often accompanied by nystagmus of the abducting eye. The area of the brain affected is the medial longtitudinal bundle in the brain stem which connects the third and sixth nerve nuclei. The main causes of internuclear ophthalmoplegia are:  Multiple sclerosis Tumour of the brainstem (glioma, for example) Brainstem vascular lesions, or Wernicke's encephalopathy."
urinary system,656,Which of the following is a normal bladder finding in cytometry?,Bladder capacity is 200 to 400 ml,Residual volume is 50 ml,First urge to void at 90 ml,Flow rate 10 ml/sec,None of the above,B,"For the normal female bladder, The first sensation of bladder filling occurs at volumes of 150 to 200 mL, and the strong desire to void occurs at 400 to 600 mL. The maximal cystometric capacity (usually 400 to 600 mL) is the volume that the bladder musculature can tolerate before the patient experiences a strong, uncontrollable desire to urinate.The patient's bladder gradually refilled with the fluid at a rate of 60-80 mL/min until her functional bladder capacity is reached."
urinary system,657,"A 50-year-old man is admitted to hospital unconscious, and smelling of alcohol. One hour after admission, he becomes suddenly sweaty with a regular tachycardia of 110 bpm and a BP of 100/50 mmHg. What is the diagnosis?",Alcohol withdrawal,Hepatic encephalopathy,Hypoglycaemia,Subdural haematoma,Wernicke's encephalopathy,C,"This history may make you suspect this gentleman abuses alcohol. Alcohol is a common cause of hypoglycaemia, and can be rapidly life-threatening if not recognised. Common initial symptoms are tachycardia and sweating. BM should be checked in all patients who become acutely unwell. Hypoglycaemia does not tend to cause hypotension, but you can sometimes seen a mild increase in blood pressure. However, patients who abuse alcohol often are relatively hypotensive as they are often relatively dehydrated and are thin due to minimal food intake. The classic triad of Wernicke's encephalopathy is ataxia, ophthalmoplegia and confusion. You are not given any of this information. It would also not commonly be associated with a rapid deterioration with sweating, tachycardia or hypotension. It would be unusual for alcohol withdrawal to develop this soon after admission if the gentleman was admitted smelling of alcohol. You would expect more cerebral agitation and coarse tremors, with seizures if allowed to progress. If a subdural haematoma is large enough to cause a reduction in consciousness you would expect to be told of focal neurological signs (e.g. difference in pupil size). You also tend to get Cushing's reflex (bradycardia and hypertension) rather than tachycardia and hypotension. Hepatic encephalopathy develops in those with established liver failure, so you would expect to be told there were signs of chronic liver disease in the patient if this were the diagnosis."
urinary system,658,A 27-year-old man presents with three months of difficulty walking. Examination reveals motor weakness of left leg in a pyramidal distribution with increase in tone. There is impaired pinprick sensation of right leg extending into the groin. What is the cause of these signs?,A central cauda equina lesion,A cervical spinal cord lesion,A foramen magnum lesion,A left sided thoracic spinal cord lesion,Bilateral cerebral hemisphere lesions,D,The history suggests Brown-Séquard's syndrome syndrome produced by a hemisection of the spinal cord. The clinical presentation is that of ipsilateral weakness and a loss of position and vibration below the lesion with contralateral loss of pain and temperature.
urinary system,659,Imaging changes in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) start initially in which parts of the brain?,Corpus callosum,Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate,"Hippocampus, parahippocampus",Orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate,Prefrontal cortex and anterior thalamic nucleus,D,"FTD appears to begin in the orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate regions of the frontal lobes, along with the anterior insula. Damage to the hippocampus and parahippocampus results in memory problems and has early involvement in Alzheimer's disease. The corpus callosum can be involved in multiple sclerosis where so-called Dawson's fingers can be seen. Prefrontal cortex damage can result in disinhibition and problems with social interaction and judgement and has been implicated in schizophrenia."
urinary system,660,An 18 year old male presents with features of infectious mononucleosis. However he has now noticed quite marked swelling in his face and legs. Bloods reveal a low albumin. Urinalysis reveals proteinuria and 24 hour collection reveal an protein excretion of 4g/day. There is nil of note on a renal biopsy. What is the most likely underlying cause of his symptoms?,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis,Minimal change disease leading to nephritic syndrome,Minimal change disease leading to nephrotic syndrome,Membranous nephropathy,D,"This patient has nephrotic syndrome which is characterised by proteinuria (nephrotic range), peripheral oedema, hypoalbuminaemia and hyperlipidaemia. There is increased risk of infections and thrombosis due to loss of immunoglobulin and anti thrombin III in the urine. The most common cause is minimal change disease. The diagnosis here is hinted at by the renal biopsy findings as the other options would be associated with specific changes. Minimal change disease can be secondary to infectious mononucleosis, certain drugs such as NSAIDs and malignancy, most commonly Hodgkins disease."
urinary system,661,A patient is admitted with decompensated liver disease and tense ascites. His bloods reveal an acute renal failure. He is not on any nephrotoxic drugs. He had been previously on spironolactone and furosemide for prophylaxis of ascites however these were stopped some months ago. His blood pressure is 130/80 mmHg and his renal failure does not respond to fluids. A urinalysis shows a trace amount of protein but nil else. An ultrasound of the renal tract shows no evidence of obstruction. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Glomerulonephritis,Hypovolaemia,Hepatorenal syndrome,Previous furosemide use,Sepsis,C,This patient has renal failure in the absence of hypovolaemia or nephrotoxics and in the presence of decompensated liver disease and ascites which makes hepatorenal syndrome the most likely diagnosis. There is no evidence of obstruction on the ultrasound and if glomerulonephritis were the cause then haematuria and significant proteinuria would be found. HRS is thought to be due to the combination of renal vasoconstriction secondary to activations of RAA and sympathetic nervous systems and alteration in renal prostaglandins. Other causes must be excluded before this is presumed to be the diagnosis. Terlipressin and albumin therapy should be utilised along with ensuring adequate hydration and avoiding nephrotoxics. TIPS and liver transplantation are other therapies utilised.
urinary system,662,"A 14-year-old boy attends the Emergency Department in the evening. He was well in the morning but approximately four hours ago developed sudden onset severe pain in his left testicle. On examination, his left testis appears swollen and is extremely tender to touch. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Epididymo-orchitis,Idiopathic scrotal oedema,Testicular torsion,Testicular tumour,Torsion of testicular appendage,C,"The most likely diagnosis is that of testicular torsion. As the history and examination are very suggestive of testicular torsion, it is mandatory to see whether this is the case in theatre under GA."
urinary system,663,You are assessing a patient in the clinic who had a total hysterectomy 10 years ago. She presents with a vaginal bulge. You are doing a POP Q assessment. Which points on the POP Q would be omitted?,D,C,Ba,Ap,Aa,A,"In women with hysterectomy, point C is the vaginal cuff and point D is omitted."
urinary system,664,"A 45-year-old woman presents to the GP with loss of sensation over the lateral three and a half fingers of her right hand, tenderness over her right forearm and inability to make a tight fist. She complains of pain in her right arm when twisting door handles anticlockwise. Phalen's and Tinnel's tests are negative. She is otherwise neurologically intact. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Carpal tunnel syndrome,Diabetic polyneuropathy,Multiple sclerosis,Pronator teres syndrome,Stroke,D,"Pronator teres syndrome is the correct answer as the median nerve is affected, and the pain is exacerbated by pronation. Entrapment of the median nerve by pronator teres causes a median nerve neuropathy, which is worse during pronation of the forearm. Examination involves excluding carpal tunnel syndrome and pronation of the affected forearm against resistance, which brings on the pain. Unlike carpal tunnel syndrome, the median nerve proximal to the wrist may be tender to palpation. Carpal tunnel syndrome is incorrect as Tinnel's and Phalen's tests are negative. Diabetic polyneuropathy is incorrect as diabetic neuropathies tend to be bilateral and affect the feet before the hands. Multiple sclerosis is incorrect as there is a peripheral nerve lesion. Stroke is incorrect as there is a peripheral not central nerve lesion."

motor system,1,Which of the following micro-organisms is the commonest cause of haematogenous osteomyelitis?,H. influenzae,Salmonella,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus,Causes pain and vomiting,C,"In persons with haematogenous osteomyelitis, when infection penetrates the periosteal membrane, a cloaca may form and extend into the adjacent soft tissues. Cortical sequestration can subsequently appear. In infants and young children, a suppurative process of the metaphysis may extend into the epiphysis and also lead to involucrum formation. Other abnormalities include single or multiple Brodie's abscesses usually of staphylococcal origin. On radiographs these abscesses appear as areas of radiolucency with adjacent sclerosis.  In the metaphysis, the lucent region may connect with the growth plate by a tortuous channel (that is, channel or tract sign) In the diaphysis, the radiolucent abscess cavity can be located in central or subcortical areas or in the cortex itself and may contain a central sequestrum In an epiphysis, a circular, well-defined osteolytic lesion is seen.  A cortical abscess simulates the appearance of an osteoid osteoma or a stress fracture."
motor system,2,Which of the following is correct regarding the anatomical relations of the first rib?,Subclavius attaches to the upper surface,The costoclavicular ligament attaches to the tubercle,The insertion of scalenus medius separates the subclavian vein and artery,The subclavian vein passes posteriorly to the subclavian artery,The upper trunk of the brachial plexus grooves the upper surface,A,"The first rib is short, wide, flattened, and lies in an oblique plane. The lower surface is smooth and lies on the pleura. A small scalene tubercle on its medial border marks the attachment of scalenus anterior. On the upper surface the tubercle separates an anterior groove for the subclavian vein and a posterior groove for the subclavian artery and lower trunk of the brachial plexus. Scalenus medius is attached to a roughened area behind the artery. Anteriorly the upper surface gives attachment to the subclavius muscle and costoclavicular ligament. "
motor system,3,Osteolytic foci shown on x ray in a 2-year-old child may be caused by which of the following?,Histiocytosis X,Infectious mononucleosis,Lymphoma,Rheumatoid arthritis,Rickets,A,"Radiolucent bone lesions in children may be caused by histiocytosis X (eosinophilic granulomas), leukaemia, and Wilm's tumour and with osteomyelitis. Osteomalacia causes Looser's zones (pseudofractures)."
motor system,4,Which of the following is associated with a sciatic nerve injury following a severe fracture dislocation of the hip?,An inability to stand on the heel of the affected foot,Loss of knee jerk,Loss of sensation along the medial border of the foot,Normal power of knee flexion,Unaffected ankle jerk,A,"The patient would be unable to stand on their heel or toes with a sciatic nerve lesion. Sometimes limited walking may be possible^1. The medial border of the foot is supplied by the saphenous nerve, a branch of the femoral nerve. A sciatic nerve lesion causes anaesthesia of the whole foot (except the medial border) and posterolateral calf in the lower two thirds (the medial calf is supplied by the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve). The knee jerk is mediated by the femoral nerve. There is paralysis of the hamstrings and all muscles of the lower leg and foot. If the nerve damage is in the upper thigh rather than at gluteal level, then some knee flexion (hamstrings) may be preserved. The ankle jerk is S1. The Sciatic nerve is L4,5, S1,2,3. "
motor system,5,"A 21-year-old professional footballer presents to the emergency department with severe, stabbing pain just above his right knee joint. He states that the pain was of sudden onset and happened whilst he was sprinting during a match. On examination, he walks with a limp and is unable to extend the leg. There is a swelling over the supra-patellar region and is identified to have a low-lying patella. Knee jerk is absent. What is the diagnosis?",Fracture of patella,Injury to the posterior cruciate ligament,Tear of adductor magnus muscle,Tear of biceps femoris tendon,Tear of quadriceps tendon,E,"A quadriceps tear may occur in both young athletes and older patients. The usual mechanism of injury is from kicking, sprinting or whilst being engaged in a sports activity which exerts sudden strain to the quadriceps tendon. Patients with a tear of the quadriceps tendon typically present with acute knee pain, swelling, and functional loss following a stumble or a fall. The common clinical presentations include:  Painful gait Inability to extend the knee Inability to straight leg raise, and Supra-patellar swelling.  There may be a palpable defect in the supra-patellar area and a low-lying patella, but swelling initially may obscure this finding. Conservative management is indicated for partial tears, immobilising the joint in full extension for a period of 4-6 weeks. Early surgical repair, which may require use of prosthetics is required for full tears. Neurological examination of the thigh and knee may be normal except for decreased quadriceps motor function and an absent knee jerk."
motor system,6,"A 72-year-old woman, who is a keen golfer and is normally independently mobile, trips and falls at home. She is brought to the Emergency Department where she is complaining of severe hip pain. An X ray of her pelvis shows an undisplaced intracapsular fracture (Garden Type 2). There are no signs of hip osteoarthritis on the X ray. Her BMI is 23. What treatment would you advise?",Cemented Thompson's hemiarthroplasty,Dynamic hip screw,Dynamic hip screw and plate,Non-surgical management,Total hip replacement,B,"Most patients with fractures of their neck of femur would have surgical fixation. There is limited place for conservative treatment of Garden 1 and some Garden 2 fractures. As the patient has an undisplaced intracapsular fracture, fixation with a dynamic screw would be appropriate. An alternative would be self-tapping cannulated screws. If the patient had an osteoarthritic hip and was independently mobile a total hip replacement would then be more appropriate. It would also be the secondary procedure should avascular necrosis occur. Hemiarthropalsty would not be the primary procedure in this case. This is generally reserved for the very elderly with limited life expectancy as the acetabulum will deteriorate. A dynamic hip screw with a plate is used for is used for extra-capsular fracture fixation (intertrochanteric/pertrochanteric)."
motor system,7,"You are an orthopaedics SHO assisting your registrar in a local anaesthetic day surgery list. The first case is a carpal tunnel decompression. After the patient has been positioned, anaesthetised, cleaned and draped your registrar makes the skin incision. This is in the palm from the base of the thenar eminence in a line towards the radial border of the ring finger down to the transverse flexor skin incision of the wrist (proximal limit). What is the first tendon that is seen beneath the fat?",Flexor carpi radialis,Flexor carpi ulnaris,Flexor digitorum profundus,Flexor digitorum superficialis,Palmaris longus,E,"Palmaris longus is usually the first tendon that is seen, although it is absent in approximately 10% of the population. The palmaris longus originates from the medial epicondyle of the humerus and attaches to the distal half of the flexor retinaculum and palmar aponeurosis. Its innervation is via the median nerve. It helps to flex the hand. The tendons of each of the following travel in the carpal tunnel (9):  Flexor digitorum profundus (4) Flexor digitorum superficialis(4) Flexor pollicus longus.  The median nerve also is also transmitted in the carpal tunnel. Flexor carpi radialis is beneath the flexor retinaculum but not within the carpal tunnel."
motor system,8,Which of the following is true regarding the temporomandibular joint?,Capsule is attached to the articular tubercle superiorly,Cavity is divided into three,Is a synovial ball joint,Lateral collateral ligament is weaker than the medial collateral ligament,Medial collateral ligaments are attached to the medial part of the glenoid cavities,E,"The temporomandibular joint is situated between the condyle of the mandible below and the mandibular fossa above. It is a type of synovial joint but it is lined by fibrous cartilage, rather than the hyaline cartilage typical of synovial joints. The joint cavity is divided into two by an articular disc. The capsule surrounding the joint is attached beyond the limits of the articular surfaces. Superiorly, the capsule is attached to the anterior edge of the squamotympanic fissure. Laterally, the capsule is attached to the articular tubercle, which forms the lateral limit of the articular eminence and the prominent ridge of the bone forms the lateral lip of the glenoid cavity. Medially, the capsule runs along the suture between the temporal and sphenoid bones and attaches anteriorly to the anterior end of the articular eminence. The capsule is strengthened medially and laterally by the collateral ligaments and the lateral ligaments are much stronger than the medial ligaments. The medial collateral ligaments are attached to the medial part of the glenoid cavities and the medial poles of the condyle. Superiorly, they attach to the articular tubercles and the lateral margins of the glenoid cavities, and inferiorly run obliquely downwards and backwards to the lateral pole of the condyles. On the mandibular condyle, the capsule is attached below the anterior limit of the articular surface."
motor system,9,"A 73-year-old man presents to the surgical outpatient clinic with a three month history of difficulty in passing urine. On further questioning, he states that he wakes up frequently at night to pass urine but has difficulty in voiding or in maintaining the stream. After baseline investigations, he is referred to the urologists who make a diagnosis of carcinoma of the prostate. He does not have any local or regional metastasis. He undergoes a transurethral resection of prostate and makes an uneventful post-operative recovery. Assuming he remains symptom-free for the next five years, what is the most appropriate investigation to follow up this patient's condition?",Bone scan,Computerised topographic scan,Magnetic resonance imaging,Prostate specific antigen level,Transrectal ultrasonography,D,"The prostate specific antigen (PSA) level will be the most appropriate investigation in this patient since it is an excellent marker in the follow up of patients with established prostate cancer. PSA is an enzyme produced by the prostate. Its normal function is to liquefy gelatinous semen after ejaculation, thus allowing the spermatozoa more easily to navigate through the cervix. PSA levels less than 4 ng/mL are generally considered normal; however, an age-specific PSA reference range level is widely used. Transrectal ultrasonography may be used in the diagnosis of carcinoma prostate but has no role in the follow up of the disease. CT scan may be used for staging of the disease and not for prognostic purposes. Bone scan is indicated in patients with suspected bone metastasis and again not used as a prognostic marker."
motor system,10,Which of the following regarding eponymous fractures is correct?,Bennett's fracture involves the distal ulna,Colles' fracture involves the proximal radius,Galeazzi's fracture involves the radial shaft and dislocation of the proximal radioulnar joint,Monteggia's fracture involves the proximal ulna and anterior dislocation of the head of the radius,Pott's fracture is a general term applied to fractures around the knee,D,"A Bennett's fracture is an intra-articular fracture of the base of the first metacarpal. A Galeazzi's fracture involves the radial shaft, with dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint. Monteggia's fracture is an angulated fracture at the junction of the proximal and middle third of ulna, accompanied by anterior dislocation of the radial head. A Pott's fracture is a general term applied to fractures around the ankle joint. A Colles' fracture involves the distal radius."
motor system,11,A 72-year-old man brought to the emergency department with onset of paraplegia following a trivial fall. He was treated for prostatic malignancy in the past. What is the single most probable diagnosis?,Paget’s disease,Osteoporotic fx of vertebre,Secondary,Multiple myeloma,Spondylosis,C,In male osteoporotic fracture is less common. As patient had prostatic malignancy pathological fracture from secondary metastasis to bone (here vertebra leading to paraplegia) is more common
motor system,12,Human spine contains how many segments ?,32,33,30,34,36,B,"The spine is divided into 33 segments, 24 of which are mobile."
motor system,13,A newborn infant with a fracture of the femur may have which of the following?,An over-expressed Moro reflex in the affected limb,Associated sciatic nerve palsy,Been born by Caesarean section,Evidence of bone disease elsewhere,Have an open reduction and internal fixation,D,"Twin pregnancies, breech presentation and prematurity are associated with fractures. Skeletal deformities such as osteogenesis imperfecta may be the cause. Splinting or casting is the treatment."
motor system,14,Which of the following is true regarding intertrochanteric fractures of the femur?,Are more likely to cause avascular necrosis of the femoral head than intracapsular femoral head fractures,Are treated with femoral head replacement,Can be treated with dynamic hip screw (DHS) fixation,Can cause the leg to be abducted,Typically cause shortening and internal rotation of the leg,C,Intracapsular (neck of femur) fractures of the femoral neck are more likely to cause severe damage to the blood supply of the femoral head than intertrochanteric fractures. The leg is usually shortened and externally rotated. It may be adducted because intertrochanteric fractures separate abductors from adductors across the fracture line. DHS is the commonest method of fixation. Other methods of fixation include intramedullary hip screw.
motor system,15,"Regarding osteoid osteoma, which of the following statements is correct?",Initial treatment is conservative,Is an osteolytic lesion,Is usually asymptomatic,Most commonly occurs in the iliac crest,Often undergoes malignant change,A,"Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumour which mainly affects children and young adults: 90% age 5 to 25. Malignant change is very rare. The femur and tibia are the commonest bones involved. Pain is often the presenting feature, and relief by aspirin is almost diagnostic. Many resolve spontaneously or the symptoms resolve. Initial treatment is usually conservative. Local surgery (local excision or curettage) is curative as osteomas are largely separate from surrounding normal bone. There are risk (such as pathological fracture) in lower limb long bones. Nerw treatments include CT guided percutaneos excision, percutaneous laser photocoagulation and percutaneous radiofrequency ablation."
motor system,16,"In the case of a patient sitting upright with his arms by his side, a line drawn between the inferior angles of the scapulae will correspond to the vertebral body of which of the following?",T6,T7,T8,T9,T10,B,A line drawn between the inferior angles of the scapulae corresponds to the vertebral body of T7. A line drawn between the superior margin of the iliac crests is level with the vertebral body of L4.
motor system,17,A 22-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department on a Sunday after falling on her outstretched hand after drinking alcohol the previous evening. She complains of pain in her right hand and wrist. There is no obvious deformity. She is tender when you press in the anatomical snuffbox and pull on her thumb. What is the most appropriate set of x rays to ask the radiographer to perform?,Forearm (screening x ray),Hand,Scaphoid views,Thumb,Wrist,C,"The most likely bone to be fractured is the scaphoid bone. The scaphoid bone is one of the eight carpal bones. The others are the:  Lunate Triquetral Pisiform Hamate Capitate Trapezium, and Trapezoid.  It is important to suspect a fracture of the scaphoid because as well as being the most commonly fractured carpal bone, it also has a high risk of undergoing avascular necrosis when fractured. It should also be noted that scaphoid fractures can be difficult to see even with scaphoid views. If a fracture is suspected, the patient should be treated as if they have fractured the bone even if not conformed radiologically. Missed scaphoid fractures are a common cause of litigation."
motor system,18,Which of the following is correct with regard to frozen shoulder?,It is diagnosed with shoulder radiography,It is exacerbated by shoulder physiotherapy,"It usually comprises three stages, each lasting four to eight weeks",Non-painful limitation of shoulder movements is typically found on examination,There is usually no apparent precipitant,E,"Frozen shoulder, or adhesive capsulitis, results in pain and stiffness of shoulder movements, particularly external rotation. It usually affects women more commonly than men and is found more often in the 40-60 years age group. Often patients are unaware of any precipitant which, if present, is usually minor. It usually comprises three stages, each lasting four to eight months, occasionally longer. These three phases are:  the freezing stage associated with pain/stiffness the frozen stage with persistent stiffness, and finally the thawing stage with improved mobility.  The diagnosis is a clinical one. It is best treated with conservative approaches with topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), exercises and, if necessary, intra-articular injections may be used. "
motor system,19,"A 55-year-old gardener presents with a six-week history of elbow pain with stabbing pains down the medial side of the left arm. On examination, he has pain and tenderness overlying the medial epicondyle of the elbow and painful flexion at the elbow. No sensory or motor abnormalities are detected. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Golfer's elbow,Radial nerve entrapment,Tennis elbow,Ulnar tunnel syndrome,B,"This is medial epicondylitis (lateral epicondylitis is tennis elbow). This is a typical presentation in golfers where repeated bending of the wrist, forceful twisting, and turning produces tears at the medial epicondyle. Although associated with golf, other pursuits such as gardening may cause this."
motor system,20,Which of the following is correct regarding median nerve injury at the level of the wrist?,Can result from carpal dislocation,Causes sensory loss over the little finger,Is commonly seen in children,Leads to motor loss of all the thenar muscles,Leads to paralysis of the flexors of the wrist and fingers,A,"Median nerve (C5 - T1) is commonly injured near the wrist in adults due to lacerations in front of the wrist or by carpal dislocation, although the nerve can be injured anywhere along the arm or the forearm from trauma. In children, by contrast, the median nerve is commonly injured at the level of the elbow frequently due to supracondylar fractures of the humerus. Median nerve injuries at the wrist cause sensory loss over the thumb, index, middle, and occasionally ring finger (lateral half); motor loss includes the thenar group of muscles except adductor pollicis (supplied by ulnar nerve) and the lateral two lumbricals. There is paralysis of the flexors of the wrist and fingers (with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial part of flexor digitorum profundus) and pronators of the forearm only if the injury is at the level of the elbow."
motor system,21,Which is correct regarding thoracic outlet syndrome?,A cervical rib is present in 2% of the population,Has typically bilateral symptoms,"Is due to compression, occlusion or damage of the subclavian vein in the neck",Is frequently due to apical lung tumours,"Pain - shoulder, arm or hand - is the most common presentation",E,"Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is caused by compression of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery or subclavian vein in the thoracic outlet. Almost all patients (95%) present with neurological symptoms. There are many non-anatomical causes such as repetitive pressure from sports including weight lifting, archery, swimming and tennis or occupations involving repeated overhead work such as plastering, painting, and shelf stacking. Obesity and poor posture can also be causes. Trauma, such as fractured clavicle, may cause TOS. The commonest anatomical cause of arterial symptoms is a cervical rib, which occurs in 0.4% of the population. Although 70% of cervical ribs are bilateral, symptoms tend to be unilateral. Neurological symptoms and signs include:  pain paraesthesia weakness, and muscle wasting.  Vascular symptoms and signs include:  distended arm veins which do not collapse even on limb elevation venous thrombosis cyanosis oedema arterial thrombosis (acute ischaemia or claudication) and embolisation (digital ischaemia), and post-stenotic dilatation and aneurysm formation."
motor system,22,"A 7-year-old girl has an angulated left elbow after a fall from a swing. She has a cold left hand with no palpable brachial, radial or ulnar pulses. A plain radiograph of the elbow shows a displaced left humeral supracondylar fracture (Milch Type1/Gartland ll). Which is the most appropriate initial management?",Backslab plaster and review in fracture clinic,Heparinisation,Manipulation of the fracture under anaesthetic,Closed reduction and percutaneous pinning of the fracture,Surgical exploration of the left brachial artery,D,"Supracondylar fractures frequently result in complications, such as:  Vascular Nerve injury Compartment syndrome, or Malunion.  Arterial injury occurs in 5% of fractures and results from the brachial artery becoming kinked over the anterior prominence of the proximal fragment or from laceration. The distal circulation should be checked carefully and recorded in the patient's notes. Initial management includes analgesia and an emergency reduction of the fracture into a good anatomical position. This usually results in an unkinking of the brachial artery and restoration of the distal blood flow. Displaced Milch Type 1/Gartland ll fractures are usually treated with percutaneous pinning. If blood flow is not restored a surgical exploration of the brachial artery should be performed by a vascular surgeon. Lacerations of the artery are either repaired primarily (with sutures) or with a vein graft."
motor system,23,Which of the following is true regarding the shoulder joint?,Capsule includes the origin (attachment) of the long head of biceps muscle,Capsule is taut inferiorly,Is only partially reliant on soft tissues structures for stability,Is supplied by the accessory nerve,Synovial cavity does not communicate with the subscapular bursa,A,The shoulder joint (gleno-humeral joint) is a ball and socket joint (synovial type). It is totally reliant on soft tissue structures for both static and dynamic stability. The capsule is attached around the glenoid cavity and extends on to the base of the coracoid process superiorly to include the biceps attachment (long head). The capsule of the joint is lax inferiorly allowing wide abduction of the joint. The two major bursae of the shoulder joint are: subacromial (superiorly) and subscapular (anteriorly).The subacromial bursa does not normally communicate with the synovial cavity while the subscapular bursa communicates with the synovial cavity. The joint is supplied by the axillary and suprascapular nerves.
motor system,24,"Regarding Perthes' disease, which statement is correct?",Is due to avascular necrosis of the distal femoral epiphysis,Is more common in girls,May require surgical containment with a dynamic hip screw,"Plain x ray may show the capital femoral epiphysis to be smaller, denser and flatter",Usually presents before the age of 5,D,"Perthes' disease is due to avascular necrosis of the proximal femoral epiphysis. It characteristically presents with hip pain and a limp, usually between the ages of 4 and 10. The male to female ratio is 4:1. An x ray will show the capital femoral epiphysis to be small, dense and flattened. A bone scan shows a cold spot within the epiphysis. Treatment is controversial and the the results of non-surgical and surgical treatment are variable and often comparable. Femoral or innominate osteaotomy are the main surgical treatments. Femoral osteotomy may cause limb shortening and a permanent limp."
motor system,25,"A 33-year-old professional ice hockey player presents to his general practitioner with a 10 day history of weakness in his right arm. He gives a history of sustaining an injury to the right arm during a game of ice hockey when he was hit directly across the back of the arm by the opponent's stick. He states that he felt a tearing sensation and severe pain in his arm immediately after the injury. On examination he is unable to extend his forearm. A palpable gap is felt at the posterior compartment of the arm, just above the olecranon process. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Fracture of the shaft of humerus,Injury to median nerve,Injury to musculocutaneous nerve,Tear of biceps tendon,Tear of triceps tendon,E,"The signs and symptoms in this patient are suggestive of a tear of the triceps tendon. The most common method of injury to the triceps tendon is from fall on the outstretched hand with the elbow in mid flexion, with or without a concomitant direct blow to the posterior aspect of the elbow or arm. The pathognomonic features of triceps tendon rupture are inability or weakness of extension of the elbow and a palpable gap in the substance of the muscle. Depending on the duration of the injury, bruising, ecchymosis, and localised tenderness may be present. Further imaging studies may be necessary to help to define the exact extent of the injury."
motor system,26,A 45-year-old man felt a sudden pain in the lower back while weight training. His paraspinal muscles are in spasm and he has an altered sensation down the back of both his legs. He is unable to pass urine. Plain X rays of his spine do not reveal a fracture. Which is the most likely diagnosis.,Lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse,Lumbar spinal stenosis,Multiple myeloma,Secondary metastatic deposit in the vertebrae,Spondylolisthesis L4/5,A,"Lumbar intervertebral disc prolapse usually affects men in their middle age. It is mainly caused by a sudden lifting of heavy weight, or it may be precipitated by trauma. L4/5 and L5/S1 discs account for about 90% of the cases. The acute clinical presentation includes acute back pain, with radiating pain along the legs, paraesthesia and motor weakness in the event of nerve root compression. In severe bilateral nerve root compression there may be bowel and bladder incontinence and sexual dysfunction. On examination, the paraspinal muscles may be in spasm and the patient may lean away from the side of the pain with the hip and knee flexed in an effort to reduce the leg pain."
motor system,27,A 24-year-old man is playing football. He is tackled heavily and sustains and isolated fracture of his right tibia with an intact fibula. The injury is closed. He is placed into an above knee backslab in the accident and Emergency department. He is comfortable in this. He is referred to you as the on call trauma SHO. What should you do next?,Admit the patient to the ward for observation,Discharge patient allowing weight bearing as able with fracture clinic follow up,Discharge patient non-weight bearing with fracture clinic follow up,Inform trauma theatre immediately so that the patient can have emergency surgery,Organise an emergency CT scan from Emergency department,A,"One of the major complications of this type of fracture is compartment syndrome. This patient is at particular risk as his muscular compartments will already be pumped with blood from exertion. He should therefore not be sent home, but admitted to the ward for elevation of his leg and closed monitoring for compartment syndrome. The fracture may be treated conservatively and may not need any surgical fixation."
motor system,28,The plane of the pelvic inlet is at what angle to the horizontal?,45,15,35,60,75,D,The plane of the pelvic inlet is at angle 60 to the horizontal
motor system,29,"A 57-year-old woman who has previously consulted a neurosurgeon due to neck problems falls from the top of stairs. She states that she landed directly on her face, with her neck being forced backwards. On examination, the patient has loss of motor function of both the upper and lower limbs, but the upper limbs appear to be much more affected than the lower. What is the name of this spinal cord syndrome?",Anterior cord syndrome,Brown-Sequard syndrome,Central cord syndrome,Posterior cord syndrome,Spinothalamic cord syndrome,C,"Central cord syndrome classically occurs in a patient who already has cervical canal stenosis. It is characterised by a greater loss of power in the upper (rather than the lower) limbs, with varying degrees of sensory loss. Brown-Sequard syndrome is caused by hemi-section of the cord and results in ipsilateral motor loss and loss of position with contralateral pain and temperature loss."
motor system,30,The biceps jerk is elicited by which nerve roots,"C5, C6","C7, C8","C8, T1",L1,"L3, L4",A,"The biceps jerk is elicited by supporting the patient's forearm on yours, this produces relaxation, as well as partially flexing the patients arm. You can feel as well as see the normal response, which is contraction of the biceps muscle and flexion of the forearm. Other stretch reflexes include: ∙ Triceps reflex (C6, C7, C8) ∙ Extensor digitorum reflex (C6, C7) ∙ Patellar reflex (L2 ‐ L4)."
motor system,31,"A 73-year-old man with extensive bony metastases from carcinoma of the prostate is brought to the Emergency department by his family. They are concerned as his pain has worsened over the past few days, but increasing his morphine has only resulted in worsening drowsiness and confusion which has impacted his quality of life significantly. Currently he is managed with maximal paracetamol and 120 mg of MST BD. His past medical history includes HTN and chronic kidney disease which has been stable for years. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 141 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 7.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 193 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 132 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage his pain relief?",Change him to a three-day fentanyl patch,Reduce his MST to 80 mg BD,Reduce his MST to 100 mg BD and add naproxen as required,Start a subcutaneous morphine syringe driver,Stop his MST and titrate oramorph to his pain,C,"The key to management of bony metastases is a multimodal approach to managing pain, which involves opiates, paracetamol and an appropriate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent. This patient is on both morphine (MST - a slow release preparation of morphine sulphate) and paracetamol. In this case he is too drowsy because of his morphine, but it is not appropriate to stop it and titrate oramorph when he complains of pain. It is much more appropriate to engineer a small dose reduction and add naproxen. Whilst his creatinine is abnormal, this may improve if you are able to improve his drowsiness so that he can eat and drink. You would want to monitor it closely and make sure his renal function wasn't deteriorating with the addition of NSAIDs. It is not directly contraindicated but monitoring should take place We are given no indication that he is unable to eat and drink, so a subcutaneous morphine syringe driver is not required at this stage."
motor system,32,A 7-year-old boy is brought to the Emergency department with a painful and swollen right elbow after he fell whilst climbing a tree. On examination there is tenderness around the elbow region with obvious deformity. Radial pulse is present but feeble. He is unable to flex his right index finger and has loss of sensation over the thenar eminence and the thumb. Radiological investigation reveals a supra-condylar fracture of the right humerus with the upper fragment penetrating the skin. Which nerve is most likely to be injured in this patient?,Median nerve,Median pectoral nerve,Musculocutaneous nerve,Radial nerve,Ulnar nerve,A,Median nerve is formed by the C5 to C7 roots from the lateral cord of the brachial plexus and from the C8 and T1 roots from the medial cord. In the arm it runs in close proximity to the brachial artery and may be injured following supracondylar fractures of the humerus. Thus the radial pulse may be feeble or absent. In the cubital fossa the median nerve passes between the two heads of pronator teres. It then travels between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor digitorum profundus before emerging between the flexor digitorum superficialis and the flexor carpi radialis. The median nerve then passes through the carpal tunnel where it may be compressed to cause the carpal tunnel syndrome.
motor system,33,In proximal femoral fractures which of the following is correct?,Are preferentially treated by total hip replacement,Avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a serious complication of intracapsular fractures,Extracapsular fractures have the greatest risk of non-union,Fractures of the femoral head are more common in the old,Garden's classification of proximal femoral fractures is based on oblique radiographic images,B,"Fractures of the femoral head are more common in the young and are associated with trauma and traumatic dislocation of the hip joint. Intracapsular fractures have a higher risk of non-union since the blood supply to the femoral head is distal to proximal. Therefore, avascular necrosis of the femoral head is a serious complication of intracapsular fractures. Garden's classification of proximal femoral fractures is based on antero-posterior radiograph images and it describes the relationship of displacements between the femoral head, femoral neck and the acetabulum. Extracapsular fractures are usually managed by dynamic sliding (hip) screws or plates and reconstruction nail or intramedullary hip screw in more severe types. THR is increasingly being used as the preferred treatment for displaced intracapsular fractures, particularly for older patients."
motor system,34,Which is true of rupture of the Achilles tendon?,"After surgical correction, the ankle in kept in equinus position",Is associated with haematoma in the deep posterior compartment of the leg,Is caused by sudden relaxation of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles,Is common in young active athletes,Results in the loss of dorsiflexion of the ankle,A,"Rupture of the Achilles tendon is more common in patients over the age of 40. This is probably because the tendon is degenerate. The rupture usually occurs when the patient is involved in unaccustomed activities such as running or jumping (active athletes have a good muscle tone). Sudden contraction of the gastrocnemius and soleus muscles is resisted by the body weight leading to rupture of the tendon. Soon after the tear, a gap can be felt about 5 cms above the insertion of the tendon but there is no haematoma in the lower leg (calf). The patient is unable to tiptoe and plantar flexion of the ankle is weak or lost leading to a positive Simmond's test (reduced plantar flexion of the ankle on squeezing the calf muscle). The management is either conservative (using plaster casts) or surgical (approximation and suturing the cut ends). Following surgery, the ankle and the foot are immobilised in a below-knee plaster cast in equinus position for six to eight weeks. This is to avoid any strain on the sutured tendon."
motor system,35,"A 57-year-old male presents to the Emergency department a few months after injuring his upper limb. On examination there is wasting of the interossei on the dorsum of the affected hand, extension of the metocarpophalyngeal joints, and marked flexion of the proximal and distal interphalyngeal joints. There is no radial deviation. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of injury?",A laceration at the elbow,A laceration at the wrist,Fall from height and catching a ledge,Supracondylar fracture,Wrist fracture causing carpal tunnel syndrome,B,"The description is of a true claw hand caused by injury to the ulnar nerve. In the hand the ulnar nerve supplies the medial two lumbricals, interossei, adductor pollicis and hypothenar muscles. In the forearm, the ulnar nerve supplies flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus. The injury is likely to be at the level of the wrist rather than the elbow as we are told the proximal and distal IP joints are flexed - due to flexor digitorum profundus being intact and there is no radial deviation. You may expect radial deviation if the ulnar nerve is injured at the level of the elbow due to paralysis of flexor carpi ulnaris, which is also supplied by the ulnar nerve. A fall from height and catching a ledge would typically cause a brachial plexus injury. A supracondylar fracture can be complicated by ulnar nerve injury but this would cause signs of injury at the elbow. Wrist fracture causing carpal tunnel syndrome would lead to signs of median nerve injury."
motor system,36,Which one of the following statements relating to the hand is correct?,Damage to the median nerve will result in wasting of the hypothenar eminence,Radial nerve injury may produce wrist drop,The median nerve carries sensation from the medial half of the hand,The median nerve passes under the extensor retinaculum,The ulnar nerve supplies the opponens pollicis brevis muscle of the thumb,B,"Radial nerve damage secondary to a spiral groove fracture may produce wrist drop. The radial nerve supplies wrist and finger extensors. The ulnar nerve supplies sensation to the ulnar border of the hand and all the small muscles of the hand apart from the short flexors of the fingers, abductors and opponens of the thumb and lumbricals to the index and middle fingers. These are supplied by the median nerve. Sensation from the arm is carried by the nerve roots C5 to T1. The median nerve supplies sensation to the lateral half of the palm of the hand and the palmar aspect of the lateral three and one-half fingers, including the nail beds on the dorsum."
motor system,37,"A 39-year-old man has severe pain in his left shoulder. The pain began the night before as a dull ache but has now become quite intense. All shoulder movements are painful and restricted, especially abduction. There is tenderness at the greater tuberosity, just beneath the acromial process. Which is the most likely diagnosi?",Acute supraspinatus tendinitis,Frozen shoulder,Painful arc syndrome,Rotator cuff tear,Subdeltoid bursitis,A,"The history and clinical findings in this patient are very suggestive of acute supraspinatus tendonitis. This condition commonly affects young individuals between the ages of 25 and 45. The pain is dull aching to begin with but soon becomes agonising. Practically, all the shoulder movements are painful and limited, especially abduction. On examination, there is pain at the insertion of supraspinatus (on the greater tuberosity just beneath the acromion process). This condition is usually treated with rest and anti-inflammatory agents."
motor system,38,"During the anteriolateral (Hardinge) approach to the hip joint, after division of tensor fascia lata, which muscle is encountered before the hip joint is seen?",Gemellus,Gluteus maximus,Gluteus medius,Gluteus minimus,Sartorius,C,"The three commonest approaches to the hip joint are:  Anterior Anterolateral (Hardinge), and Posterior.  In the Hardinge approach a skin incision is made from the greater trochanter. Tensor fascia lata is divided before gluteus medius is seen. Gluteus medius is then divided to reach the capsule. In the posterior approach after skin and tensor fascia lata are divided the short external rotators are divided. There is an increased risk of dislocation with this approach."
motor system,39,Contraction of which muscle causes vocal cord abduction?,The cricothyroid muscle,The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle,The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle,The thyroarytenoid muscle,The transverse arytenoid muscle,C,The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is an important muscle as it the only muscle that abducts the vocal cords. The posterior cricoarytenoids are innervated by the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The cricothyroid muscle attaches to the cricoid and thyroid cartilage and aids with phonation. The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle attaches to the cricoid and arytenoid cartilages and are involved in airway protection and stableisation.  The thyroarytenoid muscle attaches to the arytenoid and thyroid cartilages lateral to the vocal cords and is involved in shortneing the vocal cords The transverse arytenoid muscle attaches to both arytenoid cartialges on either side of the larynx and adducts the arytenoid cartilages.
motor system,40,Which of the following is correct of surgical staples?,Are generally more expensive than skin sutures,Are painless,Are usually made from titanium,Should result in wound edge inversion,When used on the skin always result in skin hatching,A,Staples are usually made from stainless steel and thus have high tensile strength and minimal tissue reaction. If removed promptly skin hatching does not result. If applied properly they should cause wound edge eversion. They are more expensive than non-absorbable sutures. They are uncomfortable and require a special instrument to remove them.
motor system,41,"A 34-year-old male presents with weakness of the right hand. You note global wasting of the small hand muscles, there is also sensory loss over the medial border of the forearm and hand. He says he was climbing a tree to rescue a kite and fell. Whilst falling he grabbed a branch and this pulled on his arm. Injury to which of the following structures is the most likely explanation of this clinical presentation?",Cervical spine,Lower brachial plexus,Median nerve in the forearm,Radial nerve in the upper arm,Ulnar nerve at the elbow,B,"This is a classic story of a lower brachial plexus injury; sudden upward movement of the abducted arm. This causes features of an ulnar nerve palsy which is supplied by the lower brachial plexus roots C8 and T1 (Klumpke's paralysis). The median and radial nerves can be excluded because of the typical ulnar nerve findings. The ulnar nerve can be damaged at the elbow from chronic pressure, leaning on the elbows, and direct trauma. However, this injury is a stretching injury of the arm. A cervical spine injury would be expected to have other associated neurological signs."
motor system,42,Which of the following is correct regarding calcific tendonitis of the shoulder?,External rotation of the shoulder is possible,Is usually caused by direct injury to the shoulder joint,Leads to calcium deposits within the infraspinatus tendon,Pain is usually felt over the posterior aspect of the shoulder,Usually causes insidious pain with an onset over many weeks,A,Calcific tendonitis is a common disorder of unknown aetiology which results in an acutely painful shoulder joint. In the majority of patients there is no history of trauma. The deposition of calcium within the supraspinatus tendon (seen radiologically) may be part of a degenerative process. Clinical features of this condition include sudden onset of pain with no apparent precipitating cause. On examination the shoulder is tender antero-laterally with some restriction of both active and passive movements. External rotation of the shoulder is however possible thus distinguishing it from frozen shoulder.
motor system,43,Which of the following is within the carpal tunnel?,Abductor pollicis brevis,Abductor pollicis longus,Flexor pollicis brevis,Flexor pollicis longus,Palmaris longus,D,The contents of the carpal tunnel are  The median nerve The four flexor digitorum profundus tendons The four flexor digitorum superficialis tendons Flexor pollicis longus  and their synovium. The abductor pollicis longus lies with extensor pollicis brevis in the most radial (first) dorsal wrist compartment.
motor system,44,A 26‐year‐old female presents with right iliac fossa pain and is taken to theatre for an appendicectomy. An incision is made through the skin and onto muscle with fibres passing superiorly in an oblique direction. Which abdominal wall muscle does this describe?,Rectus abdominis,Pyramidalis,External oblique,Cremaster,Internal oblique,E,The origins of the internal oblique muscles are the∙ Anterior iliac crest∙ Lateral half of the inguinal ligament and∙ Thoraco‐lumbar fascia.Insertion points are the∙ Costal cartilages of ribs 8‐12 and∙ Abdominal aponeurosis of linea alba.The internal oblique is innervated by the∙ 8th‐12th intercostal nerves∙ The iliohypogstric nerve and∙ The ilioinguinal nerve.
motor system,45,"During a neurological examination of the lower limbs, you test the ankle reflex. You hold the foot in external rotation. The knee is flexed. You strike the Achilles tendon with your tendon hammer whilst watching the calf. Which nerve is involved and what is its nerve root?","Deep peroneal nerve L5, S1","Deep peroneal nerve S1, S2","Tibial nerve L5, S1","Tibial nerve S1, S2","Tibial nerve S2, S3",D,"The muscles involved in the ankle reflex are supplied by the tibial nerve which derives from the S1, S2 nerve roots. The tibial nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. The tibial nerve forms in the popliteal fossa. When it leaves the popliteal fossa it runs inferiorly on the tibialis posterior. It supplies the posterior muscles of the leg and knee joint. It terminates by dividing into the medial and lateral plantar nerves."
motor system,46,"Regarding postoperative complications, which of the following is correct?",A sore throat following major surgery is normally due to gastrointestinal reflux,Atelectasis is unusual in the post-operative period,Oxygen therapy should be limited due to the risk of free radical damage,Respiratory depression post-operatively may be due to intraoperative opioids,Swinging pyrexia and bradycardia should alert the possibility of pulmonary embolus (PE),D,"It is not correct that a sore throat following major surgery is normally due to gastrointestinal reflux. It is normally due to tracheal intubation intra-operatively. Atelectasis is not unusual, due to both surgical factors (i.e. abdominal pain) and anaesthetic factors (i.e. intubation and ventilation). It is not true that oxygen therapy should be limited due to the risk of free radical damage. Whilst there are theoretical concerns about free radical damage, ensuring adequate patient oxygenation is the main aim. It is true that respiratory depression post-operatively may be due to intraoperative opioids. Morphine can take up to 40 minutes to have its maximal effect. PE can often be confused with a chest infection as both can feature pyrexia but are associated with a tachycardia."
motor system,47,Which of the following is true concerning scaphoid fractures?,Anterioposterior and lateral radiographs reveal most fractures,Rarely occur in young adults,Should be treated by bone grafting and internal fixation even if undisplaced,When complicated by avascular necrosis the proximal pole is usually affected,Wrist fractures are uncommon,D,Scaphoid fractures are common in young adult males and occur as a result of a fall on an outstretched hand. If complicated by avascular necrosis the proximal pole is usually affected due to the distal to proximal direction of the scaphoid blood supply. Undisplaced fractures can be treated in a plaster. Wrist fractures are common. Initial radiographs usually involve four views of the scaphoid due to difficulties in visualising fractures.
motor system,48,Which of the following is correct regarding non-union of fractures?,A recognised cause is immobility,Characterised by the absence of callus in plain radiography,More common in cancellous bones than in cortical bones,Rarely results from avascular necrosis,Results from inadequate stability of the fracture,E,"Non-union can be said to occur when a fracture fails to heal after less than 3-6 months, depending on the site of the fracture. Non-union is more common in cortical bones than in cancellous bones. The causes of non-union of fracture include:  Inadequate blood supply Avascular necrosis Acute or chronic osteomyelitis Interposition of soft tissue between the fragments Excessive shearing movements or loss of apposition between the fragments Over-distraction of the bony fragments by excessive traction Presence of foreign body or tumour in the fracture site.  Rest, good nutrition, securing the fractured ends in alignment and immobility all help in healing fractures. Plain x ray of non-union of the bone may reveal closure of the medullary cavity, whilst absence of callus at the fracture site suggests delayed union."
motor system,49,Which of the following is most likely to worsen the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome?,Hormone replacement therapy,Ischaemic heart disease,Multiple myeloma,Previous scaphoid fracture,Thyrotoxicosis,C,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is seen most frequently in women between 40 and 60 years of age. Although often there is no obvious predisposing cause, a multitude of conditions have been associated with this syndrome. These include:  Myxoedema (rarely, hyperthyroidism) Rheumatoid arthritis Acromegaly Multiple myeloma Nephrotic syndrome Amyloidosis Diabetes mellitus Pregnancy Gout and pseudogout Lipomas Obesity Menopause Alcoholism, and Wrist fractures (not scaphoid fractures).  Previous fracture of lunate bone could, though rarely, predispose to carpal tunnel compression."
motor system,50,"A 24-year-old teacher falls onto her right (dominant) hand whilst playing netball. She suffers immediate pain and is brought to the Emergency department. On examination, she is particularly tender over the anatomical snuffbox area. An x ray is ordered but no fracture is seen. What is the most likely bone to have been injured?",First metacarpal,Lunate,Radius,Scaphoid,Ulna,D,"The scaphoid can be injured by a fall onto the outstretched hand and is the most likely bone to be injured in someone of this age group. It is uncommon for the fracture line to be seen on the initial x ray. However, a high index of suspicion is needed as the bone can undergo avascular necrosis. This particularly affects the proximal pole of the scaphoid."
motor system,51,Which of the following statements regarding the shoulder joint is correct?,The capsule extends down onto the diaphysis of the anterior aspect of the neck of the humerus,The humeral head is most likely to dislocate posteriorly,The radial nerve may be damaged in dislocation of the shoulder joint,The short tendon of biceps is intracapsular,The subacromial bursa lies between the coracoacromial ligament and the rotator cuff,E,"The shoulder joint capsule extends down onto the diaphysis of the medial aspect of the neck of humerus. Ligaments connect the bones of the shoulder, and tendons join the bones to surrounding muscles. The biceps tendon attaches the biceps muscle to the shoulder and helps to stabilise the joint. The shoulder joint is one of the more commonly dislocated joints of the body. Anterior shoulder dislocation occurs more frequently than posterior dislocation. Four short muscles originate on the scapula and pass around the shoulder where their tendons fuse together to form the rotator cuff. The long, not short, tendon of biceps is intracapsular. Anterior dislocation of the shoulder is a recognised cause of axillary nerve injury."
motor system,52,Which structure is found in the posterior triangle of the neck?,The accessory nerve,The ansa cervicalis,The common carotid artery,The glossopharyngeal nerve,The hypoglossal nerve,A,"The posterior cervical triangle is bounded:  Anteriorly by the posterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle Posteriorly by the anterior border of the trapezius muscle, and Inferiorly by the middle third of the clavicle.  The arteries in the posterior triangle are:  The third part of the subclavian artery The transverse cervical artery The suprascapular artery, and The occipital artery.  The nerves in the posterior triangle include the supraclavicular part of the brachial plexus. Along with the accessory nerve the posterior triangle contains:  The cervical plexus The lesser occipital nerve Great auricular nerve Transverse cervical nerve Supraclavicular nerves, and The phrenic nerve."
motor system,53,Which of the following regarding the forearm and at the wrist is true?,At the wrist the ulnar nerve is lateral to the ulnar artery,In the cubital fossa median nerve is lateral to brachial artery,Median nerve supplies the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus,Scaphoid and lunate articulate with radius,The distal radioulnar joint communicates with the elbow joint,D,"At the level of the wrist the ulnar nerve lies medial to the ulnar artery, both of which pass superficial to the flexor retinaculum. The median nerve is derived from the medial and lateral cords of the brachial plexus. It supplies all the flexors of the forearm with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial half of flexor digitorum profundus (ulnar nerve). The median nerve is the most medial structure in the cubital fossa (followed by bifurcation of brachial artery, biceps tendon, and the radial nerve most laterally). The styloid process of the radius has an inferior articular surface divided by a ridge - the medial part articulating with lunate and the lateral part with scaphoid. The proximal (or superior) radioulnar joint communicates with the elbow joint, unlike the distal radioulnar joint."
motor system,54,Which of the following is true in upper limb neurology?,In carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) sensation is reduced over the thenar eminence,Musculocutaneous nerve is sensory to the upper arm,Radial nerve supplies muscles in the hand,Traction injury of T1 results in a claw hand,Ulnar nerve is sensory to forearm,D,"All the muscles of the hand are supplied by the ulnar nerve, with the exception of the two lateral lumbricals, opponens pollicis, abductor pollicis brevis and flexor pollicis brevis (LOAF) which are all supplied by the median nerve. Sensory loss along the lateral side of the forearm occurs in musculocutaneous nerve injury. The ulnar nerve gives no sensory innervation in the forearm. The ulnar is sensory to the medial third of the hand and medial one and a half fingers. The palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve supplies the thenar eminence and palm. It does not pass through the carpal tunnel so is not affected in carpal tunnel syndrome. A claw hand (small muscles of the hand, Klumpke's paralysis) may occur with an upward traction injury of the brachial plexus which typically affects C8 and T1. See also 'Burner' syndrome (transient brachial plexus symptoms from compression or traction, predominantly in contact sports). The ulnar nerve passes superficial to the flexor retinaculum, hence in CTS function of the hypothenar muscles is preserved."
motor system,55,"A 22-year-old man has had a fall onto his right arm. He has a deformed right upper arm, consistent with a fracture. Which is a recognised complication of humeral fractures?",Anatomical neck - damage to posterior circumflex humeral artery,Medial epicondyle - sensory loss over forearm flexor muscles,Mid shaft - weakness of hypothenar muscles,Mid shaft - wrist drop,Surgical neck - weakness of triceps,D,"Medial epicondyle fractures can cause damage to the ulnar nerve which would result in sensory loss over the anterior and posterior surfaces of the medial third of the hand and medial one and a half fingers. Mid shaft fractures cause damage to the radial nerve (passing in the radial groove of the humerus) resulting in loss of extension of the wrist, that is, wrist drop and a small patch of anaesthesia over the root of the thumb. Fracture of the surgical neck of humerus damages the circumflex humeral arteries (anterior and posterior branches) in addition to the axillary nerve which causes paralysis of the deltoid and teres minor, with sensory loss over the lower part of the deltoid (regimental badge distribution)."
motor system,56,Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) occurs in which of the following ?,Addison's disease,Osteoarthritis,Pernicious anaemia,Sarcoidosis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,E,"The other systemic causes of avasular necrosis are:  Scleroderma Infective endocarditis Alcoholism Extensive burns Radiation Diabetes mellitus Steroid therapy (for example, following renal transplantation) Cushing's disease, and Gaucher's disease.  The local causes which predispose to this condition include:  Rheumatoid arthritis (affecting that particular bone) Trauma (as in fracture neck of femur; fractures of the scaphiod) Severe osteoarthritis, and Psoriatic arthropathy."
motor system,57,Which of the following is true in cervical spine trauma with an associated injury to the spinal cord?,Autonomic hyper-reflexia occurs in 25% of quadriplegics,Autoregulation of spinal cord blood flow will protect against moderate hypotension,Hypotension should be treated with a rapid infusion of 1 litre of colloid,Steroids administered in the first 48 hours after injury have proven benefit,Suxamethonium can be used during the first 72 hours following injury,E,"Autonomic hyperreflexia is seen in 85% of quadriplegics and can develop days to weeks after a cervical spine injury. It is characterised by hypertension and arrhythmias, with cutaneous vasodilatation above and vasoconstriction below the level of the cord injury. Autoregulation of blood flow to the spinal cord is the same as for the rest of the central nervous system, and is similarly abolished by trauma. The spinal cord perfusion pressure is the difference between the mean arterial pressure and the cerebrospinal fluid pressure. It has been concluded recently, on level 1 evidence, that high dose steroids in the first 24-48 hours after injury have no benefit and are more likely to be harmful. Suxamethonium can be used safely up to 72 hours following spinal cord injury. Hyperkalaemia and cardiac arrest can occur beyond 72 hours, due to the increased potassium efflux and this effect lasts for up to 12 months, or until full recovery has occurred."
motor system,58,"An 83-year-old lady has been gardening on a sunny bank holiday when she slips on her garden path, falling onto her outstretched left hand. She hears a 'crack' and due to severe pain attends her local Emergency department. An x ray shows what the casualty officer thinks to be a Colles' fracture. Which options describes the fracture displacement seen in a Colles' fracture?",Displaced and angulated dorsally and radially,Displaced and angulated dorsally and ulnarwards,Displaced and angulated in a volar and radial direction,Displaced and angulated in a volar and ulnar direction,Displaced and volar fracture with an intra-articular fracture,A,"The Colles' fracture was first described by Abraham Collins, a Dublin surgeon, in 1814. He described a 'dinner fork' deformity of the distal radius. A plain film x ray will show a fracture which is displaced and angulated in a dorsal and radial direction. A radial fracture with volar displacement of the distal fragments is called a Smith's fracture and is usually caused by a backward fall on the back of the outstretched hand. The other type of eponymous named wrist fracture is called a Barton's fracture, which is a intra-articular fracture of the distal radius with dislocation of the radio-carpel joint."
motor system,59,Which of the following is true concerning compartment syndrome?,Can lead to Volkmann's ischaemic contracture,Is ruled out by the presence of peripheral pulses,Patients should undergo fasciotomy when the compartment pressure equals the diastolic pressure,Resulting in impaired function of motor nerves suggests that the ischaemia is early,Signs are elicited by active stretch of the suspected muscle group,A,"Compartment syndrome is a devastating early complication usually seen after fractures, which must be recognised and treated early. A rise in compartmental tissue pressure may be triggered by a number of factors, including soft tissue injury. If a sustained rise in tissue pressure above the arterial perfusion pressure occurs, muscles and nerves will be deprived of essential blood supply and ischaemic muscle further releases factors (such as free radicals) which increase capillary permeability, worsening the situation. The main early feature is excessive pain which is made worse by passive stretch of the suspected group of muscles. Compartment syndrome can occur in the presence of normal peripheral pulses, since it is the microvasculature which is initially affected. Sensory loss may be detected early but motor weakness is a late sign. Fasciotomy should be undertaken if the difference between the diastolic and the measured compartment pressure is less than 30 mmHg. If not recognised and treated early, it could lead to Volkmann's ischaemic contracture."
motor system,60,What is the boundary between the true and false pelvis?,Vagina,Pelvic Brim,Pelvic outlet,Sacrospinous ligament,Sacrotuberous ligament,B,As can be seen the false pelvis is the part above the pelvic brim. The vagina divides the pelvis into anterior and posterior compartments
motor system,61,Which of the following is a radiological feature of avascular necrosis?,Intra-articular calcification,Juxta-articular osteoporosis,Osteochondral fragments,Osteoporosis,Widening of joint surface,C,"Avascular necrosis can occur after fractures or as a result of caisson or sickle cell disease. Sites that have a poor blood supply, such as the femoral head, the scaphoid and the lunate bones, appear to be particularly susceptible. The arterial supply or venous drainage may be cut off or the capillaries may become occluded. The bone dies and then repairs if the blood supply is restored. The condition causes pain and loss of movement. The radiographic features include:  Alternating regions of bone lucency and sclerosis Joint surface collapse, and Osteochondral fragments.  Juxta-articular osteoporosis is a feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Intra-articular calcification and peri-articular calcification, classically in the menisci and the intervertebral discs, is a feature of pseudogout."
motor system,62,A diagnosis of prolapsed intervertebral disc would be supported by which of the following?,Bilateral symmetrical nerve involvement,Compressions of a single nerve root,No evidence of nerve compression,Pain which is unremitting in character,Pain which is worse on resting,B,"A diagnosis of a prolapsed intervertebral disc would be supported by clinical findings of compression of a single nerve root. If more than one root is involved, then the diagnosis is less likely. Pain, which is unremitting in character, indicates another cause. Pain, which is worse on resting, indicates another cause, such as infection, tumour or metabolic disease."

Which type is the manubriosternal joint ?,A double synovial joint,A fibrous joint,A primary cartilaginous joint,A single synovial joint,A symphysis,E,"The manubriosternal joint is a symphysis or secondary cartilaginous joint. Both articular surfaces are covered with hyaline cartilage and united by fibrocartilage. A double synovial joint has two separate synovial cavities, one above the other. These are separated by an articular disk that's flexible and highly movable. i.e the Tempromandibular joint. A fibrous joint is connected by fibrous tissue, consisting mainly of collagen and the joints are fixed. A primary cartilaginous joint is where two bones are joined by hyaline cartilage.  A single synovial joint is where bones are surrounded by a fibrous joint capsule that is continuous with the periosteum of the joined bones and contains synovial fluid."

motor system,67,Which of the following is true of flexor tenosynovitis?,Can lead to destruction of synovial gliding surfaces,Causes partially extended posture of the finger,Is usually treated with plaster of paris casting,Minor infections may lead to tendon necrosis,Results from penetrating wounds and Escherichia coli infections,A,"Infections of the finger flexor tendons are serious with the potential for substantial permanent functional impairment. The majority of these infections result from penetrating wounds and Stapylococcus aureus infection. The four cardinal signs of tendon sheath infection are:  Partially flexed posture of the finger Fusiform swelling of the finger Tenderness along the entire flexor tendon sheath, and Severe pain from passive extension of the finger.  The tenosynovitis can rapidly destroy the synovial gliding surfaces and result in healing with restrictive adhesions. A fulminating infection can cause tendon necrosis. Early tenosynovitis can be treated with intravenous antibiotics, elevation and splinting. However, if no definite signs of improvement are seen after 24 hours, surgical exploration of drainage must be considered since the consequences of a fulminating flexor tenosynovitis are so severe and permanent."
motor system,68,A 26‐year‐old female presents with right iliac fossa pain and is taken to theatre for an appendicectomy. An incision is made through the skin and onto muscle with fibres passing inferiorly in an oblique direction. Which abdominal wall muscle does this describe?,Internal oblique,Pyramidalis,Tranversus abdominis,Rectus abdominis,External oblique,E,The fibres of the external oblique muscle run anteriorly and inferiorly. It originates from the external surfaces of ribs 5‐12. Its insertion points are the anterior iliac crest and abdominal aponeurosis to linea alba.

Sensory impairment following ulnar nerve damage is over the little finger and half the ring finger as well as the ulnar border of the hand. If the ulnar nerve is damaged at or just below the elbow there is wasting of most of the small muscles of the hand except opponens pollicis and abductor pollicis brevis (both supplied by the median nerve). The median nerve supplies lumbricals I and II, with the ulnar nerve supplying lumbricals III and IV as well as the interossei. The median nerve is used for the thumb component of apposition of thumb and index finger. If this nerve is compressed, as in carpal tunnel syndrome, wasting of the thenar eminence will occur."

This causes hypoxia and cardiopulmonary compromise. A tension pneumothorax results in:  deviation of the trachea away from the side decreased venous return causing an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP) or distended neck veins hyper-resonance to percussion, and decreased breath sounds.  Pulsus paradoxus occurs in asthma and cardiac tamponade. The first line of treatment is to place a needle into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line."

You are called to see him some hours later because of unbearable pain in his leg. You use a manometer to measure the pressures in his muscle compartments and the reading in the extensor compartment is 40 mmHg. He is taken to theatre for emergency fasciotomy. Which of the following would you encounter in the extensor compartment?,Deep peroneal nerve,Peroneus brevis,Peroneus longus,Sural nerve,Tibial nerve,A,"The contents of the extensor compartment are:  The deep peroneal nerve The anterior tibial artery, and Four muscles (tibialis anterior, extensor hallucis longus, extensor digitorum longus and peroneus tertius).  The sural and tibial nerves are found in the posterior compartment and peroneus brevis and longus in the lateral compartment."
motor system,72,Which of the following is true of Crush syndrome?,Is also referred to as traumatic squeeze,Sensory and motor function is preserved in the compressed limbs,"Serum creatinine, potassium and phosphate are elevated",The serum calcium level is usually elevated,The urine is clear,C,"'Crush syndrome' may also be referred to as traumatic rhabdomyolysis. The sustained crushing of a significant muscle mass causes impaired perfusion and therefore ischaemia of the muscle. Damaged muscle cells release myoglobin (an assay should be used to confirm its presence) and potassium, causing hyperkalaemia. Myoglobin can induce renal failure, therefore making intravenous fluid resuscitation critical. Alkalisation of urine with sodium bicarbonate reduces tubular precipitation of myoglobin and may be used in treatment. Other toxic metabolites released from damaged muscle cells may affect the myocardium leading to a reduced cardiac output and shock. The diagnostic criteria for crush syndrome are:  crushing injury to a large mass of skeletal muscle sensory and motor disturbances in the compressed limbs, which subsequently become tense and swollen myoglobinuria and/or haematuria peak creatine kinase (CK) greater than1000 U/L.  Renal problems are common with one of the following characteristics:  Oliguria (urine output less than400 ml/24 hr) Elevated levels of blood urea, creatinine, uric acid, potassium, phosphate, or decreased calcium.

motor system,73,"A 23-year-old electrician presents to the Emergency department with a deep cut to his right distal forearm from a broken glass after he was involved in a fight at a nightclub. On examination, he is unable to pinch by adducting his thumb or spread his fingers. His grip is weak. He also has loss of sensation over his little and ring fingers. Which nerve is the most likely to have been damaged?",Anterior interosseous nerve,Median nerve,Posterior interosseous nerve,Radial nerve,Ulnar nerve,E,"This patient is mostly likely to have an ulnar nerve injury. Injury to the ulnar nerve at the level of the wrist produces hypothenar wasting and clawing of the hand, due to unopposed action of the long flexors. There is loss of sensation over the little and ring fingers. Finger abduction is weak and the loss of thumb adduction makes pinch difficult. This is due to paralysis of the adductor pollicis and the first palmar interossei causing flexion of the thumb (due to flexor pollicis longus) when the patient is asked to grasp a card between his thumb and index finger (Froment's sign)."
motor system,74,"An 87-year-old lady is admitted to the orthopaedic ward following a fall in which she sustained a fractured neck of the femur. She has no past medical or surgical history. She undergoes hemiarthroplasty and on her second post-operative day she is noted to have a warm, red wound and is started on an intravenous cephalosporin. This is continued for 12 days following which she develops abdominal distension and profuse diarrhoea. Plain abdominal x ray shows a dilated large bowel. Rigid sigmoidoscopy shows an inflamed rectal mucosa with pseudomembranous patches. What is the most useful next investigation?",Barium enema,Colonoscopy,CT abdomen/pelvis,Gastrograffin enema,Stool sample analysis,E,"The clinical, radiological and endoscopic features are suggestive of colitis, and with the history of prolonged broad-spectrum antibiotic use, Clostridium difficile pseudomembranous colitis needs to be excluded. This can be achieved by examination of the stool for C. difficile toxins (and culture in case it is not C. diffiicile causing her diarrhoea). Barium enema, gastrograffin enema and CT have no role in diagnosis this condition. Colonoscopy could be considered if rigid sigmoidoscopy had been normal and C. difficile toxins had been negative, although it would carry a risk of perforation."

Plain x rays of the hip are extremely useful in establishing the diagnosis. MRI and contrast MRI in the early stages, will give far more detail of necrosis, revascularisation and healing than plain x rays. A nuclear scan will provide less detail and exposes the child to radiation although a technetium 99 bone scan is helpful in delineating the extent of avascular changes before they are evident on plain radiographs.

motor system,76,Whilst examining the abdomen of a 21‐year‐old female with abdominal pain you notice a well‐ defined 'six‐pack'. Which abdominal wall muscle does this describe?,Internal oblique,Rectus abdominis,External oblique,Cremaster,Pyramidalis,B,The rectus abdominis are a pair of muscles which run from the bottom of the costal cartilages to the pubic symphysis. Three tendinous insertions firmly attach the anterior rectus sheath wall to the muscle. This muscle produces a 'six pack' appearance in athletic individuals.The rectus abdominis origins are the pubic crest and symphysis pubis. Its insertion points are the costal cartilages of ribs five to seven and xiphoid process of sternum. The muscles are innervated by the 7th‐12th intercostal nerves.

Which finding suggests injury to the femoral nerve?,Loss of knee reflex,Loss of sensation over lateral aspect of thigh,Weakness of abduction of the hip,Weakness of adduction at the hip,Weakness of knee flexion,A,"A lesion of the femoral nerve (L234) is characterised by weakness of the quadriceps femoris muscle and hence weakness of extension of the knee, loss of sensation over the front of the thigh and loss of the knee jerk. The lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh (L1,2) supplies the skin on the lateral aspect of the thigh and knee (plus the lower lateral quadrant of the buttock). The obturator nerve (L2-4), which supplies adductors of the hip and, supplies sensation to the inner part of the thigh."

She reports severe abdominal pain and in the last 12 hours she has been unable to micturate. Rectal examination reveals an empty rectum and altered peri-anal sensation. Neurological examination of her limbs reveals weakness in both legs but upper limbs are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Central disc prolapse at C6/7,Central disc prolapse at L4/5,Constipation,Lateral disc prolapse at C6/7,Multiple sclerosis,B,"This lady has symptoms and signs of a cauda equina compression - she cannot micturate, has weak legs and altered peri-anal sensation. Lateral disc prolapse would cause severe pain in the affected limb. Multiple sclerosis can cause neurological symptoms but given this lady's previous back pain, a disc problem is much more likely. Constipation would not cause neurological signs. A problem at the cervical level would cause symptoms in the upper limbs."

You place your hand under the knee, then strike the knee just below the patella whilst you watch the quadriceps muscle. What nerve roots and nerve are involved in this reflex?","Femoral nerve L2, L3","Femoral nerve L3, L4","Sciatic nerve L2, L3","Sciatic nerve L3, L4","Sciatic nerve L4, L5",B,"The quadriceps muscle is innervated via the femoral nerve (L3, L4 nerve roots) and it is this that is involved in the knee reflex. The femoral nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus (L2-L4). It forms in the abdomen within psoas major. It then descends and can be found at the midpoint of the inguinal ligament. It enters the femoral triangle lateral to the femoral artery and vein. It supplies the anterior thigh muscles, sends articular branches to the hip and knee joints, and supplies an area of skin on the anterior thigh (and part of medial thigh not supplied by the obturator nerve: medial and intermediate nerves of the thigh)."

A useful acronym for remembering the order of ossification is CRITOL:  Capitellum Radial head epiphysis Internal epicondyle Trochlea Olecranon Lateral epicondyle  If an apparent trochlear ossification centre is present, the internal epicondylar ossification centre of the humerus should always be visible radiographically. In the cases of absence of an internal epicondylar ossification centre, but presence of the trochlear ossification centre, the child will have avulsed the internal epicondylar epiphysis. "
motor system,81,Which of the following statements is true regarding neck of femur fracture?,Extracapsular fractures have a higher incidence of avascular necrosis compared to intracapsular fractures,Displaced fractures should be surgically corrected urgently,Internal rotation of the affected limb is a common clinical finding,Mortality for elderly patients is greater than80% at one year,Non-union is not a complication,B,"Intracapsular femoral fractures are at increased risk of avascular necrosis due to disruption of the capsular blood supply at the time of injury. In young patients the fracture should be reduced and fixed early to decrease the risks of avascular necrosis and non-union, often in the form of a total hip replacement. Whereas in elderly patient a hemi-arthroplasty may be more appropriate for intracapsular fractures. Patients more commonly present with a short, externally rotated limb. Mortality at one year is approximately 25%. Non-union occurs in up to 10-30% of neck of femur fractures, the highest risk associated with intracapsular fractures."

On examination, he is unable to initiate abduction of this shoulder. However, if the arm is lifted to 90 degrees, he is able to hold it in that position. There is tenderness under the acromion process. Choose the most appropriate diagnosis.",Acromioclavicular joint disruption,Anterior dislocation of the shoulder,Rupture of the long head of biceps,Supraspinatus tendinitis,Torn supraspinatus tendon,E,"Tear of the supraspinatus tendon is common in elderly patients (the most commonly damaged tendon in rotator cuff tears). With advancing age the tendinous cuff of the shoulder degenerates and is liable to rupture if subjected to sudden movement or stress. Major tear in the tendon leads to a loss of action of the supraspinatus muscle (tendon). The patient is unable to initiate shoulder abduction, as the early phase of abduction requires the action of the supraspinatus muscle. However, the patient may be able to hold the arm in the abducted position (after passive abduction), since this is supported by the action of the deltoid."
motor system,83,Which of the following is true of fracture of the scaphoid bone?,Is commonly complicated by avascular necrosis of the distal pole,Is the most common fracture of the carpal bones,Is usually diagnosed on plain x ray of the wrist (scaphoid views),Resulting in non-union; can be treated effectively in a plaster of Paris cast for 12 weeks,Results in osteoarthritis soon after injury,B,"The scaphoid is the most frequently fractured of the carpal bones, accounting for approximately 80% of all carpal bone fractures. This fracture which is notoriously easy to miss results from a fall on the hand (usually outstretched). The classical signs of scaphoid fracture are:  Swelling Pain on wrist movements, and Tenderness on direct pressure 2 cm distal to Lister's tubercle of the radius (in the anatomical snuff box) and on proximal pressure on the extended thumb or index finger.  Initial x rays rarely pick up the fracture. If x rays are negative and scaphoid fracture a strong possibility, treatment in a plaster cast for two weeks followed by repeat x ray is recommended, by which time the fracture may be visible. If the x ray is still inconclusive, a bone scan is a good investigation. Non-union varies from 20-50% depending on the fracture pattern. In such instances, a bone graft or Herbert screw fixation is indicated. The major blood supply (nutrient artery) enters the scaphoid from the distal pole; therefore avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment is a serious complication. Degeneration of the wrist and early osteoarthritis are recognised complications of scaphoid fractures."

motor system,85,Which of the following is true of the shoulder joint?,Subscapularis bursa lies deep to the coraco-acromial ligament,The axillary nerve passes with the posterior circumflex humeral artery around the surgical neck of the humerus,The long head of biceps is extracapsular and extrasynovial,The cephalic vein passes upwards beneath the clavipectoral fascia,The long head of biceps arises from the apex of the coracoid process,B,"It is the subacromial bursa that lies directly deep to coraco-acromial ligament. The bursa reduces friction between the supraspinatus tendon and the acromion. Degenerative change in the bursa is followed by degenerative change in the tendon and can lead to subacromial bursitis. The long head of biceps arises from the supraglenoid tubercle the short head from the coracoid process of the scapula. Biceps inserts into the posterior border of the tuberosity of the radius. The tendon of the long head of biceps crosses the humeral head within capsule of the shoulder joint. The superficial veins of the hand drain laterally into the cephalic vein (medially into basilic vein) which crosses the anatomical snuff box, ascends the arm superficially and laterally to biceps and ends by piercing the clavipectoral fascia. The axillary nerve passes with the posterior circumflex humeral artery around the surgical neck of humerus, and as such, is susceptible to injury in a fracture of the surgical neck."

A patient who is asleep does not therefore have a GCS of 3 as this is not their best possible response.
motor system,87,"In acute septic arthritis, which statement is true?",Around 50% of cases involve more than one joint,Intravenous antibiotics are usually effective in treating this condition,Joint flexion is more restricted than rotation,Staphylococci and Haemophilus influenzae are the commonest causative organisms,The infection usually starts in the synovial membrane and then leads to progressive destructive of the articular cartilage,E,"Most cases of acute septic arthritis are through the bloodstream (haematogenous). Septic arthritis can also occur from direct infection from a wound, an injection into a joint or an operative procedure on the joint (for example, arthroscopy). Joints can also be infected by spread from acute osteomyelitis. Staphlococcus aureus is the most common causative organism. Since the introduction of childhood Hib vaccine the incidence of H. influenzae causing septic arthritis has markedly reduced. Some 10% of infections are gram negative (Pseudomonas spp. and Escherichia coli). The joint is the site of maximum tenderness; it may be swollen and the overlying skin may be red and tender. All the joint movements are severely restricted. The most commonly affected joints are knees and hips (hips in children) followed by shoulder and ankle. From 80-90% are monoarticular. The infection usually starts in the vascular synovial membrane, and seropurulent exudates develop in the synovial fluid. The articular cartilage is progressively destroyed and vascular damage may lead to death of the epiphyseal bone. At this stage infection may spread to the diaphysis or into the overlying tissues to form an abscess which may eventually drain onto the skin through one or more sinuses. The differential diagnoses of this condition include:  Acute osteomyelitis Traumatic synovitis Haemarthosis Acute rheumatic fever Rheumatoid arthritis Gout, and Pseudogout.  The white cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are usually raised. The treatment is by joint aspiration supplemented by antibiotics and analgesia. Formal open drainage may also be required. The final result may be resolution, but secondary osteoarthritis and avascular bone necrosis are common sequelae. Bony ankylosis and permanent deformity develop when the articular destruction is severe."

On examination, you find that his trachea is deviated and he has no breath sounds on the right hand side. What is the next step in your management?",Call for senior help,Chest drain insertion,Fluid bolus challenge,Immediate chest x ray,Needle decompression,E,The patient is displaying signs of a tension pneumothorax. This requires immediate treatment without delay. The patient should have a needle inserted into the second intercostal space in the midclavicular line. This is a clinical diagnosis and the treatment should take place before a chest x ray is taken.
motor system,89,In which of the following is the risk of fractures due to osteoporosis increased?,Addison's disease,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Myxoedema,Osteoarthritis,Premature menopause,E,"Osteoporosis is caused due to a reduction in bone mass (osteopenia) for the patient's age and sex, and there is usually a negative calcium balance. In later life osteoporosis can cause fractures, even after trivial trauma. The bone is fully mineralised but it is porous and weak. The condition affects at least a quarter of all women over the age of 60 years and is usually associated with postmenopausal changes.Caucasian women with a premature menopause (and amenorrhoea) and a familial tendency are more likely to develop osteoporosis. The other risk factors include:  Endocrine diseases such as thyrotoxicosis Diabetes mellitus Cushing's syndrome Hyperparathyroidism and hypopituitarism Malabsorption Primary biliary cirrhosis Rheumatoid arthritis Prolonged bed rest Past low-trauma fractures, and Mastocytosis."
motor system,90,Which of the following is true of carpal tunnel syndrome?,Is most commonly symptomatic at night,Tinel's sign is more reliable than Phalen's test,Results in loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the palm,Results in tingling and pain in the ring and little fingers,Results in wasting of the hypothenar eminence,A,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is more common after repetitive actions and presents most commonly as the cause of hand pain at night. It is due to compression of the median nerve as it passes under the flexor retinaculum. When the pain is at its worst the patient characteristically flicks (flick test - not very reliable) or shakes the wrist to bring about relief. Clinical features are of median nerve distribution, such as wasting of the thenar eminence and decreased sensation over the palm (two point discrimination test - should distinguish at 0.5 cm). Please note that lateral palmar sensation is spared as it is supplied by the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve which does not pass through the tunnel. Phalen's test (George Phalen 1966: holding the wrist hyperflexed for one minute) reproduces the symptoms with a sensitivity and specificity of up to 85% and 90% respectively (other figures quoted are 70% positive in confirmed carpel tunnel syndrome and 30% false positive in those without proven carpel tunnel syndrome {nerve conduction studies}). This is more reliable than Tinel's test which involves tapping over the tunnel to produce paraesthesia over the area of median nerve distribution in the palm. For this test the sensitivity and specificity are up to 67% and 68% respectively. However, it is probably not this reliable. Sceptics have said it is 50% positive and 50% false positive so you might as well toss a coin instead."
motor system,91,Which of the following is true of congenital torticollis?,Appears after the third month of birth,Facial asymmetry is a common presentation,Physiotherapy is ineffective in the early stages,The ear is nearer the shoulder on the normal side,Tilt and rotation of the head to the same side of swelling,B,"Congenital torticollis develops as a result of birth injury to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It can present from the second week of birth, as a swelling within the sternocleidomastoid muscle. Once the swelling subsides, there is subsequent fibrosis resulting in a tilt of the head towards the affected side, and rotation of the neck to the opposite side. Therefore, the ear on the affected side is nearer to the shoulder. Thus, congenital torticollis causes the head to tilt downwards, towards the affected side, and the face to turn away from the affected side^1. These are the normal actions of contraction of the muscle. Facial asymmetry is a common clinical presentation of the condition. In the early stages physiotherapy to lengthen the muscle is beneficial. If the condition persists, surgical treatment in the form of division and release of the muscle at its lower end may be required. "

motor system,93,An 85-year-old woman has had recurrent falls and now has a fracture of the distal ulna. Which statement is correct?,Bone fractures attributable to vitamin D deficiency have normal bone density,Low vitamin D levels are always associated with muscle weakness,Toxic levels of Vitamin D occur at approximately twice the therapeutic dose,Vitamin D deficiency in the elderly is rare,Vitamin D replacement reduces the incidence of fractures in the elderly,E,"Vitamin D deficiency in the elderly is more common than often thought, especially in the housebound and those in residential and nursing homes, with an overall frequency of 17% in women aged 85 and over. Reduced levels of 25(OH)D lead to elevated parathyroid hormone , which results in increased mobilization of calcium from the bone and therefore decreased mineralisation. Vitamin D deficiency is also associated with muscle weakness, as well as osteomalacia, and the risk of fracture among elderly people with vitamin D deficiency are increased by falls secondary to muscle weakness. Vitamin D replacement (800 IU daily) with calcium, has been shown to reduce falls and fractures by 47% compared with controls who received calcium only. The correct dose of vitamin D replacement should be 800 IU. Lowest doses at which adverse events have been observed with Vitamin D replacement are 200 nmol/L, which equates to a daily dose of 40,000 IU. "

They are most commonly seen around the knee and in the proximal humerus. They often occur in young adults, but are also seen in the elderly in association with Paget's disease. They usually present as bone pain and a palpable lump. An x ray will show periosteal elevation (Codman's triangle) and a 'sunburst' appearance due to soft tissue involvement.

motor system,97,Shoulder abduction mainly depends on the integrity of which one of the following?,Axillary nerve,Coracobrachialis muscle,Middle trunk of brachial plexus,Teres major muscle,Thoracodorsal nerve,A,"Shoulder abduction is initiated by supraspinatus (supplied by suprascapular nerve C5, 6, that is, upper trunk of brachial plexus) which serves to hold the head of the humerus against the glenoid cavity during the movement. Deltoid is the principal abductor of the shoulder (supplied by the axillary nerve C5,6). Subscapularis, infraspinatus and teres minor produce a downward pull on the head of the humerus against the pull of deltoid. These muscles prevent the deltoid pulling the humerus upwards. Teres major and subscapularis produce medial rotation. Infraspinatus and teres minor produce lateral rotation. Coracobrachialis is a weak flexor and adductor of the shoulder. The thoracodorsal nerve supplies latissimus dorsi and hence is not involved in shoulder abduction."

This has been successfully manipulated back into joint in the Emergency department. Since then his arm has been in a broad arm sling. When you examine him in the fracture clinic he is unable to abduct his shoulder and there is a numb patch over the lateral side of his arm. Which nerve has been affected?,Axillary nerve,Musculocutaneous nerve,Nerve to subscapularis,Radial nerve,Upper cord of brachial plexus,A,"Common mechanisms of axillary nerve injury are:  Following anterior dislocation of the shoulder Proximal fracture of the humerus, or Injury during intramuscular injections into the deltoid muscle.  Injury to the axillary nerve will lead to paralsysis of the deltoid muscle which means that shoulder abduction will be virtually absent. There is also loss of sensation over an area of the upper limb which is also known as the 'regimental badge' area. The deltoid muscle arises from the lateral third of the clavicle, the acromion and the spine of the scapula. It attaches into the deltoid tuberosity of the humerus."
motor system,99,Which one of the following regarding congenital dislocation of the hip is true?,A family history is frequently found,Polyhydramnios,The incidence is 2.5 to 20 per 1000 live births,The male:female ratio is 2:1,The Ortolani-Barlow manoeuvre is highly sensitive and specific,C,"The incidence of unstable hips at birth is approximately 2%, of which 90% are dislocatable, and 10% dislocated. There is a 6:1 female to male ratio and there may be a family history. It is more common in first children, breech presentations (50% of infants with congenital dislocation of the hip), oligohydraminos, and may be associated with other deformities such as talipes. The Ortolani manoeuvre detects a dislocated hip, as the hip is 'clunked' back into position. Barlow's test detects a dislocatable hip by pressing posteriorly and internally rotating it, the hip can be dislocated. The introduction of routine testing of the hips has not decreased the incidence of established dislocation. This may be because of poor examination technique, a hip that becomes unstable only when weight bearing begins, or an acquired dislocation with age. Late presentation of congenital dislocation of the hip may include asymmetry of skin folds, limited abduction of hips, shortening of the thigh, with knees at different levels when the patient is supine and the legs are flexed (Galeazzi sign), and limping."

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid ,de Quervain's tenosynovitis,Osteoarthritis ,Psoriatic arthritis ,Rheumatoid ,C,"Osteoarthritis of the first carpometacarpal joint is extremely common and in a 68-year-old lady is the most likely diagnosis. Swelling is usually bony hard and due to osteophyte formation which can lead to the appearance of squaring of the hand. de Quervain's tenosynovitis is a common overuse condition which presents with pain at the base of the thumb but is not associated with joint swelling. This joint can be affected in rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis but rarely on its own. Scaphoid fractures are most usually seen in young, healthy individuals. Avascular necrosis is reported to occur in between 13 and 50%; most frequently if the proximal scaphoid is injured."

Its boundaries are:  Anteriorly - inguinal ligament Medially - lacunar ligament Laterally - medial border of femoral vein Posteriorly - pectineal ligament and pectineus muscle.  It is not lined by peritoneum. The contents of the femoral ring are Cloquet's node and lymphatics. The femoral ring is the main site for a femoral hernia where the lining of the hernia would be peritoneum.

The principal function of biceps brachii is supination of the forearm, and flexion of the elbow joint (it is also a weak flexor of the shoulder joint). Mid humeral fractures can damage the radial nerve. The brachial artery is easily palpable in the antecubital fossa, lying just medial to the biceps tendon. The profunda brachii artery (also known as andquot;deep artery of the armandquot; and andquot;deep branchial arteryandquot;) arises just below the lower border of teres major. The brachial artery arises as a continuation of the axillary artery at the lower border of the teres major, which is distal to the surgical neck of humerus."
motor system,104,Which muscle of the lower limb is primarily responsible for ankle dorsiflexion?,Peroneus longus,Iliopsoas,Tibialis anterior,Extensor hallucis longus,Quadriceps,C,The tibialis anterior muscle is located most medially in the anterior compartment of the leg.It is responsible for dorsiflexion and inversion of the foot. The tibialis muscle also functions to stabilise the ankle as the foot hits the ground during the contact phase of walking and later pulls the foot off the ground during the swing phase.

What would be the most appropriate action?,Admit to paediatric ITU,Discharge after warning the parents that your suspicions about possible child abuse have been aroused,Discharge and arrange an appointment at the next paediatric clinic,Discharge and notify the duty social worker,Perform a skeletal survey,E,"This scenario is a worrying one and should be considered to be a non-accidental injury until proven otherwise. Appropriate action in this case should be to admit the baby to hospital for careful evaluation. A detailed history should be taken, ideally from more than one person. It would be important to ask further questions about why a baby of 6 months was sitting on a chair without support (the history and method of injury does not fit with the developmental age of the child). A full examination of the child should be carried out with careful documentation of any injuries. Investigations need to be arranged including a full skeletal survey, blood tests including a bone profile and consideration of neuro-imaging of the brain. As part of the overall investigation, social services need to be informed. There needs to be careful inter-agency discussions between health professionals and social services. A discharge plan needs to be formulated after a case conference and follow up should be arranged."
motor system,107,Which muscle is associated with ulnar neuropathy?,Lateral lumbricals,opponens pollicis,Flexor pollicis longus,Flexor pollicis brevis,Adductor pollicis,E,"The ulnar nerve supplies the hypothenar muscles (opponens digiti minimi, abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi), dorsal interossei, the lateral lumbrical muscles, palmar interossei and the adductor pollicis."
motor system,108,Which one of the above statements about the female pelvis is correct?,The cavity of the female pelvis is deeper than that of the male pelvis,The sacrum is wider in the female pelvis than in the male pelvis,The sciatic notches are narrower in the female pelvis than in the male pelvis,The sacrum is longer in the female pelvis than the male pelvis,The ischial spines are more prominent in the female pelvis than in male pelvis,B,"Differences between the Male and Female Pelvis?The female pelvis:• Less massive• The anterior iliac spines more widely separated - greater lateral prominence of the hips.• Wider pelvic inlet - both antero-posterior and transverse diameters• Pelvic inlet more circular• More shallow• The sacrum is shorter wider, and its upper part is less curved• The obturator foramina are triangular in shape and smaller in size• The outlet is larger and the coccyx more movable.• The sciatic notches are wider and shallower• The ischial spines are less prominent.• The pubic symphysis is less deep, and the pubic arch is wider and more rounded than in the male"
motor system,109,An 18-year-old woman falls onto her outstretched hand whilst under the influence of alcohol. She attends her local emergency department where she complains of severe pain in the right forearm. An x ray reveals a radius shaft fracture with dislocation of distal radioulnar joint. This type of fracture dislocation is named after which surgeon?,Barton,Colles,Galeazzi,Monteggia,Smith,C,The description is of a Galeazzi fracture-dislocation. The Monteggia fracture-dislocation is of the ulna with disruption of the proximal joint. The other three fractures named are of the distal radius. 
motor system,110,A 35-year-old PE teacher has pain on the lateral side of his right elbow that radiates to the forearm. He is tender over the lateral aspect of his right elbow. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,De Quervain’s tenosynovitis,Golfer’s elbow,Olecrannon bursitis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Tennis elbow,E,The presentation is that of 'tennis elbow' (lateral epicondylitis). It is thought to be due to the overuse of the extensor carpi radialis brevis. Medial epicondylitis is known as 'golfer's elbow'. Olecrannon bursitis is due to inflammation of the olecrannon bursae. De Quervain's tenosynovitis affects the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus and is characterised by pain around the base of the thumb.
motor system,111,Which of the following is true regarding the femoral nerve?,Has a branch which supplies the skin of the scrotum,Lies medial to the femoral vein,Lies within the femoral sheath,May supply part of the foot,Shares its origin with the sciatic nerve,D,"The femoral sheath contains the femoral artery and vein as well as lymphatics, but not the nerve. The femoral nerve lies behind and lateral to the femoral sheath. The femoral nerve gives off three cutaneous branches:  Two from its anterior division (medial and intermediate cutaneous nerves of thigh, which supply the skin of the medial and anterior surfaces of the thigh) One from its posterior division (saphenous nerve).  It has no branches to the scrotum. The saphenous nerve runs down the medial side of the leg and supplies the medial side of the calf as far as the medial malleolus. It terminates in the region of the ball of the big toe, and may supply the medial side of the dorsum of the foot. The femoral nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus, and comes from the same lumbar nerves as the obturator nerve, L2, L3 and L4."
motor system,112,"Regarding carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), which statement is correct?",An underlying medical condition is usually present,Is associated with fasciculation of the small muscles of the hand,Is exacerbated by coughing and sneezing,Is uncommon in diffuse eosinophilic fasciitis,The pain may radiate up the forearm,E,"CTS is associated with conditions such as hypothyroidism, acromegaly and obesity, but the vast majority of cases are idiopathic. Typical symptoms include nocturnal pain in the hand that may radiate up the forearm. "
motor system,113,"Concerning the shoulder joint, which one of the following is correct?",Posterior dislocation of the shoulder joint is the most common dislocation of this joint,Injury to the nerve related to the surgical neck of the humerus may paralyse the teres minor muscle,The capsule is poorly supported superiorly,The subacromial bursa communicates with the shoulder joint cavity,The triceps tendon is intracapsular,B,"The shoulder is the commonest joint for dislocation to occur, but posterior dislocation is rare. The shoulder joint is unstable due to the fact that the glenoid cavity is shallow, and the surrounding ligaments are weak. The stability of the joint is achieved by the integrity of the surrounding muscles, that is, the rotator cuff. The least supported part of the joint is inferiorly. The axillary nerve (supplying teres minor) arises from the posterior cord of the brachial plexus and contains fibres derived from C5 and C6 spinal nerve roots. It passes through the quadrilateral space just below the shoulder joint. The nerve then curves around the posterolateral surface of the humerus deep to the deltoid, dividing into anterior and posterior branches, both of which supply the deltoid muscle. The upper lateral cutaneous nerve of the arm arises from the posterior branch and supplies the skin over the deltoid. The axillary nerve also gives a branch to supply the teres minor muscle. The subacromial bursa does not communicate with the shoulder cavity. The triceps has three heads:  Long head (from the infraglenoid tubercle of the scapula) Lateral head (from upper half of posterior surface of shaft of humerus) Medial head (from posterior surface of lower half of shaft of the humerus below the spiral groove).  The common tendon, which is not intracapsular, inserts into the olecranon process of ulna."
motor system,114,Which of the following would indicate an ulnar nerve lesion?,Wasting of the thenar eminence,Anaesthesia of the 3 and a half digits on the ulnar side of the hand,The middle and index fingers are in a claw,Froments test shows a strong pinch grip,Inability to abduct the little finger,E,"The ulnar nerve provides sensation to the skin of the little and the ulnar side of the ring finger. The thenar muscles are supplied by the median nerve. Froments test is when a patient holds paper between their thumb and index finger, and you attempt to pull it from them. A weak grip, especially if there is flexion of the IP joint of the thumb, suggests ulnar nerve palsy."
motor system,115,An elderly male smoker attends clinic with a three month history of a hoarse voice. You proceed to examine his larynx by indirect laryngoscopy and ask him to take a deep breath in so that you can assess vocal cord abduction. Contraction of which muscle causes vocal cord abduction?,The cricothyroid muscle,The lateral cricoarytenoid muscle,The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle,The thyroarytenoid muscle,The transverse arytenoid muscle,C,The posterior cricoarytenoid muscle is an important muscle as it is the only muscle that abducts the vocal cords. It extends from the back of the cricoid to the muscular process of the arytenoids and is supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve.
motor system,116,A 68-year-old woman has undergone plain imaging of her hips for suspected osteoarthritis. Which radiographic feature would suggest osteoarthritis?,Increase in joint space,Osteophytes causing lipping at joint margins,Patchy changes in bone density,Soft-tissue swelling,Subchondral lysis,B,"In osteoarthritis, radiographs show:  an asymmetrical narrowing of the joint space subchondral sclerosis osteophytes cysts, and joint deformity.  Soft tissue swelling is a feature of rheumatoid arthritis. Patchy changes in bone density are seen in Paget's disease of the bone, for example, sclerotic 'white' vertebrae. "
motor system,117,A 15-year-old male noticed swelling on the left knee following a fall while playing. The swelling has not subsided in spite of rest and analgesia. Examination: full knee movement with slight tenderness. He has painless palpable mass in left inguinal region. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Osteosarcoma,Ewing’s sarcoma,Chondrosarcoma,Lymphangiosarcoma,Osteodosteoma,A,"Both occurs in children and young adults but the occurrence of painful symptom during playing is usually a feature of osteosarcoma. In case of osteosarcoma teenagers who are active in sports often complain of pain in the lower femur, or immediately below the knee. If the tumor is large, it can present as overt localised swelling. Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom, because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma"
motor system,118,Which of the following is correct regarding pelvic abscesses?,Are an uncommon cause of intraperitoneal abscess,Are associated with a pyothorax,Can only be identified on CT if there is a full bladder,Commonly present with pneumaturia,May spontaneously drain via the rectum,E,"Pelvic abscess is the most common variety of intraperitoneal abscess. Pus can originate from a proximal source to form a pelvic abscess, for example, perforated duodenal ulcer, but not from the chest as the diaphragm will impede the passage of pus. The abscess can irritate the bladder causing urinary frequency/nocturia. Pneumaturia is pathognomonic of colovesical fistula. If an abscess drains spontaneously via the rectum, they rarely require any further treatment. Ultrasound (not CT) imaging requires a full urinary bladder to identify the pelvic organs and any abscesses present."
motor system,119,A 54 year old patient attends for the results of her bone density scan she tells you she has previously fractured her 4th metatarsal and patella following a fall from a bike.. Her T-score is -2.2. You diagnose her as:,Normal bone density,Myelosclerosis,Osteopenic,Osteoporosis,Severely Osteoporotic,C,T-score is your bone density compared with what is normally expected in a healthy young adult of your sexT-score(0 to -1):Normal bone densityT-score ( -1 to -2.5)OsteopeniaT-score ( -2.5 or less)OsteoporosisPS: The fracture history here is irrelevant especially considering neither are fragility fractures.99% of body calcium is stored in the skeleton as Calcium Phosphate salts. There are several calcium phosphate salts. The most abundant in bone is Hydroxylapatite
motor system,120,Which of the following is true with regard to developmental dysplasia of the hip?,Boys and girls are equally affected,"Developmental dysplasia of the hip occurs in less than 2 in 1,000 live births",Is less common in premature infants,Late walking is a significant feature,Suspected neonatal cases should have an x-ray of the hip,C,"Congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH), now termed developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), is of uncertain aetiology and occurs in some 5-20 cases per 1000 live births. The ratio is 7:1 girls to boys. The left hip is more commonly affected and 20% of cases are bilateral. Late walking is not an associated feature but any child who is not walking at 18 months should have DDH excluded. In many instances there is a strong family history [if a sibling has DDH the risk of another child having DDH is 6%; if a parent has had DDH the risk is 12%; if a parent and sibling have had DDH the risk is 36%] and predominance in females, although this is less marked in late presentations. Breech presentation, caesarean section and being the first-born child are other recognised factors. It is less common in premature infants, possibly related to less exposure to the hormonal changes of late pregnancy. The causes of hip instability are thought to be capsular laxity, acetabular anteversion and possibly subclinical neuromuscular abnormality. The diagnostic sign is elicited at birth by separating the infant's flexed thighs and noting the 'jump' or 'thud' as the femoral head slips back into the socket in the mid range of abduction (Ortolani and Barlow tests). Suspected neonatal cases should be investigated by ultrasonography which gives a dynamic assessment of the acetabulum and femoral head. Once the child starts to walk the restricted hip movement causes gait abnormalities, the limb appears shortened with pelvic asymmetry and there is an anterior groin 'lump' sign. The limb may be extremely rotated and abduction is limited. Splintage with the hips 90 degrees abducted and 90 degrees flexed produces a successful outcome in about 98% of the cases if the instability is identified at or around birth."
motor system,121,Which of the following statements regarding the anatomy of the hand is true?,Contraction of the palmar interossei results in abduction,The anatomical snuff box is bounded by extensor pollicis brevis posteriorly,The insertion of the flexor digitorum profundus muscle is into the distal phalanx,The insertion of the palmaris longus muscle is into the middle phalanx,The tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis muscle give attachment to the lumbrical muscles in the hand,C,Contraction of the palmar interossei results in adduction while contraction of the dorsal interossei results in abduction. In the palm the four tendons of flexor digitorum superficialis split and encircle the corresponding tendon of flexor digitorum profundus to insert into the sides of the middle phalanx. The four tendons of flexor digitorum profundus insert into the palmar surface of the base of the terminal phalanx. The tendons of flexor digitorum profundus muscle give attachment to the lumbrical muscles. Palmaris longus muscle inserts into the central part of the flexor retinaculum and lower part of the palmar aponeurosis. The anatomical snuff box is bounded by extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus anteriorly and by extensor pollicis longus posteriorly.
motor system,122,Which of the following nerves supply the ankle reflex?,"C7, C8","C8, T1",L1,C7,"L5, S1",E,"The ankle jerk is elicited by positioning the person with the knee flexed and the hip externally rotated (or alternatively asking the patient to kneel on a chair). Hold the foot in dorsiflexion, and strike the Achilles tendon directly. Feel the normal response as the foot plantar flexes against your hand. Other deep tendon reflexes include: ∙ Triceps reflex (C6, C7, C8) ∙ Knee jerk reflex (L2, L3, L4)."
motor system,123,Which of the following associations of muscles and nerve roots is correct?,Deltoid and C4,Gastrocnemius and S3,Long flexors of fingers and C8,Quadriceps and L1,Triceps and C5,C,"The deltoid muscle is supplied by the axillary nerve, which has a nerve root of C5, C6. The gastrocnemius is supplied by the tibial nerve, which has a nerve root of S1, S2. Rectus femoris and the three vastus muscles (intermedius, medialis and lateralis) are all supplied by the femoral nerve, which has a nerve root of L2, L3, L4. Triceps brachii is supplied by the radial nerve (C5-C8 {T1}), which has a nerve root of C6 (lateral head), C7 (long head) and C8 (medial head)."
motor system,124,Which of the following is true regarding supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children?,Affect the radial nerve in the majority of cases,Are usually extra-articular,Frequently result in compartment syndrome in the forearm,Require open reduction and internal fixation in more than 50% of cases,Result in hypothenar muscle wasting,B,"In children supracondylar fractures are usually extra-articular, whilst they are frequently intra-articular in adults. This type of fracture most commonly occurs around 6-7 years of age. The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve is the most commonly affected nerve in supracondylar fractures in children. Vascular compromise (injury to the brachial artery) occurs in about 5% of children with supracondylar fractures. However, less than 1% of the children will develop compartment syndrome. Volkmann's ischaemic contracture is a recognised complication of supracondylar fractures in children. Hypothenar muscle wasting is not common with supracondylar fractures, since the hypothenar muscles are innervated by the ulnar nerve. Treatment for undisplaced fractures is above elbow plaster with elbow at 90 degrees. For displaced fractures treatment is closed reduction and percutaneous pinning."

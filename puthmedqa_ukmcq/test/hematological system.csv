hematological system,1,"A 65-year-old man presents with back pain. Examinations: splenomegaly and anemia. Blood: WBC 22, Hgb 10.9, Platelet 100, ESR 25. He has been found to have Philadelphia chromosome. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",ALL,AML,CML,CLL,Lymphoma,C,"anaemia, raised WBC count, low platelet (platelet may be variable) are known features of CML, splenomegaly (particularly if massive) is very suggestive of CML and Philadelphia chromosome is characteristic of CML"
hematological system,2,"Approximately 1% of pregnant women develop clinically important red cell antibodies, the most common being rhesus antibodies. The women negative for D antigen develop antibodies on exposure to D positive blood (such as fetomaternal haemorrhage, abortions and transfusions). This increases the risk of haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN) in subsequent pregnancies. From the following, choose the correct statement about rhesus antibodies in pregnancy.",D positive women are less likely than D negative women to form antibodies to other red cell antigens (such as Kell and Duffy),"Following delivery, the degree of fetomaternal haemorrhage should be calculated on a blood sample from a D negative mother",Maternal antibody titres do not predict haemolytic disease of newborn,Pregnant women should be checked for antibodies at 28 weeks as fetomaternal haemorrhage occurs only after the second trimester.,The fetal Rh type is not dependent on the paternal Rh grouping,B,"Following delivery, the degree of fetomaternal haemorrhage (FMH) should be calculated on a blood sample from a D negative mother to adjust the dose of anti-D in the D negative mother delivering a D positive child. D positive women and D negative women have the same chances of developing antibodies to other red cell antigens. All pregnant women should have a blood group and antibody screen in their first trimester or at presentation, whichever is earlier. The fetal Rh type depends on the paternal and maternal Rh typing. Maternal antibody titres correlate with the degree of haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). "
hematological system,3,An 18-year-old Asian female is noted by her dentist to have gingival hypertrophy. Which of the following is most likely to be responsible for her presentation?,Carbamazepine,Lead poisoning,Phenytoin,Scurvy,Sodium valproate,C,"The inclusion of 'Asian' descent in this question is intended as a distractor. Gum hypertrophy may be seen in conditions such as acute myeloid leukaemias and with drugs such as phenytoin. Of the options here, phenytoin is the most likely. Scurvy (vitamin C deficiency) can be associated with swollen, bleeding gums which can become friable and infected, but true gingival hypertrophy is not classic. Petechiae can occur on the mucosae. Lead toxicity is associated with pigmentation of the gingiva. Carbamazepine is not associated with gingival hyperplasia but recognised side effects include ataxia, drowsiness and blood dyscrasias."
hematological system,4,A previously well 75-year-old woman presented with tiredness and a mildly raised lymphocyte count on her full blood count. A blood film reports: andquot;Smudge cells seen. Is this lady known to have chronic lymphocytic leukaemia?andquot; What is the most appropriate next investigation to confirm this woman's diagnosis?,Bone marrow aspirate,Bone marrow trephine,Immunophenotyping by flow cytometry,Serum immunoglobulins,Ultrasound scan,C,"According to Guidelines on the diagnosis and management of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a definitive diagnosis of CLL is based on the combination of a lymphocytosis and characteristic lymphocyte morphology and immunophenotype. The other tests are additional investigations all used in the workup of CLL."
hematological system,5,"A 19-year-old student in his first year at university presents to the Emergency Department complaining of severe sore throat. He has no past medical history of note and takes no regular medications. On examination he is pyrexial 38.4°C, pulse is 85 and regular, and there is a severe pharyngitis with tonsillar exudates. He also has a fine macular rash over his upper body and there is mild tenderness on abdominal palpation in the left upper quadrant. Neck lymph nodes are enlarged. Investigations:    Hb 140 g/l 135-180   WCC 9.2 x10^9/l (Lymphocytosis, greater than20% atypical lymphocytes seen on film) 6-10   PLT 355 x 10^9/l 150-400   Na 139 mmol/l 135-145   K 4.4 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 105 µmol/l 50-110   Glucose 5.2 mmol/l less than7.0   CRP 65 mg/dl less than10    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",B-cell lymphoma,CMV infection,Epstein-Barr infection,Hodgkin's lymphoma,Streptococcal tonsillitis,C,"The answer is Epstein-Barr infection. The high fever with exudative pharyngitis, coupled with atypical lymphocytes fits well with a diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus infectious mononucleosis. Heterophile antibody testing is used to confirm the diagnosis, although in the early stages of the disease, (1st week), there is a 25% false negative rate. Management is supportive, and in the event, there is significant splenic tenderness/enlargement, the patient should be advised to avoid contact sports for up to eight weeks. Given the short history and presence of atypical lymphocytes, both B cell and Hodgkin's lymphomas are unlikely as the underlying diagnosis. Streptococcal tonsillitis is not associated with atypical lymphocytes. CMV infection is associated with atypical lymphocytes but is much less likely than EBV to be associated with the severe tonsillitis/pharyngitis seen here."
hematological system,6,"A 28 year old female who is 32 weeks pregnant presents with headache, nausea and vomiting and upper abdominal pain. On examination she appears jaundice and there is tenderness in the right upper quadrant. She is hypertensive at 140/80 mmHg. Bloods reveal a macrocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, deranged LFTs and elevated LDH. There is a reticulocytosis and red cell fragmentation on blood film. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Eclampsia,HELLP syndrome,Acute fatty liver of pregnancy,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic pupura,Pre-eclampsia,B,"This patient has pre-clampsia and there is evidence of haemolysis, thrombocytopenia and deranged LFTs making the most likely diagnosis HELLP syndrome. Acute fatty liver of pregnancy does not explain all the symptoms. In eclampsia there is neurological features. TTP again similarly has neurological features and less likely to derange LFTs and as the patient is pregnant and hypertensive then HELLP syndrome is much more likely."
hematological system,7,A patient with hodgkins lymphoma who is under treatment develops high fever. His blood results show WBC <2800 and has a chest infection. Choose the most likely treatment?,Co-amoxiclav,Piperacillin+tazobactam,Erythromycin,Piperacillin+Co-amoxiclav,Penicillin+tazobactam,B,"Here patients WBC is <2800, i.e. patient has leucopenia (probable neutropenia). Piperacillin/Tazobactam may be used in the management of neutropenic patients with fever suspected to be due to a bacterial infection as in patient with postchemotherapy neutropenia. Even febrile neutropenia can be seen in patients with cancer per-se!"
hematological system,8,"A 26-year-old man presents with dark urine, especially in the early morning. Further investigations show that he has haemoglobinuria and haemolytic anaemia. A diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is made. Which of the following is the likely mechanism underlying this condition?",Aberrant fusion of two genes,Impaired protein degradation,Overexpression of cellular oncogene,Post-translational modification,Telomere shortening,D,"Post-translational modification by the GPI glycolipid anchor is essential for the surface expression of many membrane proteins. Defect of GPI biosynthesis due to somatic mutation in the haematopoietic stem cell is the basis for an acquired genetic disease, paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria. The other mechanisms are associated with various other diseases."
hematological system,9,For which of the following patients would a gamma irradiated blood product be recommended?,A 16-year-old thalassaemic receiving regular transfusions,A 19-year-old nulliparous female after a road traffic accident,A 37-year-old patient with Hodgkins' lymphoma receiving chemotherapy,A 42-year-old lady receiving adjuvant hormonal therapy for breast cancer post radical mastectomy,Postoperatively for carcinoma of the colon in a 50-year-old male,C,The most common indications for irradiated blood products include  Those at risk of transfusion associated with graft versus host disease such as neonates Those receiving purine analogues based chemotherapy Hodgkin's lymphoma Immunodeficiency states Post bone marrow transplants  The other scenarios described here do not necessarily represent a immunosuppressed state in the list of conditions eligible for a irradiated blood product.
hematological system,10,"A 60-year-old male presents with bruising and tiredness. Examination reveals four finger breadth splenomegaly and his results reveal:    Haemoglobin 110 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 100 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 900 ×10^9/L (150-400)    Blood film reveals a neutrophilia, basophilia, numerous myelocytes and 4% myeloblasts. Which of the following is likely to be present in this patient?",BCR-ABL gene fusion only,Deletion 11q13,Deletion chromosome 13,Normal chromosomal analysis,Translocation 9;22,E,The Philadelphia chromosome (translocation 9;22) is present in approximately 90% of subjects with chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML). The molecular consequences of this translocation is the generation of the fusion bcr-abl gene which creates an abnormal protein stimulating white cell growth. Only 5% of cases have the bcr-abl fusion gene only without the typical Philadelphia chromosome. Deletion of Ch13 is associated with a poorer prognosis in multiple myeloma. A normal chromosome analysis would be very rare in CML and many haematological malignancies. Deletion of 11q is sseen in many haematological malignancies as well as Myelodysplastic syndrome. Various chromsomal abnormalities impact on the patients prognosis and treatment plan.
hematological system,11,"A 70-year-old man has back pain, anemia and weight loss of gradual onset. In addition to renal failure, he has hypercalcemia. What is the most appropriate investigation?",ANCA,Bone marrow aspirate,Creatinine clearance,Culture of MSU specimen,Cystoscopy,B,Features are suggestive of multiple myeloma. Bone marrow aspirate will show plasma cell infiltrate (60% or more plasma cells in bone marrow)
hematological system,12,"A 52-year-old man is reviewed on the haematology ward. He presented to the Emergency Department with rapidly worsening lethargy, abdominal fullness and a tendency to bleed, he was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL). Which of the following is the translocation associated with the worst prognosis?",1:19,8:14,9:22,11:22,12:21,C,"The 9:22 translocation is known as the Philadelphia translocation, and is found in 30-50% of adults who are diagnosed with ALL, but is more classically associated with CML. In ALL it is associated with a much worse prognosis than in patients who are 9:22 translocation negative, with approximately a 50% reduced survival reported initially although this has improved with wider availability of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The 8:14 chromosomal translocation is associated with a particularly poor prognosis when there is CNS disease, and is found in approximately 1% of adults with ALL.  The 1:19 and 12:21 translocations are both associated with a favourable prognosis in ALL. 1:19 is associated with TCF3/PBX1 expression, (not normally found in lymphoid tissue), and 12:21 is the commonest translocation found in childhood ALL. Taken together they are associated with five-year survival of 85% or greater. The 11:22 translocation is associated with a congenital syndrome characterised by learning difficulties, craniofacial abnormalities and congenital heart disease, but not leukaemia."
hematological system,13,Which of the following is an indication for the use of irradiated blood products?,Emergency O negative blood,Hodgkins Lymphoma undergoing treatment,Splenectomy,Previous multiple transfusion,Myeloma on no treatment,B,Gamma irradiation of blood products is utilised to try to prevent transfusion associated graft versus host disease. Risk factors for this include high dose chemotherapy where the patient is immunosuppressed such as in Hodgkins lymphoma. Patients who have undergone allogeneic bone marrow transplant are also at increased risk.
hematological system,14,"A 64 year old male presents with general malaise, weight loss and night sweats. He also complains of abdominal discomfort in the left upper quadrant. On examination there is evidence of massive splenomegaly. Bloods revealed a low haemoglobin and neutropenia. A blood film reveals leukoerythroblastosis with tear drop poikilocytosis and megakaryocyte fragments. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Myelodysplasia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Myelofibrosis,Acute lymphocytic leukaemia,Non Hodgkins lymphoma,C,"Myelofibrosis is a chronic myeloproliferative disorders which is associated with marrow stem cells appearing in abnormal sites and infiltration of the bone marrow with fibrous tissue. Infiltration can be primary or be secondary to leukaemia, myeloma, metastatic cancer, SLE and toxins. Due to the extramedullary haematopoiesis there can be massive splenomegaly. Bone marrow failure occurs. Initially patients may show an elevated platelet count. However the presentation is as described in the question. Splenic infarcts can occur due to the splenomegaly. The blood film is characteristic and excludes the other diagnoses."
hematological system,15,"A 54 year old gentleman presents with pruritus. He is also having intermittent headaches and dizziness. On examination the patient has a ruddy complexion and splenomegaly. He is hypertensive. Bloods reveal a raised haemoglobin, increased packed cell volume and mildly elevated platelets and white cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Myelodysplasia,Polycythaemia rubra vera,Leukaemia,Thrombocytosis,Non Hodgkins lymphoma,B,"Primary polycythaemia is a myeloproliferative disorder where there is excessive production of not only red blood cells but, platelets and leucocytes as well. There is failure of apoptosis of the progenitor cells thus not only is there a high haemoglobin but there may also be high platelet and white cell count although the increased haemoglobin is predominant along with raised PCV and red cell volume. It leads to plethoric, ruddy complexion, itching, visual disturbance, fatigue and depression. The other options would not lead to a marked elevation in haemoglobin."
hematological system,16,"In nephrotic syndrome, what is the mechanism leading to a prothrombotic state?",Dysfunctional von Willebrands,Increased fibrinolysis,Loss of antithrombin III,Factor V Leiden,Loss of von Willebrands,C,"In the nephrotic syndrome, there is marked proteinuria and loss of antithrombin III and plasminogen in the urine thus leading to increased risk of arterial and venous thrombosis."
hematological system,17,"In Hodgkin's lymphoma, which of the following is associated with a favourable prognosis?",Leukocytosis,Mixed cellularity pathology on lymph node biopsy,Presence of Reed-Sternberg cells on bone-marrow trephine,Presentation over the age of 60 years,Female patient,E,"The classification of Hodgkin's lymphoma is based either on histological grading or clinical staging. The basic Ann Arbor clinical stages are:    Stage Description   I Disease limited to one region   II Disease limited to two regions on the same side of the diaphragm   III Disease on both sides of the diaphragm, limited to lymphadenopathy   III1 As Stage III, plus involvement of the spleen   III2 As Stage III, plus involvement of para-aortic, iliac or mesenteric nodes   IV Diffuse extralymphatic involvement - bone marrow, liver or extra-nodal site not contiguous with lymph nodes    There is some controversy as to whether histology is an important prognostic factor. The stage of disease is a predominant prognostic factor. Men appear to have a slightly worse prognosis. Other factors that may predict a worse prognosis are:  age over 60 anaemia leukocytosis lymphocytopenia, and a low albumin^1.  Serum markers that have been associated with an adverse outcome include:  Soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 Tumour necrosis factor Soluble CD-30 BETA-2 microglobulin Serum IL-10 level.  "
hematological system,18,A 6-year-old boy is brought to the hospital for a 3rd episode of sore throat in 1 month. He is found bleeding from gums and nose and has pale conjunctiva. What’s the single cell type?,Clumped platelets,Microcytes,Granulocyte without blast cells,Blast cells,Mature lymphocytes,D,Diagnosis is ALL. Following points favours the diagnosis of ALL: :i) Age-6yrs ii) recurrent infection (sorethroat) due to neutrpenia and abnormal lymphoblasts which cannot protect from infection iii) thrombocytopenia causing gum and nose bleeding. Iii) anaemia (pale conjunctiva) due to reduced red cell production from marrow occupation by blast cells. It cannot be confirmed unless we do bone marrow aspiration.
hematological system,19,"A 6-month-old baby is noticed to be pale and listless. His complete blood count shows haemoglobin of 60 g/L, and his blood picture shows a hypochromic, microcytic picture. Genetic testing shows the β0β0 genotype. Which statement is correct with regards to this haematological disorder?",A transfusion programme with iron chelation is the best initial approach,Iron chelation is only possible with subcutaneous or intravenous infusion of desferrioxamine,The parents and other siblings should not be screened by genetic testing,There is no increased risk of gallstone formation or bone deformities,Transfusion support should be used sparingly considering the risks of transmission of infections and iron overload,A,"This question relates to the management of severe beta thalassaemia major. Beta thalassaemia major is characterised by anaemia, splenomegaly, bone deformities and early death if not treated appropriately. Treatment revolves around lifesaving red cell concentrate support, with the inherent development of transfusional iron overload, which can be managed with iron chelation, both intravenous/subcutaneous (desferrioxamine) or oral (deferasirox). The next of kin should be offered screening. Regular transfusion with attention to iron chelation is the mainstay of treatment, although haemopoietic stem cell transplantation has a possible role with curative intent, hence a transfusion programme with iron chelation is the best initial approach. In those with extramedullary haematopoesis, uncontrolable iron overload or those symptomatic despite transfusion a stem cell allograft transplant should be considered from a healthy matched sibling or a matched unrelated donor."
hematological system,20,In polycythaemia Rubra Vera which of the following mutational analysis should be performed?,BRCA1,p53,JAK2,BCR-ABL,NOTCH1,C,JAK2 mutations have been associated with Polycythaemia Rubra Vera. It is a member of the Janus kinase family and erythroid precursors become hypersensitive to EPO. It has been recommended that JAK2 mutation been included as a major criterion in the diagnostic criteria for Polycythaemia Rubra Vera.
hematological system,21,What is the mechanism of thrombophilia due to factor V Leiden mutation?,Resistant to antithrombin III inactivation,Increased sensitivity to activated protein C mediated inactivation,Resistant to activated protein C mediated inactivation,Increased sensitivity to activated protein S mediated inactivation,Resistant to activated protein S mediated inactivation,C,Factor V Leiden mutation leads to a mutated factor V which is less sensitive to activated protein C mediated inactivation. It is an autosomal dominant condition and is the most common cause of familial thrombophilia.
hematological system,22,A 30-year-old woman presents with a deep vein thrombosis. Of note in her past medical history is three early miscarriages. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 128 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 3.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 35 ×10^9/L (150-400)    What investigation is most likely to be abnormal?,Antiphospholipid antibodies,Homocystine concentration,Indium-labelled white cell scan,Platelet function test,Protein C concentration,A,"The combination of thrombophilia, recurrent miscarriage, thrombocytopenia and leucopenia in this patient indicates a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, probably in associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a common cause of acquired thrombophilia and characterised by arterial and/or venous thrombosis and pregnancy mortality in association with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. These are a heterogenous group of approximately twenty autoantibodies directed against phospholipid binding plasma proteins. Three of the most clinically important are the lupus anticoagulant, anti-beta-2 glycoproetin I antibodies and the anticardiolipin antibodies. They can be detected either by phospholipid-dependent coagulation test for lupus anticoagulant or ELISA test for anticoagulation and anti-β2GPI antibodies. Antibodies should be demonstrated on at least two occasions separated by 12 weeks. Antiphospholipid syndrome may be primary, or associated with other conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Antiphospholipid syndrome is the most important treatable cause of recurrent miscarriage, defined as the loss of three or more consecutive pregnancies. 15% of women with recurrent miscarriage have persistently positive tests for either lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies, compared to 2% with an uncomplicated obstetric history. In future untreated pregnancies, women with recurrent miscarriage and persistently positive anticardiolipin antibodies have a miscarriage rate of 90%. The majority of miscarriages occur between 7 and 12 weeks gestation, and foetuses are typically chromosomally normal. It is thought the antibodies affect trophoblast invasion and placentation. Antiphospholipid syndrome is also an important cause of early onset pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction. Aspirin and low-dose heparin is the treatment of choice to reduce the risk of miscarriage in confirmed antiphospholipid syndrome. This combination has been showed to lead to a 70% live birth rate in future pregnancies. Intravenous immunoglobulin can also be used. Outside of pregnancy treatment is with low molecular weight heparin, warfarin or Direct oral anticoagulants. Elevated levels of circulating homocysteine increase the risk of developing coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease but they are not commonly associated with pregnancy loss. An indium white blood cell scan is a nuclear medicine study in which leucocytes are removed from the patient, tagged with Indium-111 and reinjected into the patient. They can then be used to localise areas of infection and inflammation, such as thrombophlebitis and osteomyelitis. Platelet function studies measure the platelet's ability to adhere and aggregate. They are not particularly reliable or accurate, and therefore do not have a central role in clinical practice. Protein C is one of the major inhibitors of the coagulation system. Deficiency is associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis, but not classically an increase rate of miscarriage. "
hematological system,23,A 47 year old male is undergoing chemotherapy for high grade non Hodgkins Lymphoma with bulky disease. Which of the following should be administered before commencing chemotherapy?,IV Hydration and Allopurinol,Nil required,Dexamethasone,IV Hydration,IV sodium bicarbonate,A,"Tumour lysis syndrome is secondary to rapid breakdown of tumour cell (typically haematological malignancies) which leads to hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia and acute renal failure. It occurs following chemotherapy. If risk of tumour lysis syndrome is high then IV hydration and hypouricaemic agents such as allopurinol or newer rasburicase (recombinant urate oxidase) should be utilised. Urinary alkalinisation with sodium bicarbonate has also been used. Non Hodgkins Lymphoma is at moderate risk of development of Tumour Lysis Syndrome."
hematological system,24,A patient with acute myeloid leukaemia presents with disseminated intravascular coagulation. What chromosomal abnormality would you expect to find?,11q23,T(922),T(1517),Inv 16,T(821),C,"DIC is a common complication of acute promyelocytic leukaemia. It is a subtype of AML caused by t(15;17) which causes the retinoic acid receptor  to along with PML. T(8;21) is associated with AML without maturation, inv16 with acute myelomonocytic and 11q23 with acute myelomonocytic and acute monocytic. T(9;22) is the Philadelphia chromosome which leads to chronic myeloid leukaemia."
hematological system,25,"During the evaluation of a patient who developed hyperkalaemia, you went through the drug chart. Which of the following items can be continued without the worry of worsening hyperkalaemia?",Cyclosporine,Digoxin,Ibuprofen,Spironolactone,Thyroxine,E,"Thyroxine does not cause nor exacerbate hyperkalaemia. Translocation of potassium from the cells into the extracellular space can occur from digoxin overdose due to its dose-dependent Na-K-ATPase pump inhibition. Other common mechanisms include impaired urinary potassium excretion, notably hypoaldosteronism."
hematological system,26,A 16-year-old girl presents with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. Her lymph node biopsy reveals a nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease. Which one of the following features indicates a poorer prognosis?,Fatigue,Mediastinal mass of 3 cm,Night sweats,Pruritus,Recent Epstein-Barr virus infection,C,"Important prognostic features in Hodgkin's disease (HD) are stage B symptoms:  Fever Night sweats, and Weight loss.  A mass of greater than10 cm in size is also a poor prognostic factor. Therefore although fatigue and pruritus are common, they have no prognostic significance. EBV infection commonly is associated with HD but has no prognostic significance."
hematological system,27,"A 60 year old female is suffering from back pain which has woken her from her sleep for the last few months. An xray reveals vertebral collapse and lytic lesions. She has also noticed feeling thirsty and has been more constipated. Bloods reveal a normochromic normocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia, renal impairment and hypercalcaemia. What investigation will provide a definitive diagnosis?",Bone marrow biopsy,Peripheral blood film,Bence Jones protein,Serum protein electrophoresis,MRI,D,"The most likely diagnosis is multiple myeloma which is diagnosed via serum protein electrophoresis which reveals a paraprotein band, most commonly of IgG type. Bence Jones proteins (kappa or lambda light chains) should also be screened for but are not always evident."
hematological system,28,"A 24-year-old male presents after developing a bluish discolouration of the body, lips and nails. He denies any relevant past medical history. Examination reveals a central cyanosis and a grey complexion. Investigation revealed:    Haemoglobin 170 g/L (130-180)   PaO2 13.0 kPa (11.3-12.6)   SaO2 (using an oximeter) 85% (greater than95)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Argyria,Cyanotic congenital heart disease,Haemochromatosis,Methaemoglobinaemia,Methylene blue poisoning,D,"This patient is otherwise well and has no specific features of congenital heart disease (clubbing, etc). He appears desaturated with saturations of 85%, yet good pO2. This is a typical description of methaemoglobinaemia, which is the accumulation of reversibly oxidised methaemoglobin causing reduced oxygen affinity of the Hb molecule with consequent cyanosis. It can occur due to an inherited condition or as a consequence of drugs such as nitrates. Argyria is colloidal silver toxicity."
hematological system,29,A 16-year-old male has had a splenectomy following traumatic splenic rupture in a road traffic accident. Which one of the following haematological features may be present on the blood film six months later?,Eliptocytosis,Fragmented cells,Howell-Jolly bodies,Macrocytosis,Thrombocytopenia,C,"The spleen removes intracytoplasmic inclusions such as Howell-Jolly bodies, Heinz bodies and siderotic granules. All of these are increased after splenectomy. Senescent cells are removed by the spleen, and when it is absent:  The red cells are flatter and thinner than normal Target cells and spherocytes are increased and Osmotic fragility is decreased.  There are also depressed levels of IgM, properidin and tuftsin (which promotes phagocytosis). "
hematological system,30,Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer leads to an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma. Which other cancer are patients particularly at risk of?,Ovarian cancer,Hepatocellular cancer,Gastric cancer,Prostatic cancer,Endometrial cancer,E,"HNPCC is an autosomal dominant condition which leads to an increased risk of colorectal cancer due to mutations in the mismatch repair genes  It also leads to an increased risk of other cancers predominantly endometrial cancer but also ovarian, gastric, small intestine, pancreas, renal, ureter and prostatic."
hematological system,31,A 68-year-old man complained of tiredness and lethargy. On examination there was 2 cm hepatomegaly and 7 cm splenomegaly. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 174 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 39.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)    White cell differential:    Neutrophils 22.2 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Lymphocytes 1.1 ×10^9/L (1.5-4)   Monocytes 1.0 ×10^9/L (0-0.8)   Eosinophils 0.4 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   Basophils 2.1 ×10^9/L (0-0.1)   Metamyelocytes 1.2 ×10^9/L -   Myelocytes 10.9 ×10^9/L -   Myeloblasts 1.3 ×10^9/L -   Nucleated RBC 3 per 100 rbc -   Platelet count 585 ×10^9/L (150-400)    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute myeloid leukaemia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML),Essential thrombocythaemia (ET),Myelofibrosis (MF),Primary proliferative polycythaemia (PRV),B,"The presentation is typical with vague symptoms of malaise and splenomegaly. The blood film also shows the typical high white cell count and there are all stages of myeloid cell maturation present in the peripheral blood with the metamyelocytes suggesting CML. Thrombocythaemia is also seen in CML. AML would often present with pancytopaenia and acute onset symptoms of lethargy, infections or bleeding over the space of weeks and months.  ET often presents with no symptoms and picked up on routine bloods. It is associated with a solitary thrombocythaemia. MF can transform from ET and leads to a leukoerythroblastic blood film with patients at risk of transforming to the more aggresive AML over time.  PRV is associated with an isolated raised haemoglobin."
hematological system,32,An 18 month old baby presents with an acutely swollen knee. He has just begun walking but his mother denies any trauma. On examination there is a large effusion of the left knee with restricted painful movement. He is apyrexial and otherwise well. Bloods reveal a prolonged APTT. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Haemophilia A,Non accidental injury,Haemophilia B,Von Willebrands disease,Septic arthritis,A,"The history is indicative of a spontaneous haemarthrosis. Given this presentation and the age of the patient the most likely diagnosis is Haemophilia A. Haemophilia A is an autosomal recessive condition which leads to factor VIII deficiency. It is five times more common than Haemophilia B. It can present in a mild, moderate or severe fashion depending on factor VIII activity. Patients may only bleed after surgery, or venepuncture or bleed spontaneously such as in this case spontaneous haemarthroses which is highly indicative of this as the diagnosis. APTT is prolonged. Treatment can be prophylactically in those with severe disease. Factor VII concentrate is administered in the acute setting. FFP and cryoprecipitate can be used however only if concentrate is not available as there is a risk of developing factor VIII antibodies. Desmopressin can also be used to raise factor VIII levels."
hematological system,33,A 28-year-old primigravid woman developed a swollen painful left leg at 12 weeks gestation. Doppler ultrasound of her leg venous system showed a left popliteal vein thrombosis. Which one of the following treatments is associated with the greatest risk to the fetus?,Aspirin ,Intravenous unfractionated heparin,Subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin,Subcutaneous unfractionated heparin,Warfarin ,E,"Warfarin is generally avoided in pregnancy. In the first trimester, it is associated with an increased risk of miscarriage, and teratogenic side effects which include chondrodysplasia patellae, asplenia and diaphragmatic herniae. In the second and third trimesters, it is associated with retroplacental and intracerebral foetal haemorrhage, as well as foetal microcephaly, optic atrophy and developmental delay. Low molecular weight heparin is the mainstay of treatment of veno-occlusive disease in pregnancy. It does not cross the placenta, but can be associated with maternal bone demineralisation and thrombocytopenia. Aspirin appears to be relatively safe. "
hematological system,34,"A 35-year-old gentleman presents complaining of a 6-month history of weight loss and tiredness. On further questioning, the patient also reports night sweats. Physical examination shows hepatosplenomegaly but no lymphadenopathy. Blood film examination shows a considerable increase in the white cell count, with all stages of myeloid maturation presentation, together with thrombocytosis, basophilia, and eosinophilia. Which of the following haematological conditions is most consistent with this patient's presentation?",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Acute myeloid leukaemia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Hodgkin lymphoma,Leukaemoid reaction,C,"At the time of diagnosis, most CML patients (85% to 90%) are in the chronic phase of CML (the other phases are accelerated and blast stages). The diagnosis is suggested by an incidental laboratory detection of an increased WBC count. When they are present, symptoms in CML patients generally relate to a hypermetabolic state, excessive leukocyte count, or splenic enlargement, and include fatigue, night sweats, weight loss and abdominal fullness related to organomegaly. The most characteristic laboratory feature of CML in the chronic phase is an increase in WBC count, with all stages of maturation present. Accompanying the leukocytosis may be an increased platelet count and an increase in the number of basophils and eosinophils in the peripheral blood, as well as in the bone marrow. Definitive diagnosis is confirmed via the presence of the bcr-abl transcript, known as the Philadelphia chromosome. "
hematological system,35,A 22-year-old male presents with episodic nausea and abdominal pain although he has maintained a normal weight. The symptoms have been attributed to irritable bowel syndrome. There are no abnormalities on examination. Blood tests were performed which reveal:    Haemoglobin 122 g/L (130-180)   MCV 92 fL (80-96)   White cell count 6.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 310 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Reticulocytes 5% (0.5-2.4)   Bilirubin 42 µmol/L (1-22)   AST/ALP Normal   Coombs' test Negative   Haptoglobin Mild decrease    Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Acute intermittent porphyria,Dubin-Johnson syndrome,Gilbert's syndrome,Hereditary spherocytosis,Viral hepatitis,D,"A tricky question but a typical blood result that you might encounter in your daily practice. There are a number of possible options, so it's important to consider all of the details presented here in order to choose the most likely, based on the evidence in the test result, rather than being distracted by one of the indices in isolation. This patient has an elevated bilirubin concentration and elevated reticulocyte count suggesting haemolysis. The most likely explanation would be hereditary spherocytosis which could be confirmed on blood film. This too explains the symptoms of nausea and abdominal pains suggesting gallstones, which are common even in mild disease. Hereditary spherocytosis is usually an incidentally detected condition unless the person has active hemolysis, gall stones or uncomfortable splenomegaly. In this situation, which is not uncommon, the presentation is with gall stones. Haemolysis is predominantly extravascular, and haptoglobins are therefore only slightly decreased (rather than in intravascular haemolysis when they are more significantly depleted). Gilbert's syndrome results in an isolated raised unconjugated bilirubin, whereas Dublin-Johnson syndrome is conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Acute intermittent porphyria is due to a deficiency in heam production and results in episodes of severe abdominal pain usually associated with significant neurological symptoms. You would expect raised ALT and AST in viral hepatitis. "
hematological system,36,"A 54-year-old man who has recently been diagnosed with hereditary haemochromatosis comes to the genetics clinic with his two sons, aged 24 and 19. They wish to enquire about family screening. Which of the following tests is appropriate?",Screen for 282Y mutation,Test ferritin,"Test ferritin, liver biopsy","Test ferritin, transferrin saturation","Test ferritin, transferrin saturation, and screen for 282Y mutation",E,"The answer is to test ferritin, transferrin saturation, and to screen for 282Y mutation. Haemochromatosis is a genetic condition which has variable penetrance. For this reason, ferritin and transferrin saturation are assessed to determine the degree of iron overload, and 282Y mutation status is assessed to confirm the underlying aetiology. Screening the first degree relatives of a case of haemochromatosis is only recommended when patients reach the age of 18 or over. Screening for the 282Y mutation alone is inappropriate because of variable penetrance of haemochromatosis, and ferritin is elevated in patients with chronic liver disease of other aetiology, not just haemochromatosis alone. Liver biopsy is inappropriate, as it is an invasive investigation, and in asymptomatic patients ferritin, transferrin, and 282Y mutation testing are sufficient to determine the diagnosis."

hematological system,40,"A 35 year old gentleman undergoes minor surgery and bleeds profusely following this. You note that bloods prior to his surgery reveal a prolonged APTT, normal PT and bleeding time. He states that as a child he would bruise easily and after teeth being extracted he would bleed for  a long time. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Von willebrands disease,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,Liver disease,Thrombocytopenia,C,Haemophilia B is the most likely diagnosis. It is an autosomal recessive condition and it is due to factor IX deficiency. It presents similarly to Haemophilia A but is often milder. Von Willebrands disease leads to prolonged APTT and bleeding time. There is no history to suspect liver disease and it would tend to lead to a prolonged PT also. Thrombocytopenia does not lead to a prolonged APTT.

What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukemia,Aplastic anemia,HIV infection,ITP (Idiopathic or Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura),SLE,D,"As the patient is otherwise well acute leukemia, HIV and SLE is unlikely. Normal wbc count excludes aplastic anemia. So likely diagnosis is ITP. Isolated thrombocytopenia with bruising and petichiae and menorrhagia are strong indicators of ITP. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, is a type of thrombocytopenic purpura defined as an isolated low platelet count with a normal bone marrow in the absence of other causes of low platelets. Two distinct clinical syndromes manifest as an acute condition in children and a chronic condition in adults. The acute form often follows an infection and spontaneously resolves within two months. Chronic immune thrombocytopenia persists longer than six months with a specific cause being unknown. ITP is an autoimmune disease with antibodies detectable against several platelet surface structures and the immune system destroys these antibody bearing platelets"

In this age group, the most likely diagnosis is a low-grade lymphoproliferative disorder, for example, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. This, as mentioned, is a low-grade condition, and does not require immediate treatment; patients undergo a period of observation, often quite lengthy, before any treatment is indicated. The indication for treatment would include:  disabling B symptoms lymphocyte doubling time of less than six months bone marrow compromise autoimmune haemolysis or immune thrombocytopenia.  He is never going to be cured of this condition, and therefore it would not be necessary to delay/cancel surgery.

hematological system,48,"A 32-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department with right upper quadrant pain related to cholecystitis. The pain settled with conservative management, but the surgeons noticed when they admitted her that she appeared to have splenomegaly. You examine her and confirm that she has an enlarged spleen. On further questioning, she tells you that her father had his spleen removed. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 109 g/L (115-165)   Spherocytes and reticulocytes seen on film   Mean corpuscular volume 102 fL (80-96)   White cell count 7.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 180 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the next most appropriate next investigation in the diagnostic work?",Autoimmune profile,Bone marrow biopsy,Coombs' test,Osmotic fragility test,Ultrasound scan abdomen,C,"This patient has a history which is strongly suggestive of hereditary spherocytosis, with increased haemolysis leading to increased risk of gallstones as seen here. Spherocytosis occurs because of inherited defects in the membrane of red blood cells, leading to reduced cell deformability and this leads to the cells being removed by the spleen, which is the cause of progressive splenic enlargement. MCHC is high but MCV may vary depending on the degree of reticulocytosis. The osmotic fragility test is now considered to be unreliable. If the Coomb's test is positive or negative this will deterine the next step in your diagnostic work up to rule out casues of haemolytic anaemia. It is more commonly known as the Direct Antiglobulin test or DAT. Twenty to 30% of patients have mild disease, and, as in this case, can present later in life, but 60-70% have more severe anaemia and splenic enlargement which leads to presentation in childhood. Elective splenectomy is often required in severe cases, but patients with mild hereditary spherocytosis (HS) may require no intervention at all. This question is slightly out of date (given the osmotic fragility test option), but similar ones may still appear in the MRCP. In current clinical practice, most diagnoses can be made based on family history, typical clinical features and laboratory features (spherocytes, increased reticulocytes, raised mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration). Additional tests are only required for equivocal cases, and these include the cryohaemolysis test and EMA binding or gel electrophoresis of reticulocyte membranes. Testing in suspected HS is now done via genetic testing for abnormalities in the ANK1 geneor other less commonly affected genes. "

It is inherited as an autosomal gene, heterozygous (HbAS) and homozygous (HbSS) forms exist. A low partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) causes HbS to polymerise and precipitate resulting in sickling of the erythrocyte. HbSS patients sickle at PO2 of 5-6 kPa and HbAS patients sickle at PO2 of 2.5-4 kPa. A mild disease is produced when heterozygotes for HbS combine with other haemoglobins, for example, haemoglobin C, thus creating HbSC. Sickling occurs at around 4 kPa. Diagnosis of sickle cell disease requires the detection of HbS. The Sickledex test involves the addition of reagent to blood; turbidity confirming the presence of HbS, but it gives no information on other haemoglobins. Haemoglobin electrophoresis is the only investigation that determines the nature of the haemoglobinopathy."

What is the most likely cause of the failure of her haemoglobin to respond to this treatment?",Acquired sideroblastic anaemia,Coeliac disease,Folate deficiency,Inadequate dosage of iron,Poor compliance with therapy,E,"The most likely explanation for the failure of an iron deficiency anaemia to respond to iron therapy in a menstruant female is poor compliance. It is likely that the dose that this patient is prescribed would be adequate and if not some response would still be expected. There is no evidence of a concomitant folate deficiency as suggested by the blood picture, which would also argue against coeliac disease. Similarly, there is no evidence to suggest an acquired sideroblastic anaemia where a raised MCV and increased ferritin may be expected."

What is the most appropriate treatment prior to dental surgery?,Cryoprecipitate,DDAVP,Fresh frozen plasma,High purity factor VIII concentrate,Recombinant factor VIII concentrate,B,"DDAVP (desmopressin) is the choice treatment for mild von Willebrand's disease, which would include type I, and the majority of type II, although there is some controversy in type II B as it is thought that DDAVP can exacerbate thrombocytopenia that can accompany this type of von Willebrand's. It is of no use in type III - severe von Willebrand's disease. The history tells us that she has mild disease. You would not use cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma in these patients in this era due to potential viral transmission risk from blood products. For severe disease, you would use a von Willebrand factor concentrate, not factor VIII concentrate."

This can be either primary or secondary, and both are possibilities in this case. Smoking can result in secondary polycythaemia, but the raised white cell and platelet count are suspicious for a primary cause. Another possible cause is spurious polycythaemia which is caused by depleted plasma volume rather than raised red cell mass. Treatment of these conditions varies significantly and therefore it is important to distinguish between them.  Therefore, the most useful and appropriate initial investigation is red cell mass studies which will distinguish between true and relative polycythaemia but the test to distinguish if this is a clonal cause driving a primary polycythaemia is mutations for myeloproliferative neoplams screen by JAK2, CALR and MPL mutation.  Further investigations will then be dictated by the the results of this initial test; an ultrasound scan (USS) bone marrow, etc., and blood gases may be needed after the initial red cell mass studies. Whilst a bone marrow trephine is likely to be definitive in determining if a myeloproliferative disorder is present, it is invasive and therefore it is important to establish whether true polycythaemia is present first.  The leucocyte alkaline phosphatase score is rather outdated and seldom performed."
hematological system,56,A 70-year-old woman is on multiple medications for various conditions and she is found to have a macrocytic anaemia with a low serum B12. Which of the following medications is a possible cause of the B12 deficiency?,Amiodarone,Ezetimibe,Metformin,Nicotinic acid,Sodium valproate,C,"Long term treatment with metformin increases the risk of vitamin B12 deficiency. The possibility of metformin-associated B12 deficiency should be considered in patients on metformin who suffer cognitive impairment, peripheral neuropathy, subacute combined degeneration of the cord or anaemia. Regular measurement of vitamin B12 concentrations during long term metformin treatment should be strongly considered. Amiodarone may cause haemolytic anaemia, aplastic anaemia or thrombocytopenia but not B12 deficiency. Ezetimibe can cause thrombocytopenia but not B12 deficiency. Nicotinic acid can cause prolonged prothrombin time, and reduced platelet count but not B12 deficiency.

It is a malignant proliferation of plasma cells. There is infiltration of bone marrow leading to bone destruction and bone marrow failure and production of a monoclonal antibody. It is characterised by osteolytic bone lesions, renal disease and immunodeficiency. It can lead to symptoms as above such as bone pain, or symptoms of hypercalcaemia such as constipation. It may also present with pathological fractures, anaemia, infections or hyperviscosity. Non Hodgkins lymphoma would tend to lead a raised white cell count and hypercalcaemia is usually not observed. MGUS presents with a paraprotein band but none of the signs or symptoms of Myeloma. B12 deficiency can present with pancytopenia but does not explain the back pain or hypercalcaemia."

What will you do next?",Wait for blood test,Start broad spectrum IV antibiotics,Oral antibiotics,CBC,Monitor pyrexia,B,The patient is immunocompromized with high fever (40C) suggestive of infection. Broad spectrum IV antibiotic should be started empirically while waiting for blood reports
hematological system,67,"A 54-year-old man comes to the endocrine clinic for review. He has a history of type 2 diabetes which is currently managed with gliclazide 80 mg BD. Most recently he has been diagnosed with abnormal liver function which the GP suspects is cirrhosis, although he claims he does not drink more than three to four glasses of wine per week. He has split from his partner and admits to erectile dysfunction problems going back over the past three years. On examination, he looks tanned and has signs of chronic liver disease. There is sparse secondary sexual hair. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 148 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 6.0 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 222 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 130 μmol/L (60-120)   ALT 230 U/L (5-40)   Glucose 10.5 mmol/L (less than6.0)    Which of the following is the most appropriate single test with respect to revealing the underlying diagnosis?",Hepatitis serology,Serum ferritin,Serum iron,Serum testosterone,Transferrin saturation,E,"The clinical presentation here is highly suspicious for genetic haemochromatosis. The best way to measure iron overload is via transferrin saturation which is calculated from the serum iron and the serum total iron binding capacity. If the saturation is greater than 55% then genetic testing for the two commonest mutations, C282Y and H63D should be considered. Liver biopsy is indicated where there is evidence of liver damage, as indicated here by the raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Treatment is with venesection, which is indicated until transferrin saturation falls to below 16%. Diabetes mellitus and hypogonadism may respond in some patients to venesection. "
hematological system,68,Which of the following does not inhibit iron absorption?,Phytates,Antacids,Calcium,Tannins,Vitamin C,E,"All of the options except vitamin C which improves absorption, lead to a reduction in iron absorption."
hematological system,69,A 59-year-old male is referred with an abnormal full blood count (FBC). He had presented to his general practitioner with a flu-like illness which has since subsided but a FBC revealed a platelet count of 800 x10^9/L (150-400 x10^9) which has remained persistently elevated but with no other abnormality on the FBC. He is otherwise entirely asymptomatic and no abnormalities are noted on examination. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?,Anagrelide,Aspirin,Hydroxycarbamide,Observation,Plateletpheresis,D,"There are a number of adverse prognostic markers for essential thrombocythaemia (ET):  Age above 60 Symptomatology - particularly thrombosis and Platelet count above 1500.  Generally, the prognosis is extremely good in ET with survival of over two decades expected. This could still be regarded as reactive following his flu like illness. Should it persist then he will need molecular testing on peripheral blood for mutations associated with ET. Even then given his age and lack of symptoms he will unlikely need any treatment yet.  The risk of bleeding can also be a problem and although you may think that aspirin would be appropriate the evidence is conflicting."
hematological system,70,"A 78-year-old woman is brought to the hospital complaining of back pain and is referred to the surgeon. She has been saying that her mother is due to visit her today and that somebody must have broken her lower back as she is in agony. Labs: creatinine 295mmol/l, calcium 3.03mmol/l. Which investigation is most likely to lead to a diagnosis?",US KUB,XR Spine,IVU,Bence-Jones Protein,Mental state exam,D,"Severe back pain, high calcium level and renal impairment are typical of multiple myeloma"
hematological system,71,"A 68 year old female with CLL presents with tiredness and shortness of breath on exertion which has been worsening over the last month. Her bloods reveal a haemoglobin of 7.0 g/dL, low normal platelets, elevated white cell count and an elevated bilirubin although her other LFTs are normal. Which investigation will provide the likely cause of the anaemia?",Elevated LDH,Nil required as secondary to disease,Haemosiderinuria,Bone marrow biopsy,Direct antiglobulin test,E,"Patients with CLL can have anaemia for a number of reasons. These include bone marrow failure, hypersplenism and secondary to haemolytic anaemia which patient with CLL are at an increased risk of developing. In this case platelet levels and white cell counts are not low and therefore bone marrow failure is not the case. There is evidence of an elevated bilirubin indicating haemolysis as the most likely cause. The Direct antiglobulin test or indirect can be utilised to confirm the diagnosis. Raised LDH will indicate haemolysis but not provide the definitive diagnosis. Similarly haemosiderinuria only indicates intravascular haemolysis and it is most likely extravascular."
hematological system,72,Mr YB is a patient who regularly attends the anticoagulant clinic. He is very concerned as he has been recently started on a new drug by his GP. He asks you whether it would enhance the anticoagulant effect. Which of the following may increase the potential for bleeding in patients taking warfarin?,Carbamazepine,Clopidogrel,Griseofulvin,Phenobarbitone,St. John's wort,B,"Clopidogrel does not appear to have a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of warfarin. However, the concurrent use of clopidogrel with warfarin increases the bleeding risk. All other drugs in the options are C-P450 enzyme inducers so would decrease the anticoagulant effect "
hematological system,73,You are evaluating a new agent which is thought to improve the recognition of foreign antigen by antigen presenting cells (APCs). Which of the following correctly represents one aspect of the physiology of APCs?,Antigen is presented via MHC class I complexes,Antigen presented on APCs is recognised by CD4 positive cells,APCs are required before a response to viruses can be generated,Direct antigenic stimulation still requires APCs,Follicular dendritic cells express MHC class 2,B,"Extracellular antigen which is not directly recognised as foreign requires processing by APCs to generate an immune response. This process involves these cells expressing antigenic peptides in conjunction with MHC class II. Antigen is presented via MHC class II complexes, MHC class I aids in the recognition of virally infected cells. Direct stimulation of an immune response may occur in the absence of APCs. Follicular dendritic cells are a distinct lineage which do not express MHC class II, but can still bind the Fc portion of antibodies. APCs are not required before an immune response to viral infection can be successfully mounted."
hematological system,74,An 80-year-old man presents with tiredness and weakness. A diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome is suspected. Which of the following statements regarding myelodysplastic syndrome is correct?,Absence of ring sideroblasts on the blood film excludes myelodysplasia as a diagnosis,Cytotoxic chemotherapy is likely to be part of his treatment,He is more likely to die from an infection than from leukaemic transformation,"If blast cells constitute 1% of the total white cells, this signifies leukaemic transformation","On a blood film, neutrophils typically show toxic granulation",C,"The patient has myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Myelodysplastic syndrome is a disease of old age. Men are affected more frequently than women. 80% of patients present because of symptoms of anaemia. The blood film typically shows pancytopenia with hypogranular neutrophils. The number of blasts seen varies. The disease can be classified into the following subtypes( WHO classification 2008):  Refractory anaemia with unilineage dysplasia- ie anaemia, neutropaenia or thrombocytopaenia (less than5% blasts) Refractory anaemia with ring sideroblasts (less than5% blasts; greater than15% sideroblasts) Refractory anaemia with multilineage dysplasia ( based on bone marrow dysplasia in 2 or more myeloid lineages) Refractory anaemia with excess blasts-1(5-9% blasts) and refractory anaemia with excess blasts -2 (10-19%) Myelodysplasia unclassified Myelodysplasia with isolated 5qdel( cytogenetic abnormality with prognostic significance)  Blasts greater than 20% is now classified as acute myeloid leukaemia. Few patients require aggressive therapy and most need only supportive care. As the vast majority are elderly patients with other medical conditions, excessive intervention is unwarranted. Transfusions of packed red cells or platelets may be required and antibiotics for intercurrent infections. Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and recombinant erythropoietin (r-Epo) can improve blood counts. Aggressive cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally reserved for treatment of transformation to acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) in younger patients. Median survival is based on cytogenetic profiling to establish risk of progression to AML and overal survival. Patients are more likely to have serious infections or life-threatening bleeds than blastic transformation."
hematological system,75,"In which of the following situations, should a patient not be given low molecular weight heparin prophylaxis antenatally?",Previous DVT and proven thrombophilia,Previous pregnancy related DVT but no evidence thrombophilia,Recurrent DVT,Previous DVT and first degree relative with history of DVT,First degree relative with history of DVT,E,"In patients with no history of DVT and only a first degree relative history of DVT, this is not a definite indication for LMWH prophylaxis and the patient should be assessed. All other options are indications for LMWH prophylaxis antenatally."

What is the single most likely causative factor?",Lymphoma,Polycythemia,IDA,Uremia,Drug induced,A,"Cervical lymphadenopathy, lethargy, night sweats and itching are well known features of lymphoma"
hematological system,77,"A 26 year old female presents to her GP after noticing her urine has been a dark brown colour. She admits to feeling increasingly tired over the last few months and has noticed herself bruising easily. Bloods reveal a low haemoglobin which is macrocytic. She also has low platelets and evidence of increased LDH, low haptoglobin and increased reticulocyte count. A dipstick reveals haematuria however microscopy does not reveal in red blood cells. What test would provide the definitive diagnosis?",Bone marrow biopsy,Hams test,Sugar water test,Flow cytometry,LDH,D,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is an acquired genetic disorder which leads to a deficiency of proteins (decay accelerating factor and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) which protect erythrocytes (and other myeloid cells) from lysis by complement. This increases their susceptibility to complement mediated lysis and thus haemolytic anaemia. Previously the Ham test or sugar water test were utilised to show that erythrocytes had increased susceptibility to lyse however flow cytometry for DAF and MIRL is over taking both these tests.
hematological system,78,"A 48 year old male of African descent presents with a long history of a microcytic anaemia which has not responded to iron supplementation. The patient is otherwise well and has no bleeding history. His bloods reveal a microcytic anaemia, however haematinics are normal. A blood film reveals hypochromia and target cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Haemolytic Anaemia,Alpha thalassaemia minor,Beta thalassaemia,Sickle Cell Trait,Iron Deficiency Anaemia,B,"The most likely diagnosis is alpha thalassaemia minor which presents as a microcytic, hypochromic anaemia and should be suspected in African descent and those not responding to iron supplementation. Unlike beta thalassaemia haemoglobin electrophoresis is not usually helpful as it is normal. Iron deficiency is unlikely given the lack of response to iron supplementation. In sickle cell trait there is often a normal haemoglobin. Beta thalassaemia presents at a much younger age usually in the first year of life and there is a severe anaemia. In haemolytic anaemic this can often be macrocytic and there is evidence of reticulocytes."
hematological system,79,"A 70-year-old lady is referred to haematology for investigation of an anaemia of 90 g/L coupled with thrombocytopenia of 50 × 10^9/L. She had been complaining of breathlessness at rest for the past two months. On physical examination, she has massive splenomegaly down to her right iliac fossa. Blood film examination shows anaemia with teardrop poikilocytosis with no blasts evident. Bone marrow aspiration is unsuccessful, but a trephine biopsy shows infiltration by silver stain positive collagenous strands. Which is the most probable underlying haematological diagnosis?",Acute myeloid leukaemia,Essential thrombocytaemia,Myelodysplasia,Myelofibrosis,Polycythaemia,D,"Primary myelofibrosis is a disorder in which normal bone marrow tissue is gradually replaced with a fibrous scar-like material. Over time this leads to progressive bone marrow failure. It is almost always accompanied by significant splenomegaly and is JAK2 mutation-positive in about 50% of cases. It is generally incurable, although bone marrow transplantation and JAK2 inhibitors have a role in younger patients. Acute myeloid leukaemia would be evidenced by circulating blasts, whereas polycythaemia would show an increased red cell mass. Essential thrombocytaemia is characterised by severely elevated platelet counts, whereas myelodysplasia would show cytopenias but no marrow infiltration by fibrous material. "

What is the most probably diagnosis?",Aplastic anemia,Pernicious anemia,Leukemia,ITP,Lymphoma,B,"It may be graves disease with pernicious anemia. Lemon yellow pallor occurs in pernicious anemia. Both are autoimmune disease which favours this association. Hyperthyroidism may cause persistently raised body temperature, weight loss and diarrhea. In pernicious anemia there is lack of intrinsic factor which is needed to absorb vitamin B12 and as this vitamin is not absorbed in pernicious anemia there occurs macrocytic anemia that leads to high MCV"
hematological system,82,"A 30-year-old lady presents to the Emergency Department with a one-week history of bruising, accompanied by bleeding from her gums and nose. She has no prior medical history, was not admitted to hospital, and takes no medication. Physical examination shows extensive purpura over her extremities, together with wet blisters on her tongue and gums. Blood investigations show a platelet count of 1 × 10^9/L, with normal white cell count, haemoglobin and clotting studies. Bone marrow examination shows normal marrow morphology and the patient is diagnosed with ITP. On the second day of hospital admission the patient complains of severe headache and weakness of the right side of her body. Computed tomography shows an extensive left sided intra-cerebral bleed. What is the most appropriate treatment for ITP in this case?","Combination of IV immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, TPO agent and platelet transfusion",IV corticosteroids only,IV immunoglobulin only,Platelet transfusion,TPO agent only (thrombopoietin agonist),A,"The management of acute ITP with a life threatening bleed is poorly characterised in evidence-based trials due to the ethical considerations. Seeing the patient has a severe intracerebral bleed with probable neurological sequelae, quick normalisation of platelet count is imperative, thus the use of a combination of steroids, IVIg, TPO agonist and platelet concentrate transfusion (in itself not usually efficacious in management of ITP) is imperative. Splenectomy, immunosuppressive agents and the above agents alone all have a role to play in the management of chronic ITP. It is vitally important to recognise a life-threatening bleed early and manage it with all the treatment modalities at hand to normalise the platelet count as expeditiously as possible to curtail bleeding and consequent morbidity and mortality.

hematological system,83,"A 45-year-old woman being treated for acute myeloid leukaemia fails to get sufficient rises with platelet transfusions. She is 14 days post chemotherapy, afebrile and apart from minor bruising is otherwise well. Which of the following would be the next best step in the management of platelet refractoriness?",Avoid further platelet transfusions,Check for a one hour post platelet transfusion platelet count,Continue to monitor for platelet rises with random platelets,Prescribe HLA matched platelets,Request directed platelet donations,B,Patients who are refractory to platelet transfusions should first be investigated to check for adequate platelet rises. This is best done on a one or two hour post platelet transfusion sample. Further management would include checking for HLA antibodies but requesting HLA matched platelets at this stage would not be appropriate. Continuing random platelet transfusions or requesting a directed platelet donation are also not appropriate at this stage. Platelets are obviously indicated in this patient until recovery of blood counts and hence cannot be avoided.
hematological system,84,"A 56-year-old diabetic man presents with an ulcer on the plantar surface of his right foot, at the level of the metatarsal head. Imaging confirms acute osteomyelitis in the metatarsal. Which of the following is correct regarding acute osteomyelitis?",Blood cultures are rarely positive,C-reactive protein changes slowly with the course of the disease,Joint aspiration should never be attempted,MR is the investigation of choice,Plain radiographs lag the clinical picture by 10 days,E,Blood cultures are positive in approximately 50% of patients. CRP is the biochemical parameter of choice to monitor the condition. Plain radiographs are usually normal in the early stages. A three-phase bone scan is the investigation of choice. The diagnosis is confirmed by culturing organisms from aspirated fluid or from operative samples.
hematological system,85,Which of the following investigations is not carried out routinely for a patient with an acute sickle cell crisis?,Bone x ray,Cross match,Cultures,Full blood count,Reticulocyte count,A,Although bone x rays can show bone infection and avascular necrosis they are not done routinely as they will not aid management in the majority of patients presenting with a sickle cell crisis. Full blood count is vital to establish any acute worsening of the patient's anaemia. White cell count may be raised in infection. Reticulocyte count is raised in haemolysis and splenic sequestration and decreased in aplastic crises. Cultures are essential in patients in whom infection is suspected. Cultures will confirm the pathogens present and give sensitivities. Cross matching the patient is important as they may require a blood transfusion.
hematological system,86,A 21-year-old man with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and haemolytic anaemia is assessed for splenectomy. When should Pneumovax vaccine be administered?,At least one week before surgery,At least two weeks before surgery,One week after surgery,One month after surgery,Perioperatively,B,"The vaccine should be given a minimum of two weeks before elective splenectomy in order to ensure an optimal antibody response. In emergency splenectomy, the patient should be immunised seven days after surgery or before discharge from hospital. Unvaccinated patients who have had a splenectomy sometime earlier should be vaccinated at the first opportunity. Vaccination is delayed for at least six months after immunosuppressive chemotherapy or radiotherapy during which time prophylactic antibiotics should be given."
hematological system,87,"A 42 year old female who is currently on warfarin for a DVT presents with acute shortness of breath, haemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain. A CTPA confirms a pulmonary embolus and her INR has been therapeutic. What should be done next?",Maintain target INR and consider life long warfarin,Maintain current warfarin therapy,Increase target INR and continue warfarin for an extra 6 months,Increase target INR to 3.5 and consider life long warfarin,Maintain INR and continue warfarin for an extra 3 months,D,In those with recurrent PTE on warfarin the target INR should be increased and life long anticoagulation should be considered.

EPO is useful for distinguishing between a primary and a secondary polycythaemia.
hematological system,89,A 38 year old male of south eastern Asian descent is found to have a microcytic anaemia. He is asymptomatic. Ferritin and iron studies are normal however a blood film reveals target cells. Which investigation would confirm the diagnosis?,Sickle cell test,Haemoglobin electrophoresis,B12 and folate levels,Ultrasound of the abdomen,Colonoscopy,B,The most likely diagnosis is beta thalassaemia minor given the incidental finding of a microcytic anaemia in an otherwise healthy man of south eastern Asian descent. Haemoglobin electrophoresis will confirm the diagnosis. Iron deficiency is not the cause as iron studies and ferritin are normal. Sickle cell disease normally presents with crises. B12 and folate deficiency lead to a macrocytic anaemia.
hematological system,90,A patient with Rheumatoid arthritis is found to have a pancytopenia. She has been stable on her medication for many years. On examination there is evidence of splenomegaly. What Is the most likely diagnosis?,Medication related,Aplastic anaemia,Feltys syndrome,Myelodysplasia,B12 deficiency,C,Given the history of RA and the evidence of splenomegaly then the most likely cause is Feltys syndrome. Medication leading to a pancytopenia is less likely given the history of the stability on these drugs. Aplastic anaemia is less likely as there is splenomegaly and the diagnosis can not be made until there is a bone marrow biopsy.
hematological system,91,Which of the following is the minimum dataset for identifying a patient and a sample for purpose of a non-emergency blood transfusion?,The full name and gender,"The full name, date of birth and patient identity number","The full name, gender, address and patient identity number","The full name, gender and patient identity number","The full name, gender, previous blood grouping details, address and patient identity number",B,"Given that the largest number of errors and near misses occur because of mislabelling or mistaken identity of patient or the sample, a minimum data set is prescribed for transfusion requests. This involves recording the:  Full name Date of birth Patient identity number, and Address (in some areas, such as Wales).  Previous blood grouping details are not required and missing elements of this minimum dataset are not acceptable in the transfusion service. "
hematological system,92,"Regarding osteomyelitis, which of the following is correct?",Infection usually involves the metaphysis of long bones,Forming new bone beneath the periosteum is known as the sequestrum,Is always associated with a soft tissue reaction,Is known as involucrum when dead bone occurs within the medullary canal,Is most commonly due to Streptococcus infection,A,"Osteomyelitis is usually due to Staphylococcus aureus infection. Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilis influenzae and Gram negative organisms can also infect bone, causing osteomyelitis. In children, the infection is usually acquired by haematogenous spread to the metaphysis of long bones. The dead bone within the medullary canal is the sequestrum. New subperiosteal bone formation is the involucrum."
hematological system,93,"A 25 year old female has been commenced on nitrofurantoin for a urinary tract infection. She notices that her urine has become dark and her sclera are yellow. Her bloods reveal evidence of a haemolytic anaemia, with a low haemoglobin, elevated reticulocyte count, LDH and bilirubin. A blood film reveal Heinz bodies and bite cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Pyruvate kinase deficiency,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria,Drug induced haemolytic anaemia,Hereditary Spherocytosis,A,"The most likely diagnosis is G6PD. G6P is required for the pentose phosphate pathway and NADPH and subsequent glutathione production, which protects red cells from oxidative damage. Most people are unaware of there diagnosis however there are certain triggers which precipitate a haemolytic crisis which includes nitrofurantoin and quinolones, primaquine, dapsone, sulphonylureas and aspirin. Favism is a haemolytic crisis caused by the consumption of broad beans. Investigations will show evidence of haemolytic anaemia such as low haptoglobin, elevated bilirubin and increased reticulocyte. Heinz bodies and bite and blister cells are seen on blood film."

He has also noticed dried and cracked skin at the corners of his mouth and a pigmented scaly rash on the back of his hands and neck. He has also been depressed and is having problems with his memory. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Iron deficiency,Progression of carcinoid,Thiamine deficiency,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Vitamin B3 deficiency,E,"In metastatic carcinoid tumours there is increased conversion of tryptophan to serotonin which can lead to tryptophan and niacin deficiency.  Niacin/ vitamin B3 deficiency may lead to pellagra which ,may present as is the case here with the classical triad of diarrhoea, dermatitis and dementia."
hematological system,95,Which of the following is true about manufacture of pooled plasma derivatives?,Pooled plasma is often sourced from within the UK,The end product is a freeze dried product,The process does not involve any viral inactivation steps,These are usually manufactured from 10 donors at a time,"These products have a short half life, typically days",B,"The plasma derivatives (such as factor VIII) are prepared from several thousand plasma donations, typically 20,000, or 5,000 kg of plasma at a time. Pooled plasma has been sourced from outside UK since 1999 to avoid vCJD risks. The process involves several chemical steps including ethanol extraction, chromatography and viral inactivation steps which results in a freeze dried product. These products have a long shelf life of several months to years.    "
hematological system,96,A 35-year-old 1st time donor suddenly passes out as she is donating blood. Which of the following steps would be least useful in managing this adverse event?,Ensure donor is adequately hydrated and has not skipped a meal,Elevating the donor's legs as this is usually due to a vasovagal syncope,Haemoglobin of the donor meets the minimum requirement for donation,The donation is usually continued along with simultaneous normal saline infusion.,The donor should be encouraged to mobilise after they have recovered,C,If syncope then we can continue donation giving simultaneous normal saline to the donor.(option D). Option C. Haemoglobin of the donour meets the minimum requirement for donation as it is routinely done in every doner prior to donation and therefore this has no impact on syncope
hematological system,97,A 60-year-old lady with bruising is investigated and found to have the following full blood count:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 6.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 15 ×10^9/L (150-400)    She refuses to give consent to a bone marrow biopsy. What is the most appropriate management plan?,Intravenous immunoglobulin,No treatment,Oral prednisolone,Platelet transfusion,Splenectomy,C,"This lady most likely has idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. The history should highlight any drug causes (not mentioned here) and a blood film would help exclude leukaemia. A bone marrow examination is useful to rule out an underlying lymphoproliferative condition but is not needed urgently.  Platelet transfusion would not be useful and is only indicated in bleeding with ITP. No treatment is often an option but this lady is older and has bruising. Given the circumstances, the best management plan is to treat with steroid."
hematological system,98,In aplastic anaemia what would you expect to see on a bone marrow biopsy?,Hypercellular bone marrow,Hypercellular bone marrow with fatty infiltration,Hypocellular bone marrow with fatty infiltration,Hypocellular bone marrow with numerous blast cells,Fibrous Infiltration,C,Aplastic anaemia is characterised by hypocellular bone marrow where some of the normal marrow is replaced by fatty marrow.
hematological system,99,"A 35 year old female presents with fatigue, aches and pains, night sweats and pruritus. She also has diarrhoea, shortness of breath and a dry cough. Bloods reveal a markedly elevated eosinophil count, thrombocytopenia and elevated ESR. There is no clear evidence to suggest allergies, asthma or parasitic infection and a bone marrow biopsy does not suggest malignancy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Hypereosinophilic syndrome,Eosinophil malignancy,Asthma,Parasitic Infection,Allergic alveolitis,A,The most likely diagnosis is hypereosinophilic syndrome which is characterised by elevated eosinophil count and associated organ damage. All other causes of eosinophilia must be excluded. Organ damage is evidenced here by the dry cough and shortness of breath suggesting pneumonitis and thrombocytopenia. Corticosteroids are utilised as first line management. Hydroxyurea and interferon alpha as second line and Imatinib as third line.
hematological system,100,"A 28 year old female presents feeling very tired, short of breath on exertion and palpitations for the last few days. She has recently had a course of cefalexin for a Urinary tract infection. She is otherwise normally fit and well. On examination the patient looks pale and the sclerae appear yellow. She is tachycardic. Bloods reveal a low haemoglobin with a high reticulocyte count and evidence of spherocytes on the blood film. Her bilirubin was elevated (majority being unconjugated) but the rest of her LFTs were normal and her LDH was elevated. A direct Coombs test was positive.",Cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Warm autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Hereditary spherocytosis,Drug induced immune haemolytic anaemia,Gallstones,D,"This patient has most likely developed a drug induced haemolytic anaemia. Cephalosporins have been associated with a hapten reaction and lead to haemolytic anaemia. Haemolytic anaemia is evidenced by the reduced haemoglobin, increased reticulocyte count, increased LDH, increased unconjugated bilirubin and reduced haptoglobin. Spherocytes and fragmented red cells can appear on blood film. Direct Coombs test is positive. Warm and cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia could also be indicated as the cause (cold more so as this leads to intravascular haemolysis) however as there is clear history of a drug cause and the patient is otherwise well then these are less likely as they tend to be secondary to other autoimmune diseases, infection or malignancy."
hematological system,101,"A 21 year old female presents with increased frequency of nose bleeds. She has also noticed easy bruising and bleeding from her gums. Bloods reveal a slightly low haemoglobin, normal white cell count and platelets of 15. Blood film confirm thrombocytopenia with the platelets which are present being large in size. She is otherwise fit and well and is n no medications. There is nil of note on examination. What is the most likely diagnosis?",von Willebrands disease,Aplastic anaemia,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Drug related thrombocytopenia,Leukaemia,C,This history and clinical findings is highly indicative of ITP. There is no other medical or drug history making it unlikely to be drug related. In aplastic anaemia and leukaemia you would expect to find other abnormal findings in the blood. In Von willebrands you would not expect there to be low platelets.  ITP is thought to be an autoimmune process where there is immunological destruction of platelets.  It can be acute (most often in childhood) where it often is post viral and self resolves or chronic which occur in adults. In 80% of chronic ITP there is platelet membrane (usually GP IIb/IIIa) autoantibodies found. Patients can be asymptomatic or present as in this case or with severe haemorrhage. Spontaneous haemorrhage does not usually occur until platelets are less than 20. Steroids are useful as a first line management. IVIg is also considered and may be utilised if steroids are contraindicated. If this fails then splenectomy should be considered. Other immunosuppressives such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine  can also be considered.

hematological system,104,A 55-year-old asymptomatic woman with mild splenomegaly was found to have a platelet count of 650 ×10^9/L (150-400) on blood investigation. White blood cells and haemoglobin are within the normal range. What is the next step in management?,Anagrelide,Hydroxycarbamide,Low dose aspirin,Observation,Plateletpheresis,D,"In essential thrombocytosis low-risk patients have a risk of thrombosis similar to that of the age and sex-matched population and a very low risk of life-threatening bleeding, supporting close observation as the most sensible approach. Hydroxycarbamide is an adequate choice for patients 60 years of age or older who are otherwise in good health. For elderly patients with limited projected survival (less than 10 years) and who have problems with other drug compliance, 32P administration might be appropriate. Anagrelide should be offered to younger patients (less than 60) who are at high risk by virtue of a prior history of thrombosis. In patients who suffer from thrombotic episodes, especially episodes involving the microcirculation or large vessels, low-dose aspirin or anticoagulation is usually administered."
hematological system,105,Which of the following is not associated with a poor prognosis in Hodgkins lymphoma?,High ESR,Young age,Presence of B symptoms,Lymphocyte depleted disease,Lymphopenia,B,"Young age is associated with a better prognosis. Advanced stages of the disease, lymphocyte depleted pathology, presence of B symptoms, high ESR and lymphopenia are all associated with a poorer prognosis. Being male and having a low haemoglobin and albumin is also associated with a worse prognosis."
hematological system,106,"A 10-year-old boy presents to his GP with a three-day history of malaise, fever, headache, myalgia, and nausea. The symptoms resolve with conservative treatment but within a week the boy presents again, this time to the Emergency Department with pallor, fatigue, and breathlessness. His blood investigations show a haemoglobin of 30 g/L, a platelet count of 15 × 10^9/L, and a white cell count of 2 × 10^9/L. Parvovirus B19 (erythrovirus) specific IgM by ELISA and viral DNA by PCR were both detected in high titre. Which is the underlying mechanism of this complication?",Aplastic anaemia due to direct cytotoxic effect on erythropoiesis,Cytopenias due to consumption,Molecular mimicry by virus antigen,Nutritional deficiency,Raised cytokine,A,"It is known that parvovirus B19 plays a distinctive role in aplastic crises due to its direct cytotoxic effect on haemopoietic progenitors. The cellular receptor responsive for the entry of the virus is an antigen of the group blood P, which is present not only on erythrocytes and erythroblasts but also on megakaryocytes and granulocytes, resulting in the progenitors being killed by the cytotoxic effect of the virus load and the reticulocytes being cleared by the reticuloendothelial system. The patients most at risk are those already having a bone marrow disorder resulting in decreased or functionally abnormal haemoglobin production, such as haemoglobinopathies. "

What is the most appropriatenext step?",IV insulin,IV calcium gluconate,IV fluids,IV bisphosphonates,Oral bisphosphonates,C,Multiple myeloma itself is a cause of vomiting and also associated hypercalcemia can cause sickness. As the patient is vomiting for 2 days there may be considerable dehydration and also the hypercalcemia needs treatment with IV fluid
hematological system,108,"A 70-year-old female presents with a three-month history of exertional dyspnoea and chest pain. She admitted to a poor diet, some vague abdominal pains and having lost 7 kg in weight. Examination revealed pallor, patches of vitiligo on her arms and trunk, ankle oedema, and a palpable spleen. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 50 g/L (115-165)   MCV 105 fL (80-96)   White cell count 2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 50 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Bilirubin 40 µmol/L (1-22)   ALT 60 U/L (1-31)   AST 40 U/L (5-35)   LDH 1000 U/L (10-250)    Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aplastic anaemia,Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Dietary folate deficiency,Pernicious anaemia,Sideroblastic anaemia,D,"There is pancytopenia with anaemia being more significant. The anaemia is macrocytic. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is very high with some derangement of liver function tests (LFTs). Aplastic anaemia would cause pancytopenia but not a raised LDH. Autoimmune haemolysis and sideroblastic anaemia would not cause pancytopenia. Folate deficiency and pernicious anaemia would both cause the above results; the LDH is elevated due to ineffective erythropoiesis and likewise the deranged LFTs. Pernicious anaemia is more likely given the history of other autoimmune disease. Of note, with such a low haemoglobin one would expect a much higher mean corpuscular volume (MCV); but sometimes when the deficiency is severe, the red cell anisopoikilocytosis causes a lower MCV. Thrombotic thormbocytopaenic purpura (TTP) is a rare haematological disorder and emergency which sshould be ruled out when conisdering a case of anaemia and thormbocytopaenia, though the symptoms do not fit with such a case in this instance."
hematological system,109,A patient on a medical ward received a transfusion 48 hours ago for symptomatic anaemia on a background of chronic renal disease and obstructive airways disease. He gives a history of previous transfusions in the last year. The patient has now dropped his Hb by 20 g/L compared to his pretransfusion level and reports a dark coloured urine. The LDH and bilirubin are elevated. Which of the following is this most likely to represent?,Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction,Acute hepatitis as an infective complication,Delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction,Non-haemolytic febrile transfusion reaction,Transfusion related graft versus host disease,C,This case is an example of delayed haemolytic transfusion reaction which occurs 24 hours after the transfusion. This happens in a patient who has been previously immunised by transfusions or pregnancy. The antibodies are not detectable initially but become obvious as a secondary immune response to the antigen exposure during the transfusion occurs. The following should be carried out:  A haemoglobin level Blood film LDH Direct antiglobulin test Renal profile Serum bilirubin Haptoglobin Urinalysis for haemoglobinuria.  The group and antibody screen should be repeated. A transfusion-associated graft versus host disease and an acute hepatitis are unlikely given the time frame - both would be expected to occur in a week or two. This is also not an acute haemolysis which would be expected to occur during the transfusion. Given the rise in bilirubin and LDH this is a haemolytic reaction.

hematological system,111,A 17-year-old male with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency presents with tiredness and is noticed to be jaundiced. These features have developed since he developed a mild chest infection one week ago. Which one of the following is the most likely finding?,Haemoglobinuria ,Low mean cell volume,Positive direct antiglobulin test,Reduced reticulocyte count,Spherocytes present on blood film ,A,"G6PD deficiency is a red cell enzymopathy that can lead to acute intravascular haemolysis after exposure to certain drugs, infection, etc. You would, therefore, get haemoglobinuria but would not get a positive direct antiglobulin test. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and reticulocyte count would be high due to haemolysis. There is a form of G6PD deficiency where there is a chronic low-level haemolysis where there are spherocytes seen, but the clinical information points to intravascular haemolysis after an infection. Often the MCV will be normal or raised and a DAT will be negative as this is not an autoimmune process. Reticulocyte count will often be high and blood film findings will show bite cells more commonly in cases of oxidative stress."
hematological system,112,Which RBC antigen is involved in the entry of P. vivax into red blood cells?,Anti-D,Anti-S,Duffy,Kell,Kidd,C,The Duffy antigen receptor facilitates the entry of P. vivax into the red blood cells and Duffy negative individuals are therefore resistant to this strain. A similar situation exists with P. ovale but Duffy negative offers slightly less protection. Anti-D is a significant cause of haemolyic disease of the newborn and fetus (HDFN) Anti-S and Kell may also cause HDFN but to a lesser degree than D. Anti-Kidd antibodies are responsible for delayed transfusion reactions.
hematological system,113,"A 4-year-old boy presents with recurrent episodes of self limiting spontaneous bleeding. Coagulation test: PT normal, bleeding time normal, APTT prolonged, Factor VIII decreased. His father and uncle suffer from a similar illness. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hemophilia A,Hemophilia B,Von willebrand’s disease,ITP,TTP,A,"Prolonged APTT and decreased factor VIII points towards the diagnosis of hemophilia A. In hemophilia B there is factor IX deficiency. Haemophilia A is a genetic deficiency in clotting factor VIII, which causes increased bleeding and usually affects males. In the majority of cases it is inherited as an X-linked recessive trait"
hematological system,114,A 20-year-old lady is referred after complaining of a longstanding history of heavy menstrual bleeding. On further history taking it is elucidated that she had sustained bleeding when she had two molar teeth extracted at the age of 14 and she gets repeated nosebleeds with no preceding trauma. What is the most probable clotting deficiency this patient suffers from?,Acquired von Willebrand disease,Factor XII deficiency,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,"von Willebrand disease, type 1",E,"Haemophilia A and haemophilia B present with significant bleeding in infancy due to lack of the relevant factors (factor VIII and factor IX). Factor XII deficiency has no clinical sequelae. Acquired von Willebrand disease tends to occur later in life and is associated with thyroid and endocrine dysfunction. The bleeding post trauma aged 14 with ongoing history until 20 is against the development of acute antibodies in acquired von Willebrand disease. Type 1 von Willebrand disease is the most common subtype of von Willebrand disease, with the typical mild bleeding, menorrhagia, and bleeding post procedure described above. von Willebrand disease (vWD) is a relatively common inherited, genetically and clinically heterogeneous clotting disorder caused by a deficiency or dysfunction of the protein termed von Willebrand factor (vWF). Consequently, defective vWF interaction between platelets and the vessel wall impairs primary haemostasis. It is diagnosed by taking a detailed clotting history, together with von Willebrand factor assay, ristocetin cofactor activity, PT, aPTT, and factor VIII activity, using genetic studies in difficult complex cases.

hematological system,116,"A 72-year-old man comes to the haematology clinic for review. He has suffered increasing tiredness over the past four to six months, intermittent night sweats and abdominal fullness which is limiting his ability to finish a meal. As a consequence of this he has lost 4kg in weight. He has a history of inferior myocardial infarction and asthma, for which he takes ramipril, indapamide, atorvastatin, aspirin and seretide. On examination his BP is 145/85, pulse is 84 and regular. He looks pale and there is hepatosplenomegaly on abdominal palpation. His BMI is 23. Investigations:    Hb 88 g/l (tear drop poikilocytes, nucleated red cells on film) (135-180)   WCC 7.2 x10^9/l (6-10)   PLT 155 x 10^9/l (150-400)   Na 136 mmol/l (135-145)   K 4.0 mmol/l (3.5-5.5)   Cr 112 µmol/l (50-110)   Glucose 5.9 mmol/l (less than7.0)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute myeloid leukaemia,Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,B12 deficiency,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Myelofibrosis,E,"The answer is myelofibrosis. Teardrop poikilocytes are said to be characteristic of myelofibrosis, and the anaemia with hepatosplenomegaly and gradually worsening symptoms of lethargy and night sweats over the past few months support the diagnosis. Platelet and white cell abnormalities are variably seen, with marked elevation in white cells seen in 10-15% of patients. Abnormalities in LFTs, particularly alkaline phosphatase, and urate with increased risk of gout are also seen. Treatment is tailored by risk stratification used to estimate overall survival, and by comorbidities which affect ability to tolerate chemotherapy intervention. Acute myeloid leukaemia is incorrect as you would expect a significantly raised white cell count, with blasts present on blood film. Myelofibrosis can transform to AML, and therefore patients should be monitored for this. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia is usually associated with macrocytosis because of increased reticulocyte count, and hepatosplenomegaly would be less characteristic. B12 deficiency is associated with macrocytosis, and not with the blood film abnormalities seen here or hepatosplenomegaly. CML can present with a similar clinical picture to that seen here, but tear drop poikilocytes are not characteristic."
hematological system,117,An 84-year-old man was referred for investigation of anaemia. He had been feeling weak and lethargic. His past medical history included diverticular disease and duodenal ulcer. Investigations showed:    Haemoglobin 72 g/L (130 - 180)   WBC 4.8 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelets 182 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   MCV 112 fL (80 - 96)   Iron 32 µmol/L (12 - 30)   TIBC 70 µmol/L (45 - 75)   Serum folate 24 nmol/L (2 - 11)   Serum B12 270 pmol/L (160 - 760)   TSH 3.4 mU/L (0.4 - 5.0)   LDH 200 U/L (10 - 250)   Blood film dimorphic picture   Bone marrow aspirate generalised increase in iron stores   Faecal occult blood negative    Which of the following is the correct diagnosis?,Gastrointestinal blood loss,Haemolytic anaemia,Iron deficiency anaemia,Megaloblastic anaemia,Sideroblastic anaemia,E,"Sideroblastic anaemia is a condition in which the bone marrow produces atypical nucleated erythroblasts with granules of iron accumulated in the perinuclear membrane (sideroblasts). There is inability of iron utilisation, resulting in disordered haem synthesis and hence microcytic hypochromic cells and diamorphic blood film. Sideroblastic anaemia is most often associated with myelodysplastic syndromes, but can also be inherited. In addition, can occur in other bone marrow conditions including myeloma, polycythaemia rubra vera and leukaemia. Secondary causes include rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, chronic infections and hypothyroidism. Clinical features are those related to anaemia (and or cytopenia). Diagnosis requires bone marrow examination, which shows ring sideroblasts and increased iron stores. Full blood count shows anaemia, with a normal or increased MCV. Serum iron and transferrin saturation are usually high, and the blood film shows a dimorphic population of normal and hypochromic red blood cells. Total iron binding capacity is usually normal. Treatment is in general supportive, or of the underlying condition. Transfusion can be considered, with care to avoid iron overload. Gastrointestinal blood loss and iron deficiency anaemia are unlikely because of normal serum iron and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) and negative faecal occult blood. A normal lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) means haemolytic anaemia is unlikely. Megaloblastic anaemia is a broad term, often caused by vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Blood film shows macrocytes with hypersegmented polymorphs."
hematological system,118,"A 72-year-old man presents to the haematology clinic. He has suffered increasing headaches over the past few weeks, and unfortunately suffered a myocardial infarction some four weeks ago. He has been buying anti-histamines over the counter because of increasing itching. During his admission it was noted that he had a marked elevation in haemoglobin, white cells and platelets. He is a non-smoker with no history of chest disease. On examination in the clinic today he is hypertensive with a BP of 155/90 mmHg. Heart sounds are normal and his chest is clear.

It is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase which is responsible for signal transduction of haemopoietic growth factors, including erythropoietin. JAK2 mutation is a primary event in the development of primary polycythaemia, with homozygosity for the mutation conferring a proliferative advantage for the cells concerned. Treatment is with Hydorxycarbamide and aspirin first line though JAK inhibitors such as Ruxolitonib exist for treatment of MPN such as Myelofibrosis with severe disease or symptomatic splenomegaly."
hematological system,119,"A 16-year-old girl of African origin presents to the Emergency Department with a one-week history fever and lethargy. Shortly before developing her symptoms she received a course of antibiotics from her GP for an upper respiratory infection. She also complains of two to three days of pain and swelling in her hands. The patient tells you that she has had similar attacks before. On examination she is pyrexial, with a heart rate of 109 and oxygen saturations of 91% on air. There is painful dactylitis of both her hands. The remainder of her examination was normal. Initial investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 93 g/L (115-165)   Reticulocytes 8% (0.5-2.4)   White cell count 13 ×10^9/L (4-11)    ECG, urinalysis and electrolytes are normal. C-reactive protein is 76. You decide to treat the patient as a sickle cell crisis. Which treatment would you start in the Emergency Department?",Analgesia,Analgesia and oxygen,"Analgesia, oxygen and hydration","Analgesia, oxygen, hydration, and antibiotics","Analgesia, oxygen, hydration, antibiotics, and hydroxycarbamide",D,"The correct management of a sickle cell crisis would entail oxygenation, hydration with careful management of fluid balance, analgesia, predominantly based on opioids, and blood product support, including if required exchange transfusion to get the HbS fraction to less than 30%. HbF switching therapies such as hydroxycarbamide are not instituted acutely. Analgesia: start with paracetamol and then add in a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, for example, ibuprofen. If this does not control the pain then opioid analgesics should be used, for example, morphine sulphate. Often patients can give you information regarding which analgesics work for them. Oxygen: the patient is hypoxic and will benefit from oxygen therapy. A rate of 2 L/min given via a nasal cannula should be started. Hydration: This is important to correct any intravascular depletion. Oral fluid therapy may be sufficient but if the patient is severely dehydrated or intravenous therapy is required because they are unable to take oral fluids.  Antibiotics: Antibiotics should be started if there is evidence of infection, for example, green sputum, positive urinalysis, pyrexia, or raised inflammatory markers. Start with broad spectrum antibiotics and rationalise once sensitivities become available. Hydroxycarbamide (and bone marrow transplantation) have roles to play in the management of sickle cell disease but they are not used in the acute setting. Blood transfusion in this patient should be considered as she is anaemic with a raised reticulocyte count but you must also take into account the clinical condition of the patient."
hematological system,120,A 23-year-old male presents with a deep vein thrombosis (DVT). He has no past medical history but his mother has suffered from deep vein thromboses. Which of the following is likely to be found on haematological assessment?,Antithrombin deficiency,Factor V (FV) Leiden mutation,Lupus anticoagulant,Protein C deficiency,Protein S deficiency,B,"The unprovoked venous thromboembolic event in a young patient with a positive family history should make you consider the presence of an inherited coagulopathy. Factor V leiden mutation (also known as activated protein C resistance) is the commonest inherited coagulopathy, and results in a 30% lifetime risk of VTE for homozygotes and 5-10% for heterozygotes. It is caused by an amino acid substitution that impairs the ability of activated protein C and S to inactivate factor Va. It is mostly inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is present in 5-9% of the European population but is rare in people of Asian and African descent. Antithombin III deficiency impairs the body's ability to inactivate factors Xa, IXa, VIIa and plasmin. It results in a 70-90% lifetime risk of thromboembolism, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. Protein C and S deficiencies are very rare. Lupus anticoagulant is again rarer than factor V leiden. It is an immunoglobulin that binds to membrane phospholipids and proteins resulting in thrombotic tendencies. It can be present in patients who do not have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)."

They are painful, red, and about 3 cm in diameter, noted by her GP to be over the extensor aspect of the legs only. Her only medical history of note is that she has been commenced on the oral contraceptive pill about a month prior to presentation to control irregular menses. What is the most probable underlying pathophysiology?",Deep vein thrombosis,Erysipelas,Erythema nodosum,Superficial thrombophlebitis,Urticaria,C,"The presentation is typical of the nodular lesions of erythema nodosum, made all the more probable by a known inciting factor in the oral contraceptive pill. Erythema nodosum (EN) is an acute, nodular, erythematous eruption that usually is limited to the extensor aspects of the lower legs. It is presumed to be a hypersensitivity reaction in the subcutaneous panniculus and may occur in association with several systemic diseases, infections or drug therapies, as well as being idiopathic. Causes include:  tuberculosis inflammatory bowel disease streptococcal infection pregnancy drugs (penicillin, sulphonamides, oral contraceptive pill), and sarcoidosis.  Erysipelas and superficial thrombophlebitis tend to cause less discrete, more extensive lesions. Deep vein thrombosis would usually be unilateral swelling of the lower limb, which can be accompanied by pain. Urticaria causes characteristic wheals and flares not present in this case. "

MGUS is the presence of low-level paraprotein with no end organ damage. Osteoporosis and hypoparathyroidism do not fit with the biochemical profile described or the clinical presentation. The development of myeloma ROTI excludes asymptomatic myeloma as a diagnosis. Multiple myeloma may present insidiously with just a monoclonal paraprotein and normochromic normocytic anaemia, although hypercalcaemia, bone lesions and renal impairment should raise red flags about an underlying plasma cell disorder.

Hereditary or acquired angio-oedema is unlikely given the normal C4 and the history occurs late. Also, the patient herself has noticed a link with food; food allergy is usually easier to diagnose in adults. The cosmetics (chemical intolerance) are unlikely and the clinical history does not fit mastocytosis."
hematological system,125,The mother of a 16-year-old boy with sickle cell disease comes to your practice and asks for advice with regard to the vaccination requirements of her son.

All adults who are hyposplenic, including patients with sickle cell disease, need:  yearly influenza vaccine pneumococcal C vaccine, (adults and children over 2 years) repeated every five years haemophilus influenzae type b; if not already given as part of childhood immunisation conjugated meningococcal C vaccine; if not already given as part of childhood immunisation, and meningococcal ACWY vaccine; if travelling to areas with high risk of meningitis.  Patients with sickle cell disease are hyposplenic, and have additional lifelong requirements. All hyposplenic patients should be offered meningococcal ACWY vaccine if travelling to areas at high risk of meningitis. Meningococcal C vaccine is a part of primary immunisation schedule which this young boy should have had already. Had this young boy not been up to date with his childhood immunisation schedule, then he should have a single dose. Although patients with sickle cell disease do need the yearly influenza vaccination, they also need five yearly Pneumovax. This young boy is up to date with his immunisation and therefore should not need additional meningococcal C vaccination."

The patient has a history of taking ibuprofen which is an oxidant and causes haemolysis in patients with G-6-PD deficiency. Oxidative stressors can be infectious agents, drugs, chemicals and certain legumes. In G-6-PD deficient patients, oxidative stress exposes interior sulfhydryl groups that are oxidised and cannot be reduced, leading to irreversible denaturation of the haemoglobin with Heinz body formation. Schistocytes are red blood cell fragments that result from membrane damage. They are sometimes referred to as 'bite cells'."
hematological system,127,A 69-year-old male presents with tiredness and dyspnoea and is diagnosed with acute myeloid leukaemia. Which of the following is the most important prognostic factor?,Elevated lactate dehydrogenase activity,Karyotype of bone marrow,Monocytic morphology,Number of blasts in bone marrow,White cell count at diagnosis,B,"White cell count at diagnosis is important but most important is the karyotype of bone marrow, as this result stratifies patients into lower risk, standard risk, and poor risk, which has prognostic significance. Other important invesitgations to help stratify risk include molecular mutations which can also aid in treatment decisions. Those with standard or poor risk AML should be considered for allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplant in their first complete remission.

There is also mild swelling of the feet. On examination, there was decreased sensation to all modalities in both lower limbs up to mid-calf. What is the most likely cause for this complaint?",Cisplatin,Critical illness polyneuropathy,Cyclophosphamide,Lymphomatous infiltration of nerves,Vincristine,E,"Therapy for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) usually consists of R-CHOP: rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone. Of these, vincristine is notorious for causing peripheral neuropathy. It is predominantly a sensory neuropathy, although motor components may also be found. It starts distally and progresses proximally. It is very difficult to treat this neuropathy unless alternative drugs can be used. Cisplatin is also another chemotherapeutic agent which causes peripheral neuropathy. But it is not used in NHL. It is mainly used in solid tumours. Critical illness polyneuropathy occurs in patients admitted to the ICU with multi-organ failure. So, this is not the clinical setting for critical illness polyneuropathy. Cyclophosphamide is not known to cause peripheral neuropathy. It causes infertility and cystitis. In NHL, lymphomatous infiltration of the nerves may occur and it may lead to neuropathy. This is very rare and it can improve after therapy. So, in this clinical setting, vincristine is more likely an answer than lymphomatous neuropathy."

Which of the following would be contraindications to performing this procedure?,A haemoglobin concentration of 99 g/L (NR 115-155),A platelet count of 140 ×10^9 (NR 150-400),Age,An INR of 1.5,Extra-hepatic biliary obstruction,E,"Contraindications to percutaneous liver biopsy include:  Bacterial cholangitis, because of the risk of causing peritonitis or septic shock. A platelet count below 80,000/mm^3 (there is no absolute agreed lower level: 50,000^3 may be acceptable. Platelet function is more important than absolute numbers (e.g. need to stop clopidogrel a week before the procedure) A deranged INR above 1.5 (this value is debatable as 90% of bleeds occur in patients with an INR less than1.3) Haemangioma, because of the risk of bleeding. Bile duct obstruction increases the risk of biliary peritonitis.  Age is not a contraindication, however, patient co-operation is required for the procedure, and so other factors, such as dementia and severe obesity, need to be taken into consideration. Contraindications are relative rather than absolute. Individual risk has to be assessed."
hematological system,132,"A 20-year-old Caucasian student returns from Ghana with a spiking temperature and nocturnal sweats. She has 0.5% of red blood cells infected with Plasmodium falciparum. Which of the following is correct, as it relates to quinine therapy in this case?",Glucose levels should be monitored in those being treated with quinine,Pregnancy is a contraindication for quinine,Quinine is contraindicated in those taking mefloquine prophylactically,Quinine must always be given parenterally initially,The dose of quinine should be reduced in liver impairment,A,"Severe malaria is indicated by more than 1% of RBC infected. Hypoglycaemia is an important side effect of quinine therapy and should be monitored in those having intravenous quinine. Intravenous infusion of quinine is reserved for severe or cerebral malaria (most deaths from M. falciparum occur in first 96 hours of starting treatment). The initial dose should NOT be reduced in those severely ill with renal/hepatic impairment. High doses of quinine in pregnancy are teratogenic in the first trimester. However, in malaria, the benefit of treatment outweighs the risk. WHO Guidelines (2006) recommend artemisinins are the first line in the second and third trimester. In the first trimester, both artesunate and quinine are considered treatment options. In severe malaria, any available treatment should be started without delay as both the mother and foetus' life are in danger."
hematological system,133,A 51-year-old woman is undergoing a cervical lymph node biopsy for a suspected lymphoma. Which of the following is correct with regard to Hodgkin's disease?,It is associated with hirsutism,It is best treated with radiotherapy when there is marrow involvement,It is characterised by the Reed-Sternberg cell,It is more common in females than males,It most frequently involves the hilar lymph nodes,C,"The incidence of males to females is roughly 1.9:1. Histologically it is characterised by the Reed-Sternberg cell, a giant multinucleated cell. It most frequently involves the cervical lymph nodes, is associated with typical symptoms - night sweats, weight loss and pruritus. Marrow involvement which is prognostically poor is most appropriately treated with chemotherapy. "
hematological system,134,A patient with AML develops jaundice and spiking pyrexia three weeks into induction chemotherapy. The patient remained pyrexial after seven days of intravenous antibiotics. What is the likely diagnosis?,CMV ,Fungal infection ,Hepatic leukaemic deposits ,Miliary TB ,Toxoplasmosis ,A,"The most likely cause for the persisting pyrexia plus hepatitis in this immunocompromised patient treated with appropriate antibiotics would be a Cytomegalovirus infection. Fungal infection would not be expected to cause the jaundice, but again may be responsible for the pyrexia. TB would be most unlikely and hepatic infiltration would not be expected to produce this pyrexia. Leukaemic deposits in organs, especially in AML, are incredibly rare.  "
hematological system,135,A 22-year-old woman presents to the haematology clinic for review. She has been referred by her GP after a significant bleeding episode at the dentist following a wisdom tooth extraction. She tells you that her uncle and sister have also had problems with bleeding at the dentist in the past. Routine blood screening has been entirely normal apart from mild iron deficiency anaemia and a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 38 seconds (25-40). Clinical examination in the clinic is entirely normal. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Factor X deficiency,Factor XI deficiency,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,Von Willebrand disease,E,"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most likely diagnosis here. VWD type 1 makes up 60-80% of cases and is associated with mild bleeding only. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It is associated with a quantitative reduction of between 19% and 45% of VW factor (VWF). Type 2 is associated with a qualitative defect in VWF, and bleeding tendency varies between patients. Type 3 is autosomal recessive, associated with much more severe bleeding, and with very low/undetectable levels of VWF. DDAVP is the initial treatment of choice for patients with VWD type 1. Other therapies such as factor VIII concentrates containing VWF are not usually required. Haemophilia A and B are possible alternative diagnoses, although they are inherited in an X-linked recessive fashion, and as such females are not normally affected (although APTT may be prolonged in asymptomatic carriers). Although factor XI deficiency (haemophilia C) results in prolongation of APTT, it only makes up 5% of bleeding disorders, as such it is very unlikely to be the cause here. Factor X deficiency is among the rarest of bleeding disorders, and both PT and APTT are prolonged in sufferers."
hematological system,136,"A 50-year-old male who is well known to the Emergency Department attends inebriated. He has an alcoholic encephalopathy with a Glasgow coma scale of 13. He is jaundiced, describes no symptoms, but is mildly short of breath. You are presented with his blood results:    Haemoglobin 74 g/L (120-160)   White cell count 10.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 137 ×10^9/L (140-400)   Sodium 133 mmol/L (133-144)   Potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 12 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 113 μmol/L (60-110)   AST 124 U/L (5-35)   Alkaline Phosphatase 224 U/L (45-105)   Total Protein 54 g/L (60-80)   Bilirubin 63 μmol/L (1-22)   Cholesterol 15.3 mmol/L (less than5.5)   Triglycerides 7.2 mmol/L (less than2.2)   Blood film Profound spherocytosis    Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management for this patient?",IV steroids,MRI pancreas,Oesophagogastroduodenoscopy,Supportive therapy,Urgent laporotomy,D,"A combination of jaundice, alcoholic hepatitis, hyperlipidaemia, and haemolysis is known as Zieve's syndrome. There is no specific treatment for Zieve's syndrome but supportive therapy is indicated which includes:  correction of clotting abnormalities treatment of haemolysis treating alcohol withdrawal preventing further alcohol intake, and adequate nutrition.  The spherocytosis is the result of the haemolysis. Pancreatitis is a possible differential diagnosis here but in the first instance, one would request an amylase rather than an MRI of the pancreas."
hematological system,137,"A 3-year-old child is admitted to hospital due to loose bowel motions with no fresh or altered blood, fever, and vomiting. Escherichia coli subtype O157:H7 is cultured from his stool. With adequate resuscitation, he makes an uneventful recovery and is discharged home after seven days. He presents again 10 days from initial presentation with bloody diarrhoea and collapse. His renal function tests are severely deranged, his clotting screen is normal but blood film examination shows severe thrombocytopenia with evidence of microangiopathic anaemia. Coombs' test and C-reactive protein are both negative. Which is the most probable underlying complication?",Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA),Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) due to VTEC E. coli,Septicaemia,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),C,"The initial presentation with diarrhoea with culture positive E. coli O157-H7 should lead one to consider HUS as the complication. Negative Coombs' test is against AIHA, whereas TTP would show several red cell fragments and neurological complications. DIC is excluded by the normal clotting screen and septicaemia is improbable seeing the normal inflammatory markers. HUS due to VTEC E. coli is the most probable diagnosis. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a triad of:  microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Coombs' test negative) thrombocytopenia, and acute renal failure.  Typical HUS is most commonly associated with Escherichia coli with somatic (O) antigen 157 and flagella (H) antigen 7, hence the designation O157:H7. It produces a toxin called Shiga toxin or verotoxin. General management includes appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, antihypertensive therapy and dialysis where required. "
hematological system,138,A 56-year-old man is being reviewed for an elective cholecystectomy in the pre-operative clinic. He has no comorbitities apart from two attacks of cholecystitis in the last 12 months. He has never received a blood transfusion in the past. The request for the blood bank should include which of the following?,Cross match for 3 units only,Group and save as well as cross match,"Group and save, direct Combs' test (DAT) and a cross match for 2 units","Group and save, direct Combs' test (DAT) and a cross match for 3 units",Group and save only,E,A 'group and save' is adequate for elective surgeries and is standard practice in most modern blood banks. This will involve blood grouping and its confirmation as well as an antibody screen. Other options include cross match and a direct Coombs' test (also known as the direct antiglobulin test or DAT) which are often done only if the antibody screen test is positive. These are not routinely done for elective surgery unless the patient has had a recent blood transfusion or a history of previous known red cell antibodies.
hematological system,139,A 17-year-old girl who had completed treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia six months previously presents with a short history of marked right hip pain and associated limp. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Avascular necrosis of the femoral head,Gout,Osteoarthritis,Pseudogout,Septic arthritis,A,"Avascular necrosis of the femoral head can occur as a consequence of her treatment or the disorder itself. At age 17, osteoarthritis is particularly unlikely. Gout too is unlikely (considering she completed treatment six months ago) unless she had relapsed (high white cell count) or had some other risk factors. She would be considered to be no more likely to get septic arthritis or pseudogout than anyone who had not previously had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, if in remission."
hematological system,140,A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia develops hypersplenism and pancytopenia. How should this be managed?,Bone marrow transplantation,Chemotherapy,Corticosteroids,Radiotherapy,Splenectomy,E,"In CLL where there is evidence of pancytopenia and hypersplenism, a splenectomy is required. Splenectomy is also used if complications such as autoimmune haemolytic anaemia or thrombocytopenia do not respond to steroids."
hematological system,141,"Concerning immune cell antigen receptors, which of the following statements is false?",Affinity maturation of the B cell receptor is an important process initiated during the primary immune response,IgD are surface receptors of B lymphocytes,In normal individuals T lymphocytes with T cell receptors (TCR) that recognise autoantigens are all deleted to prevent autoimmunity,TCRs with different antigen specificities can be co-expressed on a single T lymphocytes,The antigen specificity of the T cell receptor is generated during development,C,"T and B lymphocytes express receptors on their surface that recognise antigen in a specific manner. Each individual lymphocyte expresses a single type of receptor with unique specificity (except dual specificity T cells - see below). The receptor on the B lymphocyte is membrane bound immunoglobulin (IgM and IgD isotype) and recognises particulate antigen, whilst the TCR is a heterodimer that recognises peptide fragments presented by MHC molecules. The antigen specificity of T and B cells is generated during development by recombination of gene segments encoding the variable domains (antigen recognition domains) of immune receptors. These gene recombinations are random and maturing lymphocytes that express autoreactive receptors which are then deleted or rendered anergic. These processes take place in the thymus (T lymphocytes) and in the bone marrow (B lymphocytes). However, not all autoreactive lymphocytes are deleted during development. In the case of T lymphocytes, not all proteins are expressed in the thymus, and those that are present only in the periphery or at certain stages of development will encounter mature T cells that can respond to them. Thus, autoreactive T cells exist in the periphery and other mechanisms are responsible for the protection of the body against autoimmunity. Affinity maturation refers to the process of progressive development of immunoglobulin with higher affinity to the antigen. This occurs in the germinal centres of lymphoid organs during the evolution of the humoral response and is accomplished by hypermutation of the variable region genes. T cells with dual specificities have been reported although their function is unknown."
hematological system,142,Which of the following observations best describes the relationship between malaria and HbS?,HbS protects against all complications of falciparum malaria,"Malaria causes damage to red cell DNA, which is why sickle cell disease is more common in malarial regions","Only HbSS protects against malaria, HbAS is not protective",Patients with sickle cell disease do not get malaria,Sickle cell disease is most common in regions where P.falciparum malaria is endemic and in ethnic groups that have migrated from these areas,E,"The sickle cell gene is most prevalent in areas where malaria is also prevalent. This genetic abnormality is not caused by malaria, but the selective advantage of the carrier state in malarial regions has allowed it to persist in the gene pool (positive selective evolutionary pressure). Patients with sickle cell trait have just as much risk of contracting P. falciparum malaria compared with patients with HbAS or HbAA. However, the reduced red cell life cycle in HbAS reduces parasitaemia, which reduces the risk of severe disease and neurological complications (for example, seizures and coma). Patients with HbSS are at higher risk of severe malaria with complications and have a higher mortality rate."
hematological system,143,What is not true regarding Aldesleukin therapy?,Given as slow IV infusion,Interleukin 6 analogue,Can lead to hypotension,Interleukin 2 analogue,Utilised in renal cell carcinoma,B,Aldesleukin is an analogue of interleukin 2 utilised in the management of metastatic renal cell carcinoma and melanoma. It can be given as a slow IV infusion or subcutaneously and can lead to the capillary leak syndrome and thus hypotension.
hematological system,144,"A 56-year-old female presents at the general practitioner with weakness. A full blood count (FBC) reveals a haemoglobin concentration of 105 g/L (115-165) and a mean cell volume (MCV) of 104 fL (80-96), but no other abnormality. Which of the following may account for this?",Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),Scurvy,Thyrotoxicosis,Ulcerative colitis,Zollinger-Ellison syndrome,B,"This is a tricky question. However, if you bear in mind this patient's symptoms and her FBC you should come to the correct conclusion. She has weakness and in association with a mild anaemia and her increased MCV a vitamin C deficiency is most probable. Anaemia of this level should not cause weakness in itself. Scurvy should not be thought of as a disease of the past, as cases continue to be diagnosed in children and adults. Clinical manifestations vary, and can be seen within 8-12 weeks of irregular or inadequate dietary intake. The early stages are characterised by malaise, fatigue and lethargy. Dehydroascorbic acid, the oxidative product of ascorbic acid metabolism, passively penetrates cellular membranes and is the preferred form for erythrocytes and leukocytes. Ascorbic acid is a reversible biologic reductant, and provides reducing equivalents for a number of biochemical reactions involving iron and copper. Because of this property, it functions as a cofactor, enzyme complement, co-substrate, or a strong antioxidant in a variety of reactions and metabolic processes. Ascorbic acid provides electrons needed to reduce molecular oxygen. These anti-oxidant capabilities also stabilize a number of other compounds, including vitamin E and folic acid. It is a cofactor for reduction of folate to dihydro-and-tetrahydrofolate. Therefore macrocytic anaemia in scurvy may occur due to two reasons: oxidative hemolysis and folate metabolism defects. Continued deficiency leads to:  Anaemia Myalgia Bone pain Bruising Petechial and perifollicular haemorrhages Corkscrew hairs Gum disease Poor wound healing, and Mood changes.  Late stages can lead to:  Generalised oedema Severe jaundice Haemolysis Haemorrhage Neuropathy Convulsions, and Death.  Treatment for scurvy is vitamin C supplementation, and recovery is usually complete within three months. HRT can affect folate storage and absorption, but not usually to an extent to cause these biochemical changes. Ulcerative colitisis is more likely to be associated with iron (Fe) deficiency anaemia as is Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and ulcerative colitis are both associated with iron-deficiency anaemia, and therefore a microcytosis. Hypothyroidism, not thyrotoxicosis, is associated with macrocytosis. "
hematological system,145,There is evidence of an increased incidence of peptic ulceration in which of the following?,Blood group B,Cigarette smoking,Diabetes mellitus,Hypoparathyroidism,Pernicious anaemia,B,"Peptic ulceration occurs with increasing frequency in association with:  Drugs, such as steroids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Hyperparathyroidism Certain blood groups, such as O and A Family history Cigarette smoking H. pylori Chronic renal failure Renal transplantation Systemic mastocytosis, and HLA-B5."
hematological system,146,What drug therapy should be utilised in a patient with essential thrombocythaemia?,IV Immunoglobulin,Aspirin and hydroxyurea,Dalterparin,Clopidogrel,Aspirin,B,"Essential thrombocythaemia is where there is an increased production of platelets by megakaryocytes. However these platelets are dysfunctional and thus as well as presenting with thromboses, there is also features of bruising and bleeding. It is caused by a JAK2 mutation. There is usually evidence of a large spleen. The risk of thromboses is reduced with aspirin however to reduce the platelet count hydroxyurea, interferon alpha or anagrelide have been shown to be effective."
hematological system,147,"A 35-year-old lady with a history of two previous lower limb deep vein thromboses presents with a further DVT. She has a thrombophilia screen performed, which shows the presence of lupus anticoagulant. What is the best course of action?",Aspirin,Aspirin and warfarin,Long-term low molecular weight heparin,Warfarin for six months,Warfarin lifelong,E,"This patient has recurrent DVTs and has been shown to have the presence of the lupus anticoagulant. In the circumstances, evidence would suggest that lifelong anticoagulation with warfarin is required maintaining an international normalised ratio (INR) above 2.5. It is important to also test the solid phase antibodies anti-cardiolipin and anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-1 and to do all antibody testing while off warfarin as this can cause false positives.  In order for a diagnosis to be made antibodies need to be positive on 2 seperate ocassions, 3 months apart.  The use of direct oral anticoagulants can be used in specific cases though this should be discussed with a haematologists."
hematological system,148,A couple who are expecting their first child present to you for advice. Both parents are known to be carriers of sickle cell trait HbS and want to know if their child will inherit the disease. Which of the following do you advise?,There is no chance their child will inherit the disease,There is a 25% chance their child will inherit the disease,There is a 50% chance their child will inherit the disease,There is a 75% chance their child will inherit the disease,There is a 100% chance their child will inherit the disease,B,"This question is slightly ambiguous in the way it is worded but is, unfortunately, typical of those found in the MRCP exam. If both parents carry the sickle cell gene there is a 25% chance that their child will inherit sickle cell disease since the gene is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. There is a 25% chance the baby will not inherit any affected genes and a 50% chance they will have sickle cell trait.  Although there is no primary prevention for sickle cell disease genetic counselling can help advise heterozygous parents. Prenatal diagnosis is available by chorionic villus sampling at 8-10 weeks gestation or by amniocentesis at 14-16 weeks gestation. Use of the Family origin questionairre in those who do not know if they have sickle trait or not can be useful in aiding screening."
hematological system,149,"A patient presents with night sweats, fever and weight loss. She has also noticed a lump in her neck. On examination there is evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy. Which investigation will give the definitive diagnosis?",Peripheral blood film,Bone marrow biopsy,CT thorax,Chest X ray,Lymph node biopsy,E,This patient is likely to have Hodgkins disease. For the definitive diagnosis a lymph node biopsy is required and Reed Sternberg is pathognomonic. CT and bone marrow biopsy are required for staging purposes.
hematological system,150,Which of the following times would be appropriate for transfusing a blood product in a stable patient?,A packed cell transfusion should be given over 20 minutes,A packed cell transfusion should be given over 120 minutes,A platelet transfusion should be given over 60 minutes,A platelet transfusion should be given over 90 minutes,A platelet transfusion should be given over 120 minutes,B,In a stable patient red cell packs may be transfused over 2 - 3 hours (120-180 minutes). A red cell transfusion must be completed within 4 hours (240 minutes) from the time it was taken from the fridge. To allow for inevitable delays beginning the transfusion around 2 hours seems the optimal time. A platelet transfusion should not take more than 30 minutes. Rapid infusion of red cells or fresh frozen plasma may be required in acutely bleeding patient but not in this patient who is stable.
hematological system,151,A 48-year-old female with rheumatoid arthritis has the following full blood count results:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (120-165)   Platelets 470 ×10^9/L (150-450)   White Cell Count 9.0 ×10^9/L (4-10)   MCV 102 fL (83-95)    Which drug is she likely to be taking?,Ciclosporin,Hydroxychloroquine,Leflunomide,Methotrexate,Myocrisin,D,"Leflunomide is associated rarely with anaemia, thrombocytopaenia and eosinophilia. Ciclosporin may be associated with a mild anaemia. Methotrexate may be associated with haematopoietic suppression, leading to profound, and sometimes sudden leucopenia and thombocytopaenia. Myocrisin may also rarely lead to blood disorders, pancytopaenia and leucopenia. The elevated platelet count here probably relates to the rheumatoid arthritis itself as a late component of the acute phase response. Macrocytosis is seen as a consequence of long term methotrexate therapy. Co-existent B12 or folate deficiency or thyroid disease should be excluded."
hematological system,152,"A 5-year-old child presents with fever. He looks pale. His parents say he always feels tired. On exam: orchidomegaly& splenomegaly. Labs: WBC=1.7, Hgb=7.1, Plt=44.

hematological system,153,"A 55-year-old lady presents to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of lethargy, bruising, breathlessness at rest. Over the past 24 hours, she also developed a fever of 39°C. Physical examination shows pallor and ecchymosis over her back, together with 3 cm hepatomegaly. Blood investigations show an elevated white cell count at 101 × 10^9/L, haemoglobin of 54 g/L, platelet count of 10 × 10^9/L and a C-reactive protein of 210 mg/dL. Blood film examination shows a prominent leukocytosis with big cells with a high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio with rare Auer rods. What is the most probable underlying pathology?",Acute myeloid leukaemia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Follicular lymphoma,Myelofibrosis,Myelodysplasia,A,"The acute onset of symptoms, all related to abrupt onset of anaemia, thrombocytopenia and immunocompromise from neutropenia and presence of non-functional blast cells point to an acute malignancy. Blasts are not present in chronic myeloid leukaemia, unless in accelerated or blast phase and basophilia is usually present. Myelofibrosis would show prominent red cell morphology defects and splenomegaly. Follicular lymphoma would consist of small to medium circulating cells and no Auer rods. Although myelodysplasia is a diagnostic possibility, the presence of blast cells signifies transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia. The presence of bone marrow failure, with circulating myeloid blasts, all developing over a short period of time with no antecedent symptoms points towards acute myeloid leukaemia. Treatment involves resuscitation, antimicrobial cover of sepsis and institution of appropriate cytotoxic agents if indicated after characterization of AML using flow cytometry, depending on the performance status of the patient and after discussion of prognosis with the patient.

hematological system,154,What is the mechanism of action of low molecular weight heparin?,Activation of plasminogen,Chelation of calcium,Inhibition of activated factor X,Inhibition of antithrombin,Inhibition of vitamin K-dependent carboxylase,C,The shorter chain low molecular weight (LMW) fractions of heparin inhibit activated factor X but have less effect on thrombin (and on coagulation in general) than the high molecular weight (HMW) species.
hematological system,155,A 25-year-old gentleman with Burkitt's lymphoma is admitted and commenced on induction chemotherapy. Within 48 hours it is noticed that his urine output is dropping to 20 ml/hr. Further investigation shows:    Potassium 6.5 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Calcium 1.5 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Phosphate 4 mmol/L (0.8-1.4)   Creatinine 250 µmol/L (60-110)    Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this complication?,Allopurinol and intravenous hydration,Intravenous hydration with 3 L/m^2 and rasburicase,Intravenous hydration with 3 litres per day,Rasburicase only,Urinary alkalinisation,B,"This question concerns the management of acute tumour lysis syndrome (ATLS). Acute tumour lysis syndrome is a common complication of haematological tumours which have a high proliferation index, for example, Burkitt's lymphoma, hyperleukocytic acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Management revolves around institution of aggressive hydration, aiming for 3 L/m^2 control of electrolyte disturbances (typically, hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hyperkalaemia and uraemia) and clearance of the increased metabolic load with rasburicase, a specific recombinant enzyme. The incorrect answer options omit important aspects of the holistic management of acute tumour lysis syndrome."
hematological system,156,You are asked to review the lab results for a 71-year-old woman whose sample was sent in by the GP service. Clinical details report andquot;swollen left legandquot;. Results are unremarkable apart from a potassium of 5.9 mmol/L (3.5-5.5) and a reduced activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 16 seconds (25-40). Which of the following is the most likely cause of the APTT result?,Elevated factor IX,Hyperfibrinogenemia,In-vitro clotting cascade activation,Protein C deficiency,Protein S deficiency,C,"The clues here include the fact that potassium is elevated and APTT is reduced, raising the possibility that this patient has proved difficult to bleed. Difficult phlebotomy, coupled with the fact that transport from a GP surgery can take a significant length of time, promotes in-vitro activation of the clotting cascade and drives a reduction in the APTT. The sample should, however, be repeated, because rarely a procoagulant state can exist leading to an actual rather than artefactual reduction in APTT. Protein C and S deficiency do not promote a reduction in the APTT, but may, of course, be associated with hypercoagulability. Elevated factors XI, VIII, IX, II, and fibrinogen are recognised to lead to increased risk for venous thromboembolism and also lead to a reduction in APTT. It is thought that increased factor VIII activity is the commonest cause of reduced APTT, which also results in hypercoagulability."
hematological system,157,"A 30-year-old man presents with episodic jaundice and anaemia and has been diagnosed with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. On further testing, his wife has normal plasma G6PD activity. Which one of the following statements is correct?","50% of their children will be affected, irrespective of gender ",All of their children will be affected,All of their daughters will be affected,All of their sons will be affected,None of their children will be affected ,E,"G6PD is X-linked, therefore females are carriers, and are not usually affected unless there is inactivation of their X chromosome. Males are affected. Males will pass on the 'bad' X chromosome to their daughters so that they become carriers, and as said above they are not usually affected. Males pass on their Y chromosomes to any sons, therefore they will not be affected. In the question, the male is affected, but as the female has normal levels of the enzyme, we are assuming she is not a carrier (although strictly she could be a carrier and have normal levels). The male will pass on the X chromosome to any daughters, who will not be affected, as they will have a 'good' X from the mothers, and the father will pass on the Y chromosome to his sons, who will not be affected."
hematological system,158,Which of the following is not associated with EBV?,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Adult T cell lymphoma,Hodgkin's lymphoma,Burkitt's lymphoma,Hairy leucoplakia,B,EBV is associated with all of these except Adult T cell lymphoma which is associated with HTLV-1.
hematological system,159,"A patient is found to have a pancytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate and trephine show a hypocellular bone marrow with no evidence of increased reticulin and normal haemopoetic progenitors.

This is characteristic of aplastic anaemia. In those with severe aplastic anaemia who have become transfusion dependent then the options for treatment are allogeneic bone marrow transplant, antithymocyte globuline with or without ciclosporin. High dose cyclophosphamide with a bone marrow transplant is no longer recommended."
hematological system,160,"A 70-year-old lady presents to the Emergency Department at 2 am complaining of acute onset of severe bilateral headache, right upper and lower limb weakness, nausea, vomiting, and breathlessness. Computed tomography of the head shows no intracranial pathology. Blood investigations show a haemoglobin of 50 g/L, a platelet count of 2 × 10^9/L and no renal impairment. Clotting screen, including fibrinogen, is normal. Blood film examination shows extensive red cell fragments and confirms genuine thrombocytopenia. Which is the most probable underlying pathophysiology?",Acute ischaemic stroke,Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),Evans syndrome,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS),Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),E,"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a medical emergency, originally defined as a classic pentad of:  thrombocytopenia MAHA (microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia) neurological signs which tend to be fluctuating renal impairment, and fever.  Fever and renal impairment, although described as part of the classical pentad, are usually absent in the acute presentation. Evans syndrome, the combination of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia only, does not cause multisystem symptoms, and DIC is excluded by the normal clotting screen and fibrinogen. Although an ischaemic stroke is evident in this case, it is the platelet activation and resulting ischaemia from the TTP which is the underlying pathophysiological mechanism in play rather than a primary CVA. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura should be considered a medical emergency, and the initial diagnosis should be made on clinical history, examination and routine laboratory testing and blood film. To avoid early mortality, treatment with plasma exchange should be commenced on the day of the presentation as soon as possible. "
hematological system,161,Which of the following is true with regard to anti-neutrophilic cytoplasmic autoantibodies?,ANCA positive glomerulonephritis characteristically causes nephrotic syndrome ,They are increased in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),They are positive only in granulomatosis with polyangiitis associated with renal disease,They are present in inflammatory bowel disease,They cause neutropenia in SLE,D,Eighty-five percent of untreated subjects with granulomatosis with polyangiitis will have circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA) and those with limited disease are less likely to have positive serology. Perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (pANCA) is present in approximately 70% with ulcerative colitis and less than 20% of Crohn's patients. Neither p nor c-ANCA is typical of SLE. Initial renal damage causes proteinuria (focal proliferative glomerulonephritis) but renal function can deteriorate rapidly with development of acute focal necrotising glomerulonephritis.
hematological system,162,"A 52-year-old male presents with a history of lethargy and epistaxis over the last one month. Examination reveals numerous bruises over arms and legs, splenomegaly and retinal haemorrhages. A full blood count shows:    Haemoglobin 70 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 14 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 20 ×10^9/L (150-400)    His blood film reveals white cells predominantly myeloblasts and promyelocytes. Which one of the following investigations would be of most prognostic value?",Bone marrow aspiration,Bone marrow trephine biopsy,Cerebrospinal fluid examination,Cytogenetics and molecular studies,Immunophenotyping,D,"The history, full blood count results and the blood film are suggestive of acute myeloid leukaemia as there are numerous myeloblasts on film. Immunophenotyping helps to further characterise the cancer cells. Of the answers given the cytogenetic karyotype is of most prognostic value. The cytogenetic karyotype and molecular studies divides people into three categories:  good risk standard risk, and poor risk."
hematological system,163,An 18-year-old male presented with excessive bleeding following a tooth extraction. His investigations showed:    Platelet count 260 × 10^9/L (150-400)   Prothrombin time 13 s (11.5-15.5)   Activated partial thromboplastin time 86 s (30-40)   Factor VIII 110 IU/dL (50-150)    Deficiency of which of the following clotting factors is the most likely explanation for this patient?,II,V,VII,IX,X,D,"An elevated APTT could be due to:  treatment with heparin haemophilia von Willebrand's disease, or antiphospholipid syndrome.  A normal factor VIII would suggest haemophilia B where there is a lack of factor IX. A prolonged APTT can be seen in von Willebrand's disease, but factor VIII activity would be low. The presentation is not consistent with antiphospholipid syndrome and would also, typically, be associated with thrombocytopenia."
hematological system,164,Which of the following statements regarding disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is most correct?,DIC is associated with a rising platelet count,DIC is associated with an elevated D-dimer,DIC is associated with rising fibrinogen levels,Normal clotting parameters effectively exclude a diagnosis of DIC,Removal of the underlying cause of the DIC will lead to resolution of the manifestations of DIC,B,"DIC is caused by the enhanced and abnormally sustained generation of thrombin and is associated with elevated products of fibrin breakdown, one of these being D-dimer. Treatment of the underlying cause, for example, sepsis, does not always lead to resolution of the condition. DIC is associated with a falling platelet count and decreased fibrinogen, but the clotting factors may be normal, especially when one considers that the acute phase response may shorten the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and increase fibrinogen. Treatment of DIC should be to remove or treat the underlying cause, supportive care and address the underlying coagulopathy should bleeding ensue."
hematological system,165,A 35 year old female presents with her second DVT. She has also had four miscarriages and has livedo reticularis. She has no other past medical history and is not on any regular medications. Which of the following will be useful in confirming the suspected diagnosis?,Factor V leiden mutation,Coagulation profile,Anticardiolipin antibodies,Protein S level,Protein C level,C,"Given the history of recurrent DVTs, miscarriages and livedo reticularis then the most likely diagnosis is primary antiphospholipid syndrome.  It can be secondary when associated with SLE. In antiphospholipid syndrome lupus anticoagulant or anticardiolipin antibodies are detected and aid in confirming the diagnosis along with the clinical features."
hematological system,166,"A patient on your ward is prescribed warfarin as she has recently been diagnosed with atrial fibrillation. Her desired INR is 2.5. On the morning ward round, you take the patient's INR which comes back as 5.2 from the laboratory. There are no signs of bleeding. Which would be your next course of action?",Decrease the dose of warfarin,"Do nothing, as there are no signs of bleeding",Increase the dose of warfarin,Omit the warfarin,Start a heparin infusion,D,"The main adverse effect of all oral anticoagulants is haemorrhage. Checking the INR and omitting doses when appropriate is essential; if the anticoagulant is stopped but not reversed, the INR should be measured two to three days later to ensure that it is falling. The following recommendations are based on the result of the INR and whether there is major or minor bleeding; the recommendations apply to patients taking warfarin:  Major bleeding - omit warfarin; give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) 5-10 mg by slow intravenous injection; give dried prothrombin complex (factors II, VII, IX, and X) 30-50 units/kg (if dried prothrombin complex unavailable, fresh frozen plasma 15 mL/kg can be given but is less effective). INR 8.0, no bleeding or minor bleeding - omit warfarin and give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) 2.5-5 mg by mouth using the intravenous preparation orally [unlicenced use], or 0.5-1 mg by slow intravenous injection (if complete reversal required 5-10 mg by slow intravenous injection); repeat dose of phytomenadione if INR still too high after 24 hours; restart warfarin when INR less than 5.0. INR 5.0-8.0, no bleeding - omit warfarin; minor bleeding - omit warfarin and give phytomenadione (vitamin K1) 1-2.5 mg by mouth using the intravenous preparation orally [unlicenced use]; restart warfarin when INR less than 5.0. Unexpected bleeding at therapeutic levels - always investigate possibility of underlying cause, for example, unsuspected renal or gastrointestinal tract pathology."

This was borne out in the SHOT study which analysed transfusion errors and 'near misses' in a UK wide audit. Other errors such as cross match error, incorrect storage and transfusion reaction due to an antibody not detected do occur but are rare. "
hematological system,168,Which of the following statements is most true regarding polycythaemia rubra vera (PRV)?,PRV is often associated with hypertension and smoking,"PRV is usually associated with a high haemoglobin, but with neutropenia and thrombocytopenia",PRV may be characterised by a raised packed cell volume (PCV) and decreased plasma volume,"The diagnosis of PRV can be made based on a high red cell mass, reduced EPO and characteristic bone marrow biopsy findings",Venesection treatment will improve long term survival rates,D,"The diagnosis of PRV is based on the revised WHO criteria. Diagnosis requires two major criteria and one minor criterion, or the first major criterion and two minor criteria. Major criteria:  Haemoglobin of more than 185 g/L in men, 165 g/L in women, or elevated red cell mass greater than 25% above mean normal predicted Presence of JAK 2 mutations, commonly 617V F  Minor criteria:  Bone marrow biopsy showing hypercellularity with prominent erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic proliferation Serum EPO below normal range Endogenous erythroid colony formation in vitro.  Oxygen saturations, splenic size, platelet count and white cell count no longer feature in the diagnostic criteria. A decreased plasma volume causing a raised PCV is known as apparent or spurious polycythaemia. This may be associated with hypertension or smoking. PRV is usually associated with a raised haemoglobin and often with a high platelet count and white cell count. Venesection will lessen the rates of thrombotic complications but there is no evidence that venesection improves long-term survival rates. "

hematological system,170,"A 45-year-old, obese, Afro-Caribbean woman presented with unexplained confusion, shortness of breath, cold and pain in her fingers and toes. She is usually fit and well and had only a transient gastrointestinal upset few weeks ago, after which she has felt increasingly tired with worsening confusion. She had no regular medications, did not smoke or use excessive amounts of alcohol. She has returned from a two-day trip to Malaysia yesterday. On examination, she was mildly confused, looked generally pale with cold peripheries and very pale nail folds. She was apyrexial, mildly tachycardic and tachypnoeic with normal heart sounds and bibasal crepitations on chest auscultation. She had no focal neurological deficit or cranial nerve palsy but during examination, she developed a one-minute seizure involving the right side of her body. Her chest x ray showed bilateral peripheral patchy parenchymal opacities and routine bloods showed:    Sodium 137 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 5.8 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Creatinine 110 µmol/L (60-110)   Urea 7.1 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Albumin 36 g/L (37-49)   Total bilirubin 28 µmol/L (1-22)   Alk.phosphatase 77 IU/L (30-110)   ALT 14 IU/L (5-40)   LDH 450 IU/L (672)   CRP 8 mg/L (less than5)   Hb 79 g/L (130-180)   Haematocrit 25%   WBC 11.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 20 ×10^9/L (150-400)   MCV 93 fL (80-96)   Prothrombin time 14.2 seconds (11.5-15.5)   INR 1.1 less than1.4   APTT 21.2 seconds (30-40)    Peripheral smear shows fragmented schistocytes and an elevated reticulocyte count. Which is the most likely cause of this patient's neurological presentation?",Cerebral malaria,Cerebral venous sinuses thrombosis,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Intracranial haemorrhage due to essential thrombocytopenia,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),E,"TTP is a clinical diagnosis and potential diagnosis in any patient with anaemia and thrombocytopenia; 95% of cases are fatal if left untreated. Symptoms are usually non-specific. Renal and neurological dysfunctions are the main complications. Examination of the peripheral smear is critical and shows evidence of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with fragmented RBCs (schistocytes) and thrombocytopenia. An urgent haematological consultation is recommended for suspected cases. Plasma exchange therapy is the mainstay of treatment. A pentad of clinical features which characterise the disease are:  Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia.The peripheral smear shows microangiopathic haemolysis as evidenced by the presence of schistocytes Thrombocytopenia with purpura Acute renal insufficiency (usually less marked in TTP than in haemolytic uraemic syndrome) Neurological abnormalities (usually more marked in TTP than in haemolytic uraemic syndrome) Neurological manifestations are present in most patients, and range from confusion and severe headache, to focal neurological abnormalities, seizures and coma Fever.  Not all of the above may be present. Other features are:  Purpura, ecchymosis, and menorrhagia due to thrombocytopenia may also be seen in 20% of cases Peripheral digit ischaemic syndrome Nonocclusive mesenteric ischaemia Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).  Additional laboratory findings:  The reticulocyte count is generally elevated Lactate dehydrogenase and bilirubin are often elevated as markers of haemolysis Direct Coombs' test should be negative to rule out autoimmune haemolytic anaemia Assays have been developed to measure von Willebrand factor cleaving enzyme (ADAMTS-13) activity. ADAMTS-13 activity can be low, and inhibitors to its activity can often be demonstrated in patients with TTP.  Cerebral malaria is an important differential diagnosis in travellers to the endemic areas and who present with decreased Glasgow coma score (GCS) and history of fevers, but the incubation period is usually 7 to 14 days. In this case, the patient developed symptoms gradually, and prior to her travel. A history of fevers would strongly suggest the possibility of malaria although fever may also be present in TTP, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and all can give a similar laboratory picture. TTP in this clinical scenario would be the first on the differential list. Cerebral venous sinuses thrombosis clinically may present as headache, focal neurological deficit, seizures and decreased level of GCS but pathogenesis is usually associated with prothrombotic conditions (with thrombocytosis being more likely rather then thrombocytopenia). The pathogenesis of neurological disturbances in TTP is formation of microthrombi in microcirculation. Haemolytic uraemic syndrome is the main differential in thrombocytopenia and haemolytic anaemia but this presents with more marked renal failure and neurological complications occur less frequently. This is clearly not essential thrombocytopenia, which, as the definition says, affects only megakaryocytic lineage. In this clinical scenario, there is laboratory evidence of haemolytic anaemia. "
hematological system,171,"A 31-year-old woman comes to the clinic for review of chronic diarrhoea. She tells you she is opening her bowels some four to five times per day and has lost 5 kg in weight over the past six months. There is no blood and the diarrhoea has a strong smell and is difficult to flush away. On examination her BP is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 75 and regular, her BMI is 21. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 108 g/L (115-160)   MCV 75 fL (80-96)   White cell count 9.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   ESR 41 mm/hr (less than10)   Platelets 182 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.6 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 115 µmol/L (79-118)   Albumin 24 gL (35-50)    Which of the following investigations is likely to be most useful in confirming the diagnosis?",Anti-endomysial antibodies,Colonoscopy,CT abdomen,Faecal elastase,Faecal fat estimation,A,"The age of the patient and symptoms consistent with malabsorption, coupled with low albumin and iron deficiency anaemia fit best with a diagnosis of coeliac disease. As such anti-endomysial antibodies are the most appropriate of the investigations listed to confirm the diagnosis. The first line investigation is total immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgA tissue transglutaminase (tTG) though this is not an option here Colonoscopy is useful only if lower GI pathology is suspected, and CT abdomen is not very useful to confirm a diagnosis of coeliac. Faecal elastase is a test for pancreatic insufficiency, and whilst faecal fat estimation will be useful in confirming malabsorption, it will not differentiate between pancreatic pathology and small bowel disease.

hematological system,172,"A 21 year old female presents with increased frequency of nose bleeds. She has also noticed easy bruising and bleeding from her gums. Bloods reveal a slightly low haemoglobin, normal white cell count and platelets of 15. Blood film confirm thrombocytopenia with the platelets which are present being large in size. She is otherwise fit and well and is on no medications. There is nil of note on examination. What treatment should be initiated?",Corticosteroids,Splenectomy,Cyclophosphamide,IV Immunoglobulin,Azathioprine,A,This history and clinical findings is highly indicative of ITP. There is no other medical or drug history making it unlikely to be drug related. In aplastic anaemia and leukaemia you would expect to find other abnormal findings in the blood. In Von willebrands you would not expect there to be low platelets.  ITP is thought to be an autoimmune process where there is immunological destruction of platelets.  It can be acute (most often in childhood) where it often is post viral and self resolves or chronic which occur in adults. In 80% of chronic ITP there is platelet membrane (usually GP IIb/IIIa) autoantibodies found. Patients can be asymptomatic or present as in this case or with severe haemorrhage. Spontaneous haemorrhage does not usually occur until platelets are less than 20. Steroids are useful as a first line management. IVIg is also considered and may be utilised if steroids are contraindicated. If this fails then splenectomy should be considered. Other immunosuppressives such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine  can also be considered.
hematological system,173,"A patient post operatively  is found to have a prolonged APTT, high normal PT, prolonged TT and normal reptilase. What does this indicate?",Liver disease,Von Willebrands disease,Dysfibrinogenaemia,DIC,Contamination of sample with heparin,E,"A prolonged APTT with normal PT and normal reptilase is highly suggestive of heparin contamination of the sample. The patient is post op and could be on a heparin infusion. DIC, Liver disease and dyfibrinogenaema would all show a prolonged reptilase. Reptilase is not inhibited by antithrombin III and thus is not prolonged with heparin. It is therefore very useful in identifying If samples have been contaminated with heparin."
hematological system,174,A pregnant patient is found to have a macrocytic anaemia in her third trimester. What is the most likely cause?,Hypothyroid,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Iron deficiency,Folate deficiency,Dilutional,D,The most likely cause of a macrocytic anaemia during pregnancy is folate deficiency. This is because during pregnancy the folate requirements are increased. This is why folate supplementation is given before and during pregnancy.

He suddenly develops visual disturbance, renal failure and headache. How should this patient be managed?",Urgent plasmapheresis,Chlorambucil,Urgent CT head,Prednisolone,Rituximab,A,"This patient most likely has an underlying diagnosis of Waldenstroms macroglobulinaemia which is a rare B cell lymphoproliferative disorder with the production of an IgM paraprotein and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. Hyperviscosity can occur and presents similarly to above such as hypertension, visual disturbance, seizures, neurological signs and reduced consciousness, thrombosis and renal failure. Plasmapheresis is required when this occurs. Chemotherapy and rituximab can be utilised in the treatment of Waldenstroms macroglobulinaemia."

Which drug is the most likely cause of these abnormalities?,Aciclovir ,Amiloride ,Amoxicillin ,Paracetamol ,Trimethoprim ,E,"There is a pancytopenia and marrow aspirate shows reduction in production of all cellular elements. Trimethoprim is the drug most likely of these five to cause depression of haematopoiesis, as this picture would be particularly unusual with paracetamol, amiloride, aciclovir and amoxicillin."
hematological system,177,Which of the following is the blood product with the highest risk of transmission of a bacterial infection related to transfusion?,Cryoprecipitate,Factor VIII concentrates,Fresh frozen plasma,Packed red cells,Platelets,E,"Since platelets are stored at room temperature (22°C), the risk of bacterial contamination is highest in this blood product. In contrast packed red cells are stored at an average of 4°C while fresh frozen plasma as well as cryoprecipitate are stored at −20°C. Factor VIII concentrates are heat inactivated freeze dried products with a minimal risk of bacterial contamination."

Which of the following is imatinib?,Inhibits guanylate cyclase,Inhibits HER,Inhibits MAP kinase,Inhibits p53,Inhibits tyrosine kinase,E,"Imatinib is an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase and is used in the treatment of conditions such as chronic myelocytic leukaemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST). It inhibits TK on abl proto-oncogene, c-kit and the PDGF-R. In CML, the Philadelphia chromosome leads to a fusion protein of abl with bcr (breakpoint cluster region), termed bcr-abl. As this is now a continuously active tyrosine kinase, imatinib is used to decrease bcr-abl activity."
hematological system,179,A 75-year-old man has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. He has had treatment with several courses of chemotherapy and has now been admitted to hospital with pneumonia. His medical history revealed that he had suffered several previous upper respiratory tract infections over the previous six months. Which of the following components of his immune system is likely to be deficient?,Complement,Immunoglobulin G,Macrophages,Mast cells,T lymphocytes,B,"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is commonly complicated by panhypogammaglobulinaemia. Although intravenous immunoglobulin prevents recurrent infections it does not prolong survival. Complement is unlikley to be changed nor are mast cells.  In CLL multiple changes to the tumour microenvironment and the cells within have been documented extensively. The changes in these cells include T cells, macrophages, nautrial killer cell and myeloid dervied suprresor cells to mention a few. Though these changes are seen in CLL they are not always deficeicnt in these cell populations and more commonly they vary in the cell phenotype. For that reason the answer here is immunoglobulin G which is found to be deficeicnt in up to 25% of CLL patients."

hematological system,184,A patient with chronic venous insufficiency is about to travel to Australia. He has never had a DVT but is concerned about the risk of developing one. He is given compression stockings. He is given advice about exercises to perform during the flight and other general advice. What additional steps should be taken?,Warfarin,Start 75mg aspirin,Low molecular weight heparin,No further action,Start 150mg aspirin,D,If a patient has had a previous VTE in the last year or a travel related VTE in the last 5 years they should be referred to a haematologist as a single dose of LMWH 2 to 3 hours before the depature may be considered. There is no evidence that increasing the dose of aspirin or adding aspirin is preventative. In this patient there is no history of a DVT and thus no additional steps should be taken. Compression stockings should be utilised however in those with moderate risk.

hematological system,188,What is the mechanism of action of hydroxycarbamide in the setting of its use in sickle cell disease?,Causing vasodilation,Decreasing the tendency of HbS to polymerise,Increasing the life span of sickle shaped redblood cells,Reducing the permeability of red blood cellmembranes,Stimulation of the production of fetal haemoglobin,E,Stimulation of the production of fetal haemoglobin is its use in sickle cell anaemia; its usual mode of action is on its reduction of production of deoxyribonucleotides via inhibition of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. Hydroxycarbamide works by stimulating the production of fetal haemoglobin which protects against sickling. In HbS the negative charge is lost and this removes the inhibition to polymerise. HbS polymers interact with the red blood cell membrane creating temporary pores thus increasing permeability. HbS has a life span of 30 days compared to the normal 120 days. Vasodilation is caused by nitric oxide (endothelial derived relaxing factor).

",B12 and folate deficiency,Brain metastases,Paraneoplastic syndrome,Peripheral neuropathy related to chemotherapy,Spinal cord compression,D,"ABVD is the first line chemotherapy regime in Hodgkin's lymphoma. It is a combination of Adriamcyin, Bleomycin, Vincristine, and Dacarbazine. Vincristine prevents the protein tubular from binding to chromosomes and separating them during the M phase of the cell cycle. One of the most common side effects of vincristine is peripheral neuropathy, which typically improves on cessation of the drug but some patients will be left with permanent symptoms.  B12 and folate deficiency is a possibility with this neuropathic distribution but is less likely given the normal MCV. Spinal cord compression would not usually cause symptoms in this distribution. It classically presents with pain, followed by leg weakness and bowel and/or bladder dysfunction in the later stages.  Paraneoplastic peripheral neuropathy is possible in Hodgkin's lymphoma, but is less common than vincristine toxicity. Hodgkin's lymphoma can result in brain involvement but this would not classically present with symptoms in this distribution."
hematological system,190,"A 34-year-old man with normal baseline cardiac and respiratory function starts on the ABVD (Adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine) chemotherapy regimen for his stage IIB Hodgkin's lymphoma. He tolerated the first three cycles of the chemotherapy well. After completion of the fourth cycle, he presents with exertional dyspnoea, a dry cough, and basal fine crackles. He is afebrile, a chest x ray and ECG are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnostic possibility?",Adriamycin related cardiomyopathy,Bleomycin related pulmonary fibrosis,Hyperemesis and reflex cough related to dacarbazine,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia,Vinblastine related neurotoxicity,B,"Bleomycin related pulmonary fibrosis is a major toxicity of the widely used ABVD regimen for treatment of lymphoma. A high-resolution CT scan and pulmonary function tests are required to diagnose this condition. Although Adriamycin can cause cardiotoxicity this is unusual at the doses used in this regimen and one would expect abnormalities on the ECG. He is afebrile so pneumocytis is less likely, although it needs to be considered in the differential. There is no history of hyperemesis given and a vinblastine neuropathy is unlikely to present as acute shortness of breath."
hematological system,191,"In idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, there are antibodies directed at which of the following?",ADP receptor,Antithrombin III,ATP receptor,Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa complex,Platelet-activating factor,D,"In many cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, the cause is not actually idiopathic but autoimmune, with antibodies against platelets being detected in approximately 80% of patients. Most often these antibodies are against platelet membrane glycoproteins IIb-IIIa or Ib-IX, and are of the IgG type. The coating of platelets with IgG renders them susceptible to opsonisation and phagocytosis by splenic macrophages. "
hematological system,192,A 73-year-old woman has lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. She feels well but has had recurrent chest infections recently. Choose the single most likely blood film findings?,Atypical lymphocytes,Excess of mature lymphocytes,Plasma cells,Multiple immature granulocytes with blast cells,Numerous blast cells,B,Diagnosis is CLL. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes which looks mature but with defective function. Age of patient is usually above 50 yrs. There is lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. Repeated chest infection points towards abnormal function of lymphocytes against infection. This is a blood and bone marrow disease that usually gets worse slowly. Therefore survival rates for chronic lymphocytic leukemia are good compared to many other cancers
hematological system,193,A patient with acute myeloid leukaemia presents with headaches. She has never suffered from headaches before. She has now noticed a left sided facial droop and now is drowsy. Out of the following what is a likely cause?,Hyperleukocytosis,Meningeal infiltration,Radiotherapy,Migraine,Anaemia,A,"Hyperleukocytosis can lead to headaches and neurological features as described here. Meningeal infiltration is more common in children and tends to present with features of raised ICP such as headache, vomiting, and meningeal symptoms."
hematological system,194,"A 14 year old male has been unwell with a flu like illness with fever, arthralgia and general malaise. He has also noticed that he easily bruises and has noticed some blood in his urine. On examination he is pyrexial, jaundiced and there is evidence of purpura. Bloods reveal anaemia, thrombocytopenia. raised reticulocyte count, elevated LDH, increased bilirubin and renal failure. A blood film reveals schistocytes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Haemolytic anaemia,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Henoch Schonlein Purpura,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,B,"TTP is a form of thrombotic microangiopathy and is characterised by haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, fever, renal abnormalities and neurological abnormalities such as headaches or seizures. It has been associated with pregnancy, malignancy, oral contraceptives and E Coli. It is similar to HUS however this tends to follow E Coli infection and bloody diarrhoea and does not lead to fever or neurological features. Schistocytes are a characteristic feature. The blood results in this case confirm haemolysis."
hematological system,195,"A patient with septicaemia begins to bleed from her nose, ear and venflon sites. A coagulation screen reveals prolonged PT and APTT and a low fibrinogen and platelet count. Given the most likely diagnosis, which investigation will aid in confirming the diagnosis?",D dimers,Thrombin time,Bleeding time,Blood cultures,Nil required,A,Given the platelet count and coagulation screen results the most likely diagnosis is disseminated intravascular coagulation. There should also be evidence of formation of thrombin and plasmin and D dimers provides strong evidence for DIC. Thrombin time is useful but does not confirm the diagnosis.
hematological system,196,"A 10-year-old boy is noticed to be jaundiced on return from a holiday in Africa with his parents. He is on antimalarial prophylaxis. His complete blood count shows haemoglobin of 80 g/L, with Heinz bodies and blister cells on blood film examination. Which of the following relates to this disorder?",It is most commonly precipitated by peas,The antimalarial prophylaxis has no relation to the laboratory findings,This is a common autosomal dominant disorder,Transfusion is strictly merited in each case,Treatment involves strict avoidance of known precipitants,E,"This question relates to the management of G-6-PD deficiency. G-6-PD is the most common inherited enzyme defect in humans; an X-linked inheritance pattern. It is mostly commonly precipitated by several classes of drugs, including antimalarials and is also associated with ingestion of broad beans (favism). Treatment revolves around avoidance of all known precipitating factors, and blood product support should only be given in unstable, symptomatic patients."
hematological system,197,A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presents for check up. Over the last few months she has noticed lumps in her neck and axilla which have grown rapidly. She has lost weight and complains of being feverish. Which investigation will confirm the most likely diagnosis?,Coombs test,Lymph node biopsy,LDH level,Bone marrow biopsy,Blood cultures,B,"The history of rapidly growing lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss on a background of CLL suggests Richters transformation where CLL transforms in to a poorly differentiated high grade lymphoma. It is thought to occur in approximately 5 to 10% of patients. A lymph node biopsy is required to confirm this is the case."
hematological system,198,Which of the following genetic mutations is associated with the worst prognosis in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia?,inv 16,T(119),T(411),T(1221),T(922),C,The philadelphia chromosome is associated with a very poor prognosis in ALL. inv 16 is associated with AML not ALL.
hematological system,199,A 64 year old female has just be diagnosed with Temporal Arteritis. Her recent bloods show a raised WCC. She states she has been feeling well. Which of the following is the most likely cause?,CLL,UTI,Due to the Temporal Arteritis,Steroid use,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,D,Given the recent diagnosis this patient will have been commenced on steroids. Steroids lead to a leucocytosis and this is therefore the most likely cause. It is important to rule out infection but this patients states she is feeling well.
hematological system,200,"Following a splenectomy, which complication is the biggest risk?",Bleeding,Pulmonary fibrosis,Thrombosis,Infection,Lymphoma,D,"The complication which holds the greatest risk is infection with encapsulated bacteria which can lead to overwhelming postsplenectomy infection. H Influenzae, N. meningitis and Strep pneumoniae vaccinations are required annually due to this risk. They should also be given 2 weeks prior to the splenectomy. Patients then require long term prophylaxsis with penicillin. Thrombocytosis can occur in the first 10 days but there is no association with increased risk of thromboses."
hematological system,201,"A 60-year-old Chinese man has been started by his general practitioner on quinine for leg cramps. He presents a week later with five days of darkened urine and two days of increasing breathlessness, back pain, and fatigue. Investigations show a haemoglobin of 70 g/L (130-180) and raised reticulocyte count. Which of the following best explains this drug reaction?",Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Hereditary spherocytosis,Pyruvate kinase deficiency,Sickle cell disease,B,"G6PDH (X-linked recessive) is seen in people of African, Mediterranean, Iraqi, Jewish, South East Asian, and Chinese origin, and predisposes to a haemolytic anaemia reaction with drugs or infection. Implicated drugs include:  aspirin sulphonamides antimalarials, and quinine/quinidine.  The haemolytic anaemia is non-immune (direct antiglobulin test [DAT] negative). Pyruvate kinase deficiency is autosomal recessive and presents as a chronic haemolytic anaemia exacerbated by viral infections. Hereditary spherocytosis is characterised by variable chronic non-immune haemolysis, exacerbated by infections."
hematological system,202,A 61-year-old man presents with haematuria. He is on warfarin for chronic atrial fibrillation. His FBC shows a Hb of 112 g/L and his INR is 9 - the patient is haemodynamically stable. The consultant on take advises that this patient needs reversal of the warfarin. Which of the following would be the blood product/s of choice?,Cryoprecipitate,Prothrombin concentrate ('Octaplex'),Packed cells,Platelets,Recombinant factor VII,B,"Prothrombin concentrates are products of choice for warfarin reversal in the setting of active bleeding and a markedly raised INR. While packed cells are important to treat significant bleeding it would not be indicated at this stage. Cryoprecipitate, recombinant factor VII and platelets are not indicated for warfarin reversal."
hematological system,203,"A 54 year old gentleman presents with pruritus. He is also having intermittent headaches and dizziness. On examination the patient has a ruddy complexion and splenomegaly. He is hypertensive. Bloods reveal a raised haemoglobin, increased packed cell volume and mildly elevated platelets and white cells. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the most common complication?",Cardiac failure,Erythromelalgia,Thrombosis,Renal failure,Bleeding,C,"The most likely underlying diagnosis is polycythaemia rubra vera which is a myeloproliferative disorder where there is excessive production of not only red blood cells but, platelets and leucocytes as well. Due to the hyperviscosity the greatest risk is of development of thromboses. This can lead to DVT, Budd Chiari syndrome and stroke. Bleeding is another common complication most commonly from gums, GI haemorrhage or bruising."
hematological system,204,A patient with von Willebrands disease is requiring surgery. How should you manage this patient?,Fresh frozen plasma,Platelet transfusion,Steroids,DDAVP and tranexamic acid,Cryoprecipitate,D,Von Willebrands disease is a qualitative or quantitative defect in von Willebrands factor which is important in platelet adhesion and in binding to factor VIII and preventing its clearance. DDAVP can increase factor VIII levels and can be utilised before surgery. Factor VIII concentrate can also be utilised as there is high levels of vWF. FFP and cryoprecipitate do contain vWF but large volumes are required. Tranexamic acid is also useful in preventing bleeding.
hematological system,205,Which of the following are features of acute chest syndrome in sickle cell anaemia?,Chest pain,Evidence of new infiltration on CXR,Fever,Shortness of breath,All of the above,E,"Acute chest syndrome, a complication of sickle cell disease, is defined as a 'new infiltrate consistent with consolidation at least segmental in size, and one of chest pain, a temperature greater than 38.5°C, tachypnoeic, wheezing or cough'. It is a medical emergency with a high mortality if not treated with a red blood cell exchange. It is important to remember that not all of the above features will be present at the same time, CXR changes often lag behind. The key is to have a high index of suspicion and monitor vital signs particularly oxygen saturations regularly and anticipate development of possible acute chest syndrome. Early recognition and treatment is life-saving. Chest pain is often a feature of acute chest syndrome, either from the onset or presenting later during the course of disease. Shortness of breath is an important feature of acute chest syndrome and one of the main markers of deterioration indicating the need for possible exchange transfusion. All sickle patients should have their oxygen saturations measured regularly on air. Fever, usually a temperature of greater than 38.5°C, is another recognised feature of acute chest syndrome. All patients with temperatures more than 38°C should have cultures sent. Although new infiltrates are a characteristic feature of acute chest syndromes, it is important to remember that they can lag behind, and treatment should not be delayed in the absence of CXR changes if all other clinical signs suggest acute chest syndrome. Acute chest syndrome is a combination of signs and symptoms, not all of them need to be present for a diagnosis to be made.  "
hematological system,206,"In sickle cell anaemia, which of the following organisms is not commonly associated with infection in these patients?",Haemophilus influenzae,Chlamydia trachomatis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus,Neisseria meningitis,D,In sickle cell anaemia there is splenic infarction. This leads to increased susceptibility to infection by encapsulated organisms. All of these except staphylococcus aureus are encapsulated organisms.
hematological system,207,What is the purpose of irradiating blood products?,Inactivation of host lymphocytes,Reduce bacterial contamination,Depletion of number of donor lymphocytes,Inactivation of residual donor lymphocytes,Apoptose CMV virus,D,Transfusion of blood products in patients who are immunosuppressed may lead to transfusion associated graft versus host disease as the donor lymphocytes may attack the host cells. By irradiating blood this inactivates any residual donor lymphocytes and therefore prevents development of graft versus host disease.
hematological system,208,"In addition to tissue typing of HLA A,B and DR, what other HLA typing is useful for allogeneic bone marrow transplantation?",HLA DPB1,Nil else required,HLA DPA1,HLA C,HLA DQA1,D,HLA C matching may improve outcome.
hematological system,209,A 9 year old girl is brought to her GP. Her mother has noticed that she appears jaundice. She is feeling very tired. This has happened intermittently on several occasions. On examination she appears jaundice and there is evidence of splenomegaly. Bloods reveal an elevated unconjugated bilirubin and LDH. There is evidence of an elevated reticulocyte count. A blood film reveals reticulocytes and spherocytes. Which of the following is the most useful in differentiating hereditary spherocytosis from autoimmune haemolytic anaemia?,Osmotic fragility test,Bone marrow biopsy,Haptoglobin,Osmotic gradient ektacytometry,Direct Antiglobulin Test,E,"The history and clinical findings are inkeeping with hereditary spherocytosis. It can be inherited either autosomal dominantly or recessively. There may be mutations in genes for spectrin, ankyrin or other membrane proteins. It can range for mild to severe. Most often patients have a moderate illness with anaemia, intermittent jaundice and palpable splenomegaly. They can develop an aplastic crisis following infection with parvovirus. The blood film findings are also seen in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia however the direct antiglobulin test is useful for differentiating as it is negative in hereditary spherocytosis and positive in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The appearance of spherocytes may also be useful as unlike in AIHA the spherocytes are fairly uniform in size and density. The osmotic fragility test is thought to be the gold standard in the diagnosis in patient's where the direct antiglobulin test is negative and there is evidence of spherocytes especially if there is a family history. However it can miss the diagnosis if there is only a small number of spherocytes."
hematological system,210,"Patient with low hemoglobin, MCV 76, angular stomatitis, red tongue, and koilonychia. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Folate deficiency anemia,B12 deficiency anemia,Iron deficiency anemia,Vit E deficiency anemia,Hemolytic anemia,C,"Low MCV (range for MCV is 80-96 fL) , angular stomatitis, red tongue and koilonychia are characteristic of iron deficiency anemia"
hematological system,211,"In the considerstion of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which of the following statements is most correct?","In DIC asociated with sepsis secondary to retained products of conception, treatment of antibiotics will alleviate the process",Organ failure is a common finding in DIC,The intrinsic pathway is not involved in the pathophysiology of DIC,The presence of DIC does not increase mortality from the underlying disease,There are no randomised control trials to guide treatment in DIC,B,"DIC is caused by the enhanced and abnormally sustained generation of thrombin. Organ failure is a common finding, being as common as bleeding in DIC, and is likely to be due to fibrin deposition within the organ. The presence of DIC significantly increases mortality rates in affected patients, and treatment of the underlying cause of the DIC, for example, sepsis, does not always lead to resolution of the condition. Secondary bursts of thrombin formation seen in DIC are instigated by the intrinsic pathway. For a well-informed review see the article below. Further reading: Toh CH, Dennis M. Disseminated intravascular coagulation: old disease, new hope. BMJ 2003:327:974-7"
hematological system,212,A pregnant woman attends for her booking antenatal appointment. She lives and is being treated within a high prevalence trust. How will screening for sickle cell disease be undertaken?,Amniocentesis cannot distinguish whether the fetus has sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease,It will depend on the family origin of herself and her partner,She will automatically be offered chorionic villus sampling at 8-10 weeks gestation,"She will first be screened for sickle cell carrier status. If that test is positive, her partner will be screened, and only if both are positive will she be offered chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis",The screening only detects HbS. It does not detect any other haemoglobinopathies,D,"In low prevalence trusts, laboratory screening is only carried out if the baby is identified as being at risk of a haemoglobinopathy based on the family origin questionnaire, and a routine full blood count from the mother. In high prevalence trusts, all women undergo the initial laboratory screening to identify if the mother carries the sickle cell gene, regardless of family origin. However, the family origin questionnaire still needs to be completed to facilitate diagnosis of the type of haemoglobinopathy. The father is tested for carrier status only if the mother is found to be a carrier. If both are found to be carriers this is confirmed by genetic testing before offering chorionic villus sampling (CVS) (8-10 weeks) or amniocentesis (14-16 weeks). The use of a family origin questionaire is helpful in determining risk.  "
hematological system,213,"A 30-year-old lady presents to the Emergency Department with a 2-week history of bruising, accompanied by bleeding from her gums and nose. She has no prior medical history, was not admitted to hospital recently and takes no medication. Physical examination shows extensive purpura over her extremities, together with wet blisters on her tongue and gums. Blood investigations show a platelet count of 1 × 10^9/L, with normal white cell count, haemoglobin and clotting studies. Which is the most probable diagnosis in this case?",Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA),Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP),Pseudo-thrombocytopenia,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP),C,"The diagnosis of ITP is made in the presence of isolated thrombocytopenia with normal bone marrow and with no other identifiable cause for thrombocytopenia. AIHA and TTP would show manifest anaemia and haemolysis, not present here, whereas DIC would show an overtly abnormal clotting test profile. Pseudo-thrombocytopenia results from platelet clumping in the presence of ethylene-diamine-tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) but has no clinical manifestations in vivo. "
hematological system,214,A patient presents with acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML). Which of the following is the likely mechanism underlying leukaemogenesis?,Aberrant fusion of 2 genes,Impaired protein degradation,Over expression of cellular oncogene,Post-translational modification,Telomere shortening,A,"In APML, one of the retinoic acid receptor genes (RARA) is fused to PML in the great majority of patients as a result of the chromosomal translocation t(15; 17). APML is a haematological emergency with urgent chemotherapy induction treatment needed if suspected. Death due to abnormal coagulation either via bleeding or thrombosis is common and should be corrected and checked twice a day."
hematological system,215,"A 50 year old gentleman presents with pruritus. This is most marked after a hot shower. He is also having intermittent headaches and dizziness. Over the last few days he has noticed swelling of his left calf. Bloods reveal a raised haemoglobin, increased packed cell volume and mildly elevated platelets and white cells. JAK2 mutational analysis is positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Aspirin and Venesection,Aspirin,Venesection,Chlorambucil,Hydroxycarbamide,E,"This patient is most likely suffering from polycythaemia rubra vera. Given the presence of the JAK2 mutation and the swelling in the left calf this patient is at high risk of thrombosis and therefore hydroxycarbamide should be commenced. In those with low risk of thrombosis aspirin and phlebotomy is normally utilised. Myelosuppression should only be used in patients who are at high risk of thrombosis as myelosuppression increases risk of leukaemic transformation, however Hydroxycarbamide carries a low risk of this."
hematological system,216,A 28-year-old man presented with recurrent nose bleeds and iron deficiency anaemia. A chest x ray found a shadow over the right lung base and auscultation in this area revealed a bruit. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,von Willebrand's disease,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,B,"This is hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia characterised by bleeding from telangiectasia on mucous membranes such as the nose, mouth and gastrointestinal tract. Clinical examination reveals telangiectasia on the skin. Arteriovenous malformation may be seen in the lung (as in this case) or brain. "
hematological system,217,Which of the following patients with Hodgkin's disease has the worst prognosis in a patient with a raised ESR?,25-year-old man with cervical and mediastinal lymphadenopathy,25-year-old man with inguinal lymphadenopathy,25-year-old man with mediastinal and inguinal lymphadenopathy and pruritus,25-year-old woman with mediastinal and inguinal lymphadenopathy,25-year-old woman with mediastinal and inguinal lymphadenopathy and night sweats,E,Prognosis in Hodgkin's disease depends on staging and presence of B symptoms. The first patient has stage IIA disease (two lymph node areas on same side of diaphragm). The second patient has Stage IA disease (one lymph node area). The third and fourth patients have stage IIIA disease (disease in lymph nodes on both sides of diaphragm). Pruritus is not a B symptom and is not of prognostic significance. The fifth patient has stage IIIB disease (as night sweats are a B symptom). ESRgreater than30 with night sweats is a significant prognositc sign and impacts overal survivial as seen below. 
hematological system,218,A 55 year old female presents with shortness of breath on exertion and fatigue. She is found to have a pancytopenia on bloods with an elevated MCV. She is found to have antibodies for intrinsic factor and parietal cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Folate deficiency,Aplastic leukaemia,Leukaemia,Iron deficiency,Pernicious anaemia,E,The finding of macrocytic anaemia with autoantibodies to intrinsic factor and parietal cells is highly indicative of pernicious anaemia. In severe vitamin B 12 deficiency this can cause a pancytopenia. This excludes the other diagnoses.
hematological system,219,"A 30-year-old male patient presents with sudden deterioration and haematuria, 15 minutes after starting blood transfusion. His pulse rate is 120 beats per minute and blood pressure is 70/ 40 mmHg. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",ABO incompatibility,Anaphylaxis to anaesthetic agents,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Graft versus host disease,Rhesus incompatibility,A,"Immediate life-threatening reactions with intravascular haemolysis are caused by complement activating IgG or IgM antibodies. They are usually ABO antibodies and these reactions can occur after transfusion of a few millilitres of blood. There is nothing in the history to suggest anaphylaxis, DIC or Rhesus incompatibility.  The patient also has no risk described for transfusion associated Graft versus host disease."
hematological system,220,A 62-year-old male attends the Emergency Department with a severe nose bleed. He is known to have alcoholic cirrhosis. His investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 109 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 60 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Prothrombin time 17.5 s (11.5-15.5)   APPT 42 s (30-40)   Fibrinogen 0.7 g/L (1.8-5.4)    What is the most appropriate blood product for this patient?,Cryoprecipitate,Factor VIII,Platelets,Prothrombin complex concentrate,Whole blood,A,"The most significant abnormality is the low fibrinogen. Therefore the best product to correct the fibrinogen out of those given is cryoprecipitate. To correct a coagulopathy you need to aim for:  Fibrinogen greater than1.0 g/L Platelets greater than50 ×10^9/L PT and APTT less than1.5 upper range of normal  From the results, you can see the most significant abnormality is the low fibrinogen. The platelets are low and activated partial thromboplastin time/prothrombin time (APTT/PT) prolonged but not really sufficient to cause bleeding."
hematological system,221,A 50-year-old female presents with acute chest pain and dyspnoea. Examination reveals bilateral ankle oedema with 24-hour urine protein assessment showing 8 g/d (less than0.2). Which is the most likely explanation for these findings?,Factor V Leiden,Reduced antithrombin III levels,Reduced concentration of von Willebrand's factor,Reduced factor VIII,Reduced fibrinogen concentration,B,"This patient has developed nephrotic syndrome and appears to have had a thromboembolic event. The suggestion is that she has had nephrotic syndrome before developing the thromboembolism. Deranged coagulation associated with nephrotic syndrome is a consequence of AT III deficiency, increased fibrinogen and increased factor VIIIc."
hematological system,222,"A 30-year-old gentleman presents to the Emergency Department with a three-day history of tiredness and fever. On the day of presentation he also noticed bruising over his hands and feet and that he has not been passing water for the previous day. Blood investigations show a creatinine of 560 µmol/L, a haemoglobin of 70 g/L with prominent red cell fragments on blood film, and a platelet count of 10 × 10^9/L. The patient reports no prior illness. Which of the following is the established treatment for this condition?",Anti-complement therapy with blinotumumab,Dialysis,Fresh frozen plasma,Plasma exchange,Plasma exchange and dialysis,E,"The presentation is typical of diarrhoea negative (D- or atypical) haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), often difficult to discern from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) except for the prominent presence of oliguria/uraemia. Plasma exchange and dialysis are established supportive therapies for HUS. Diarrhoea positive (D+) HUS, associated typically with verotoxin-induced bloody diarrhoea, is treated with supportive care whereas negative (D-) HUS, not typically associated with bloody diarrhoea but sometimes associated with multisystem symptoms similar to TTP, should be urgently treated with plasmapheresis. Increasingly, the role of complement defects in atypical HUS is being defined and use of the complement inhibitor, eculizumab, appears useful in these instances. Blinotumumab is a monocolonal antibody used in the treatemtn of refractory B-ALL "
hematological system,223,In osteomyelitis which of the following statements is correct?,In the neonate it is commonly caused by anaerobes from the birth canal,Is frequently due to local blunt trauma,Is more common in the elderly,Is usually monofocal,Typically affects the epiphysis of the long bones,D,"In neonates the usual causative organisms are Streptococcus (group B), Staphylococcus aureus, and Gram positive bacteria. Local blunt trauma causing subperiostal haematoma plays a small role, however, these haematomas then become infected by haematogenous spread (which is the commonest cause). The most common age group affected is children aged 3-15 years. It can also be multifocal, affecting multiple bones simultaneously. The metaphyses of the long bones are most often affected due to the convoluted arrangement of end-arterioles trapping bacteria."
hematological system,224,A 35 year old female presents with menorrhagia. She also gives a history of epistaxis. Bloods reveal a normal prothrombin time and platelet count however a prolonged bleeding time and APTT. LFTs are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Prothrombin mutation,Factor V Leiden,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Haemophilia A,Von Willebrands disease,E,The symptoms and blood results are indicative of Von Willebrands disease which can vary in severity depending on the type. There can be quantitative defects of von Willebrands which plays a role in platelet adhesion or qualitative defects.
hematological system,225,A 62-year-old male is diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia and his investigations show that both Philadelphia chromosome and bcr/abl gene is present. What is the significance of the presence of the bcr/abl gene?,Acts on stem cell line DNA,Blocks apoptosis,Codes for the production of a tyrosine kinase in the leukaemic cells,Increases expression of granulocyte colony stimulating factor receptors on the cell membrane,Increases production of granulocyte colony stimulating factor,C,"The product of the bcr/abl translocation gene that is seen in 97% cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) is a constitutively active tyrosine kinase; this is responsible for the leukaemic process.  Inihibition with a Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor, Such as Imatanib, has lead to vast changes in the treatment landscape of CML and prevented patients from the inevitable progression to blast phase CML i.e Acute Myeloid Leukaemia."
hematological system,226,A 14-year-old boy presents with excessive bleeding from a tooth cavity following an extraction at the dentist. His investigations show:    Haemoglobin 132 g/L (130-180)   Platelet count 260 ×10^9/L (150-400)   White cell count 8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Prothrombin time 14 s (11.5-15.5)   Activated partial thromboplastin time 45 s (30-40)   Factor VIII 45 U/dL (50-150)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,von Willebrand's disease,E,"This young boy with excessive bleeding has a slightly raised APTT and slightly reduced factor VIII. Whilst the amount of factor VIII present in haemophilia A can vary, you would expect it to be much less than described here (in severe haemophilia there is less than1% of the normal level). In addition, the APTT is usually much more prolonged than described here. In haemophilia B it is factor IX which is reduced. von Willebrand's disease is, therefore, the correct answer here. Factor VIII is slightly reduced as von Willebrand factor is a protective carrier for factor VIII. DIC and ITP would typically be associated with thrombocytopenia."
hematological system,227,A 24 year old male with sickle cell anaemia presents with severe pleuritic chest pain. He is short of breath and has a cough. A CXR reveals increased multilobular opacities. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Myocardial Ischaemia,Pulmonary Embolus,Pneumonia,Myocarditis,Acute Chest Syndrome,E,"The most likely diagnosis is Acute chest syndrome due a vasoocclusive crisis. Patients present with fever, cough and pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath with minimal chest signs unless superimposed infection. Lower lobe and multi lobe consolidation is common in adults. There is pulmonary infarction secondary to occlusion of pulmonary microvasculature. There is is also rib ischaemia."
hematological system,228,Choose the correct statement regarding the storage conditions and shelf life of blood products.,Fresh frozen plasma is stored below −30°C for up to 24 months,Fresh frozen plasma is stored below −25°C for up to 36 months,Platelets are stored at 22°C for up to 10 days,Platelets are stored at 4°C for up to 5 days,Packed red cells are stored at 4°C for up to 25 days,B,"Fresh frozen plasma can be stored for up to 36 months below −25°C. It must not be refrozen once thawed.  The storage period of platelets depends on a number of factors, including the container material, platelet concentration and method of collection. In general, they can be stored at 22 +/- 2°C for up to 5 days with continuous gentle agitation. Storage up to 7 days is possible, but increases the risk of bacterial contamination which must be excluded (e.g. using bacterial assays) prior to administration.  Packed red cells may be stored for a maximum of 35 days at 4 +/- 2°C if an adenine supplemented anticoagulant is used - without this the maximum storage period is 28 days.  "
hematological system,229,"A 40-year-old gentleman presents to the Emergency Department with a two-week history of lethargy, low-grade fever and gum bleeding. He is obtunded. His full blood count shows a white cell count of 350 ×10^9/L, haemoglobin of 54 g/L and a platelet count of 23 ×10^9/L. Which of the following would be the most appropriate treatment option in this case?",Cytotoxic chemotherapy,Intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobials,Leukapheresis followed by cytotoxic chemotherapy,Transfusion of three units of red cell concentrate,Transfusion of one adult therapeutic dose of single donor platelets,C,"This question covers the presentation of acute leukaemia with hyperleukocytosis. Acute leukaemia can present with evidence of hyperleukocytosis. There is a predominance of CNS and chest symptomatology, and management should include reduction of the white cell mass by leukapheresis until the appropriate diagnosis is reached, whence the effect of leukapheresis should be consolidated with the appropriate cytotoxic therapy. Transfusion of red cell concentrate can worsen the hyperviscosity; thus transfusion of three units of red cell concentrate is incorrect. Whereas transfusion of platelet support and antimicrobials is also indicated, the most appropriate treatment would be leukapheresis followed by cytotoxics in the acute setting, thus eliminating cytotoxic chemotherapy, intravenous broad-spectrum antimicrobials and transfusion of one adult therapeutic dose of single donor platelets."
hematological system,230,"A 41-year-old African man has a history of multiple episodes of sudden onset of severe abdominal pain and back pain lasting for hours. Each time this happens, his peripheral blood smear demonstrates numerous sickled erythrocytes. A haemoglobin electrophoresis shows:    Hgb S 94%   Hgb F 5%   Hgb A2 1%    He now has increasing pain in his right groin radiating to the anterior aspect of the thigh and to the knee. His temperature was 38°C and examination of his hip revealed pain on internal rotation. A radiograph reveals irregular bony destruction of the femoral head. What is the organism most likely to be responsible for these findings?",Candida albicans,Clostridium perfringens,Group B Streptococcus,Salmonella species,Yersinia pestis,D,Salmonella osteomyelitis is seen in patients with sickle cell anaemia. Other organisms that are frequent causes for osteomyelitis with sickle cell anaemia include Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negatives such as Klebsiella. Why Salmonella species predominate in patients with sickle cell disease instead of Staphylococcus aureus is a matter of debate. 
hematological system,231,"A 19-year-old woman presents for the third time in the past eight months with acute abdominal pain and severe agitation. On the two previous occasions, she was admitted by the surgeons and discharged without significant intervention. She has started the oral contraceptive pill within the last year. According to her mother, the local GP has considered medicating her because of increasing anxiety. On examination her BP is 155/82 mmHg, pulse is 90 and regular, BMI 22. Her abdomen is generally tender although there are active bowel sounds. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 9.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 182 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 135 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 92 µmol/L (79-118)    You give her opiates for pain. Which of the following is the most important additional therapy during this acute attack?",IV cefuroxime and metronidazole,IV glucose,Oral chlorpromazine,Oral diazepam,Oral propranolol,B,"The history of three recent attacks of acute anxiety and abdominal pain coupled with starting the oral contraceptive pill raises the possibility of acute intermittent porphyria. Use of IV or oral glucose during an attack can lead to more rapid resolution of symptoms, and that would be the favoured approach here. Glucose inhibits haem synthesis, thereby reducing the production of porphyrin precursors. The UK guidelines recommend 5% glucose in 0.9% saline, initially at a rate of 2L/24h. You should avoid IV glucose in water solutions (e.g. dextrose 5%) as those can aggravate hyponatraemia.   The contraceptive pill should be withdrawn if possible. There is no indication of acute sepsis, so use of IV antibiotics is inappropriate. Phenothiazines may be used for restlessness, nausea and anxiety, and beta blockers have a role in the management of sympathetic activation. It is glucose however that will have the most impact in shortening the duration and severity of symptoms."
hematological system,232,"An 80-year-old man was seen at the Emergency Department following a minor fall and inability to weight bear. His right leg was shortened and externally rotated. x-Ray of the pelvis confirmed fracture neck of femur. However, the orthopaedic surgeon was concerned about the x ray appearance of the pelvis. Further enquiry revealed that he was becoming increasingly frail and prone to develop respiratory tract infections. He also complains of pain in the lower back worse at night. Apart from cachexia and pallor, his physical examination was normal. What is the likely diagnosis?",Chronic osteomyelitis,Metastatic carcinoma,Multiple myeloma,Osteoporosis,Paget's disease,C,"Multiple myeloma is a haematological malignancy of old age. It presents with bone pains particularly axial skeleton, pathological fractures and features of immunosuppression, as suggested by recurrent chest infections in this case. x Rays show osteolytic lesions that are most common in the axial skeleton. Metastatic carcinoma is a possibility, but the patient would be expected to have symptoms of the primary malignancy, for example, prostate, lungs. Osteoporosis and Paget's disease both can present with pathological fractures, but generalised cachexia and recurrent chest infections are against them. Chronic osteomyelitis is more likely to present with pain in the joint, pyrexia or loss of the joint."
hematological system,233,Which of the following statements regarding thrombocytosis is correct?,Erythropoietin is the key hormone in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation,May occur as a response to exercise,Occurs exclusively in essential thrombocythaemia,Secondary thrombocytosis is an indication for hydroxyurea therapy,The most common cause is essential thrombocythaemia,B,"The most common cause of thrombocytosis is a reactive thrombocytosis. Thrombocythaemia may occur in any of the myeloproliferative disorders, particularly polycythaemia rubra vera (PRV). Thrombopoietin is the key hormone in the regulation of megakaryocyte differentiation. Secondary thrombocytosis does not place the patient at risk for haemostatic or cardiovascular events."
hematological system,234,The blood to be used for an exchange transfusion in a neonate should fulfil which of the following criteria?,Any blood less than 5-days-old,Any plasma reduced whole blood in CPD (citrate phosphate dextrose/anticoagulant),Plasma reduced whole blood in CPD less than 5-days-old and irradiated,"Plasma reduced whole blood in CPD less than 5-days-old, irradiated and Rh positive",Plasma reduced whole blood in CPD which is irradiated,C,"An exchange transfusion requires blood which is plasma reduced whole blood, irradiated and less than 5-days-old. The Rh group should either be Rh negative or identical to the neonate, to avoid haemolytic transfusion reaction in the neonate. "
hematological system,235,Which of the following statements relates to acquired sideroblastic anaemia?,Haemosiderinuria is a feature,Has increased methaemoglobinaemia,It is characterised by the presence of ringed sideroblasts in the peripheral blood,It shows increased haptoglobin,There may be some response to pyridoxine therapy,E,Sideroblasts are found in marrow. Haptoglobin falls during haemolysis and may climb with 'acute phase' response. There is an occasional response to pyridoxine. Methaemoglobinaemia and haemosiderinuria are features of intravascular haemolysis.
hematological system,236,"A 74-year-old man is being managed at the haematology/oncology clinic for suspected myeloma. He complains of symptoms of increasing shortness of breath over the past few weeks, with increased lethargy, decreased exercise tolerance, and increasing lower limb oedema. On examination he looks pale, his BP is 139/81 mmHg, pulse 89. His heart sounds are normal, but there are bilateral crackles on auscultation of the chest and he has pitting lower limb oedema.

He has a mixed picture of heart failure and proteinuria which is likely to be due to both cardiac and renal amyloid deposition. Given his degree of hypoalbuminaemia, it is likely that light chains would be easily detectable in the urine. AA amyloidosis occurs in conjunction with systemic inflammatory conditions, cystatin C amyloidosis in conjunction with Icelandic hereditary cerebral haemorrhage and amyloidosis, and beta protein precursor amyloidosis with Alzheimer's disease and Down's syndrome. Treatment is driven by chemotherapy for the underlying myeloma."
hematological system,237,A patient with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia presents for check up. Over the last few months she has noticed lumps in her neck and axilla which have grown rapidly. She has lost weight and complains of being feverish. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Poorly differentiated high grade lymphoma,Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,CMV infection,EBV infection,Progression of CLL,A,"The history of rapidly growing lymphadenopathy, fever and weight loss on a background of CLL suggests Richters transformation where CLL transforms in to a poorly differentiated high grade lymphoma. It is thought to occur in approximately 5 to 10% of patients. A lymph node biopsy is required to confirm this is the case."
hematological system,238,A 34-year-old Asian lady presented with tiredness and lethargy.

However, the MCV here is disproportionately low. This combined with a raised HbA2 makes the diagnosis of beta-thalassaemia trait the most likely diagnosis.  andquot;The diagnosis of beta thalassemia minor usually is suggested by the presence of an isolated, mild microcytic anemia, target cells on the peripheral blood smear, and a normal red blood cell count. An elevation of Hb A2 (2 alpha-globin chains complexed with 2 delta-globin chains) demonstrated by electrophoresis or column chromatography confirms the diagnosis of beta thalassemia trait. The Hb A2 level in these patients usually is approximately 4-6%. In rare cases of concurrent severe iron deficiency, the increased Hb A2 level may not be observed, although it becomes evident with iron repletion. The increased Hb A2 level also is not observed in patients with the rare delta-beta thalassemia trait.andquot;^1  "

Most commonly, the drug helps stabilise the disease or produce a slow, minor improvement. Alpha interferon at 2 million U/m^2 subcutaneously three times a week for 12-18 months can be used to salvage relapsed or refractory hairy cell leukaemia. It is also used in Adult T-lymphocytic Leukaemia but not in the other conditions mentioned. "
hematological system,240,A 16-year-old boy presents with a haemarthrosis that developed in his left knee following an injury in the garden. His investigations show:    Platelet count 260 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Prothrombin time 13 s (11.5-15.5)   Activated partial thromboplastin time 80 s (30-40)   Factor VIII 110 IU/dl (50-150)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Antiphospholipid syndrome,Antithrombin III deficiency,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,von Willebrand's disease,D,An elevated activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) could be due to:  Treatment with heparin Haemophilia von Willebrand's disease Antiphospholipid syndrome.  A normal factor VIII would suggest haemophilia B where there is lack of factor IX. A prolonged APTT can be seen in von Willebrand's disease but factor VIII activity would be low. The presentation is not consistent with antiphospholipid syndrome which is associated with thrombosis rather than haemorrhage. Antithrombin III deficiency is also associated with thrombosis and is most commonly acquired in the setting of nephrotic syndrome.
hematological system,241,"A 15-year-old girl was admitted with anemia, chest infection and thrombocytopenia. She was treated and her symptoms had regressed. She was brought again with fever and the same symptoms a few days later. She also seems to have features of meningitis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",AML,ALL,Aplastic anemia,CML,CLL,B,The age supports the diagnosis of ALL along with the given clinical picture. Similar picture can be seen in aplastic anemia but meningitis supports more towards ALL (leukemic meningitis)
hematological system,242,A 48-year-old nulliparous woman feels tired all the time. Her periods are regular but have always lasted for at least 10 days. Choose the single most appropriate intial investigation?,High vaginal swab,Serum hemoglobin concentration,TFT,None,Abdominal US,B,Feeling tired all the time and prolonged period suggest anemia. So serum Hb should be done initially
hematological system,243,A 55-year-old female presented with anemia and dysphagia. There is a feeling of something stuck in the throat. The esophagus can’t be negotiated beyond the crico- pharynx. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Foreign body,Plummer vinson syndrome,Pharyngeal carcinoma,Barret’s esophagus,Esophageal carcinoma,B,The picture fits two D/D. 1. Plummer Vinson syndrome 2. Oesophagial carcinoma. Lower oesophagial stricture is more common in Ca. So presenting case is likely a case of Plummer Vinson syndrome. It can be differentiated by the type of anemia. If it is IDA diagnosis is Plummer Vinson syndrome
hematological system,244,"A 53 year old male presents as he has been suffering from flushing. This is worst after alcohol and caffeinated drinks. He has intermittent diarrhoea, abdominal pain and wheezing. On examination there is evidence of a right sided abdominal mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lymphoma,Asthma,MEN type 1,Phaeochromocytoma,Carcinoid Tumour,E,"The symptoms described here are that of the carcinoid syndrome. Carcinoid tumours are neuroendocrine tumours and the majority occur in the GI tract.  They secrete many bioactive substances which includes 5 hydroxytryptamine, prostaglandins, somatostatin and bradykinin and this leads to the symptoms. Large tumours can lead to obstruction or carcinoid heart disease which predominantly effects the right side of the heart. They may present once they metastasise to the liver. Chromogranin A is useful for screening and is very sensitive but not specific.  Diagnosis however utilises the measurement of 24 hour urinary excretion of 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid. During this test certain foods and drugs should be avoided."
hematological system,245,"A 75-year-old male is admitted with tiredness and lethargy and is found to have an enlarged right supraclavicular mass. Past medical history reveals that he had developed acrocyanosis six months previously and two months ago, had been admitted with a chest infection for which he was treated with co-amoxiclav. Investigations reveal:  blood film red cell auto-agglutination direct antiglobulin test positive cold agglutinin test positive.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bronchial carcinoma,Drug-induced haemolysis,Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL),Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH),D,"The results are consistent with an autoimmune haemolytic screen caused by a cold antibody. Drug-induced haemolysis does not give these results. Bronchial Ca can give rise to an autoimmune haemolytic process but the antibody is usually warm; you do not get red cell agglutination or a positive cold agglutinin test. PCH is a rare syndrome of acute intravascular haemolysis after exposure to cold caused by the Donath-Landsteiner antibody. It typically follows a viral illness or syphilis and is usually self-limiting. The results and clinical description of acrocyanosis are consistent with a cold autoantibody (cold autoimmune haemolytic anaemia). The antibody attaches to the RBCs in the peripheral circulation where the blood is cold, causing agglutination of the RBCs in the small vessels leading to the acrocyanosis. It is an IgM Ab that can fix complement and cause both intra- and extravascluar haemolysis. It can be a primary phenomenon (idiopathic cold haemagglutinin disease) or secondary to infection, for example, Mycoplasma pneumoniae or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or secondary to lymphoma. The acrocyanosis developed before the chest infection, and in view of the lymphadenopathy, then NHL is the likely cause."
hematological system,246,"A 35-year-old male, morbidly obese with a BMI of 40 kg/m^2, is assessed by a multi-disciplinary team prior to undergoing bariatric surgery with gastric bypass (Roux-en-Y procedure). Assessment of nutritional status and vitamins pre-operatively shows no deficiency. Six months after the procedure on routine follow-up it is noted the patient has a haemoglobin of 80 g/L with macrocytosis. The patient admits that he has not been fully compliant with the supplementation suggested by his caring team. Which is the most probable nutritional deficiency accounting for this presentation?",Vitamin A,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Vitamin D,Selenium,Thiamine,B,"Bariatric patients are at an increased risk of developing vitamin B12 deficiency because their digestive tracts have been altered in such a way as to interfere with the natural absorption of this vitamin. In patients who have had gastric bypass surgery, most of the stomach and duodenum are bypassed, limiting the breakdown of vitamin B12 and its subsequent binding with intrinsic factor. Deficiencies of folate, zinc, vitamin D, calcium and thiamine have also been observed in those undergoing bariatric surgery, but would not solely account for the clinical presentation described above as they would present with skin rashes (zinc), beriberi and Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (thiamine) or osteomalacia (vitamin D).

hematological system,247,"Whilst being investigated for infertility, a 30-year-old woman is noted to have some bruising on her limbs with a palpable spleen on abdominal examination. Investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 100 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 110 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 60 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Lymphocytes 2 ×10^9/L (1.5-4)   Monocytes 0.8 ×10^9/L (0-0.8)   Eosinophils 0.3 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   Basophils 0.7 ×10^9/L (0-0.1)   Myelocytes 40 ×10^9/L -   Myeloblasts 4 ×10^9/L -   Platelet count 900 ×10^9/L (150-400)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute myeloid leukaemia,Acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML),Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Essential thrombocythaemia,Myelofibrosis,C,"The features of this blood film are anaemia, thrombocytosis, neutrophilia with roughly 55% neutrophils, 40% myelocytes with less than 5% blast cells. This is typical of chronic myeloid leukaemia which usually has associated tender splenomegaly. Usually, the Philadelphia chromosome is present in 95% of cases. Acute leukaemia is defined as blast cells constituting over 30% of cell type present. Chronic myeloid leukaemia often ends in acute blastic transformation after a mean duration of approximately four years. Essential Thrombocytosis presents typically with an isolated platelet count.  Myelofibrosis presents with a leukoerythroblastic blood film with tear drop red blood cells and nucleated red blood cells with splenomegaly and anaemia. The absence of characteristic mutations such as BCR-ABL is important in the diagnosis.  APML is a haematological emergenecy and treatment should be started within hours of diagnosis."
hematological system,248,"A 62-year-old gentleman is being investigated for normochromic, normocytic anaemia. He is diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type II and essential hypertension. His haemoglobin is stable at 95 g/L (normal range 130-162 g/L), his creatinine clearance is calculated at 45 ml/min (normal range 97-137 ml/min), ferritin at 50 µg/L (normal range 12-300 µg/L) and his serum erythropoietin level comes back at 8 (normal range: 4-24 mU/mL). Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",Check haemoglobin at 6-monthly intervals,Commencement of subcutaneous darbepoietin,Intravenous iron supplementation,Transfusion aiming for Hb of 100-120 g/L,Transfusion aiming for Hb of 120-140 g/L,C,"This patient has CKD stage 3A (borderline 3B). Renal-related anaemia can start to develop at this stage as alteration in erythropoietin production occurs. It is worsened by reduced dietary intake of iron due to anorexia, impaired intestinal absorption of iron, toxic effect of uraemia on erythroid precursors and reduced red blood cell survival. It is imperative that renal patients avoid repeated blood transfusion, unless in extremis, so that future renal transplantation will not be precluded by allo-sensitisation. Before initiation of recombinant erythropoiesis-stimulating agents the patient should be iron replete. The serum ferritin and transferrin saturation should be checked, as most patients will be iron deficient. Targets for treatment are:  Haemoglobin 105-125 g/L Ferritin: greater than100 µg/L in pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients, greater than200 µg/L in haemodialysis patients Transferrin saturation greater than20%  This patient should also be referred to a nephrologist, as early assessment of the causes of his renal impairment is beneficial. Patients with CKD stage 3A, who are non-proteinuric, have a low risk of progression and can usually be managed in the community following an initial assessment by a nephrologist. Those with proteinuria are usually managed in secondary care, as the protein is directly toxic to the tubules and this typically results in progression of renal impairment."
hematological system,249,"A 67-year-old woman presents with acute severe back pain. She is normally fit and well, but there is a strong family history of osteoporosis.

The globulin level is raised at 46 g/L (globulin level = total protein − albumin. In this case, 76 − 30 = 46). A normal level should be below 36 g/L. This together with normocytic anaemia and probable vertebral collapse would be highly suggestive of multiple myeloma. She needs serum immunoelectrophoresis to look for a paraprotein, serum free light chains, urinary Bence-Jones protein, an MRI for bony lesions and bone marrow biopsy. The hyperphosphataemia in multiple myeloma is due to reduced renal excretion which may be directly due to renal impairment or interference with excessive protein load. Myeloma treatment in the last 10 years had changed vastly with the prognosis and overal survivial improving significantly."
hematological system,250,A mild lymphocytosis of 15 × 10^9/l with a few smear cells is reported on a full blood count result in a 70-year-old asymptomatic man attending clinic for an annual review. Which of the following would be the most essential investigation to establish a diagnosis of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)?,CT scan of chest abdomen and pelvis,Lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) levels,Peripheral blood flow cytometry,Presence of palpable cervical lymphadenopathy,Presence of smear cells on the blood film,C,"Flow cytometry showing a specific pattern of monoclonal B cell proliferation (CD19/5 coexpressing, CD23 positive, light chain restricted B cell population) is diagnostic of CLL. CT scan and LDH are investigations needed to complete staging but not essential for diagnosis. Smear cells are reported in other lymphoproliferative as well as benign lymphocytosis and merely indicate fragile lymphocytes which are artefactually smeared on the glass slide. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be seen in CLL but can also be seen in any other cause of lymphadenopathy (for example, viral infections, adenopathy secondary to local dental infection)."
hematological system,251,A 35 year old man with a HIV for approximately 10 years presents after noticing lesions on his neck and lower legs. These are papular brownish lesions. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pityriasis Versicolor,Bacillary Angiomatosis,Necrobiosis Lipoidica,Kaposis sarcoma,Bowens Disease,D,The most likely diagnosis is Kaposis sarcoma as evidenced by the long history of HIV (suggesting low CD4 count and high viral count) and the description of the lesion. Necrobiosis Lipoidica is seen in diabetes mellitus. Bowens disease is a squamous cell carcinoma and can look similar to psoriasis. Bacillary angiomatosis is a vascular proliferative disorder following bartonella infection and can appear similar.
hematological system,252,"A 35-year-old lady diagnosed with Hodgkin disease treated with autologous stem cell transplantation has now relapsed two years post-transplant. She is started on salvage chemotherapy prior to possible allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. She has cytotoxic related cytopenias, including anaemia (70 g/L) and thrombocytopenia (10 × 10^9/L) and is symptomatic, with lethargy and bruising, thus requiring regular blood product support. Which is the most appropriate blood product for this patient?",Irradiate prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplant only,Irradiated platelet concentrates only,Irradiated red cell and platelet concentrates,Irradiated red cell concentrates only,Standard red cell and platelet concentrates,C,"The patient has several indications for irradiated blood product administration. Transfusion associated GvHD has been reported in Hodgkin disease and irradiation for all products is suggested lifelong in Hodgkin lymphoma. Autologous bone marrow transplant recipients should receive irradiated products for up to six months from start of conditioning. As this patient has a history of Hodgkin lymphoma, lifelong irradiated blood product administration is the correct choice. Transfusion associated GvHD is caused by white blood cells contaminating the transfused products acting against the recipient bone marrow; irradiation eliminates these white blood cells. Blood product irradiation is used to eliminate the risk of transfusion related graft versus host disease, a universally fatal complication of blood transfusion. It is worthwhile to review the indicated instances where it is imperative that irradiated blood products are used. "
hematological system,253,"A 60 year old male presents with weight loss, night sweats, fever and fatigue. He has had a change in his bowel habit. On examination he has evidence of inguinal and axillary lymphadenopathy and the patient states these have increased in size quickly. There is also hepatosplenomegaly and a separate abdominal mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hodgkins Lymphoma,Tuberculosis,High grade non Hodgkins lymphoma,Colorectal Cancer,Low grade non Hodgkins lymphoma,C,This patient presents with B symptoms and rapidly growing lymphadenopathy which suggests a high grade Non Hodgkins lymphoma. In low grade there is often no evidence of B symptoms. Hodgkins disease is less likely as this usually presents with cervical painless lymphadenopathy.
hematological system,254,A patient with hepatitis C presents with arthralgia. He has evidence of purpuric lesions and there is evidence of proteinuria and haematuria. Cryoglobulins are elevated. The rheumatoid factor is monoclonal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Amyloidosis,Type I cryoglobulinaemia,Type 3 cryoglobulinaemia,Multiple myeloma,Type 2 cryoglobulinaemia,E,"Cryoglobulins are single or mixed immunoglobulins that show reversible precipitation at cold temperatures. There are 3 types. There are numerous causes. Type 1 cryoglobulinaemia is due to a monoclonal antibody, usually IgM, and is associated with myeloma and waldenstroms. It normally presents with acrocyanosis, retinal haemorrhage and Raynauds. Type II and III are due to rheumatoid factor (usually IgM) binding to polyclonal IgG. In type II the rheumatoid factor is monoclonal and in type III is it polyclonal. It normally presents as described here and can lead to glomerulonephritis. It is associated with CLL, chronic liver disease (in hepatitis C, 40 to 50% have evidence of cryoglobulinaemia), infections and connective tissue disease."
hematological system,255,"A patient is diagnosed with pre eclampsia. She is currently on dalteparin for a DVT. It is noted however that she is bleeding from her venflon sites and nose. You notice purpura on her arms and legs. Bloods reveal a low platelet count, prolonged PT and APTT, low fibrinogen and largely elevated D dimers. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,HELLP syndrome,Excessive dalteparin treatment,von Willebrands disease,A,"The clinical features and bloods are suggestive of DIC. Pre eclampsia is a recognised cause. The HELLP syndrome is associated with haemolysis and reduced platelets but also deranged LFTs and symptoms such as headache, visual disturbance and jaundice. Excessive dalteparin would not lead to the clinical features or blood pattern. On Willebrands you may see a prolonged APTT but not the other features. ITP is associated with low platelets and not the other features and coagulation is normal."

Molecular studies show the patient to be BCR-ABL transcript positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy?,Chemotherapy,Haemopoietic stem cell transplant,Hydroxycarbamide,Interferon,"Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor, e.g.imatinib",E,"The above presentation and laboratory findings are typical for chronic phase chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML). Chemotherapy is incorrect because chemotherapy is only used in the blast crisis phase of CML. Hydroxycarbamide and interferon are now outdated treatments for CML. Stem cell transplant is not performed first in patients with CML since the advent of specifically targeted therapy for the BCR-ABL transcript positive leukaemias, that is, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which are now the gold standard therapy for CML. Hence treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor is the correct answer."
hematological system,257,An 82-year old man presents to his general practitioner with a six-month history of fatigue and increasing exertional dyspnoea. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 75 g/L (130-180)   MCV 112 fL (80-96)   White blood cells 3.12 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 34% -   Blasts 1% -   Platelets 12 ×10^9/L (150-400)    A bone marrow aspirate stained with Perls' stain showed ring sideroblasts. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Aplastic anaemia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Metastatic bone marrow infiltration,Myelodysplastic syndrome,Myelofibrosis,D,"The patient has a macrocytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia with a small number of circulating blasts. This suggests a diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome, and this is supported by the finding of ring sideroblasts in the marrow. Ring sideroblasts contain an abnormally high concentration of iron, usually stored in perinuclear mitochondria. Perls' stain (which stains for iron) shows this iron deposition as a dark ring around the margin of the nucleus. Aplastic anaemia would present much earlier.  CML presents with neutrophillia +/- thrombocytosis, basophillia and splenomegaly.  Myelofibrosis presents with splenomegaly and a leukoerythroblastic blood film."
hematological system,258,A patient with end stage renal disease is receiving haemodialysis and erythropoietin. Which of the following does erythropoietin therapy cause?,Hypotension,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Myositis,Osteoporosis,Seizures,E,"Hypertension is a frequent problem associated with erythropoietin and may induce seizures. A particular symptom is the onset of sudden stabbing migraine-like headache and should raise awareness to the possibility of hypertensive crisis. Other adverse effects of treatment with erythropoietin include:  Hyperkalaemia in uraemic patients Increased PCV (especially with misuse by normal individuals) Thrombocythaemia Shunt thrombosis Induction of iron deficiency Skin rashes Urticaria, and Flu-like illness.  "
hematological system,259,What is the most likely complication of aplastic anaemia?,Thromboses,Blood transfusion related complications,GI haemorrhage,Infections,Splenic infarct,D,Aplastic anaemia leads to a pancytopenia. The most common complication is infection and this can lead to overwhelming sepsis. Bleeding is another major complications.

hematological system,261,"A 60 year old male presents with fatigue, night sweats and weight loss. He has also noticed his stomach feeling bloated and distended. On examination there is evidence of splenomegaly. Bloods reveal a normochromic, normocytic anaemia, elevated white cell counts and slightly elevated platelets. A blood film reveals myeloid cells are various stages of development. Cytogenetic analysis and PCR reveals the Philadelphia chromosome and BCR ABL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Myelofibrosis,Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Acute myeloid leukaemia,Multiple Myeloma,C,"The Philadelphia chromosome leading to the production of BCR ABL is pathognomonic of CML. These symptoms are often presenting features and platelets can be normal, low or elevated. Patients can also present in an acute blast crisis. There may be left upper quadrant pain due to splenic enlargement."
hematological system,262,"A 30-year-old female presents to the antenatal clinic with her first pregnancy. During the interview, she reports that she has been entirely well but her sister had suffered a deep vein thrombosis in her second pregnancy. A thrombophilia screen shows that she is heterozygous for factor V Leiden (FVL). Which is the most appropriate action for this patient?",She should be informed to seek medical attention if she becomes aware of calf swelling or pain,She should be treated with aspirin 75 mg daily,She should be treated with prophylactic low molecular weight heparin,She should be treated with prophylactic unfractionated heparin,She should receive warfarin,A,"Although she is heterozygous for factor V Leiden, she has not had a previous thrombotic event. There is no need to anticoagulate her throughout pregnancy. However, she is at increased risk (pregnant and FVL) and should be very alert to the symptoms and signs of a thrombotic event. There is no evidence of benefit from aspirin to reduce her thrombotic risk based on her risk score.  Patient with high risk scores for thrombo-embolic disease during pregnancy should be treated with either aspirin or low molecular weight heparin. Those with significant thrombophillia history should be managed in conjunction with a haematologist. "
hematological system,263,A patient is undergoing a blood transfusion when she begins to feel feverish and unwell. She is tachycardic and hypotensive and is suffering from flank pain. Her coombs test is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Febrile non haemolytic reaction,Sepsis,Bacterial contamination,Transfusion related lung injury,Acute haemolytic reaction,E,The history is indicative of a transfusion reaction. As the direct coombs test is positive. ABO incompatibility is the cause. The transfusion must be stopped immediately and help and haematology input must be sought. In febrile non haemolytic reactions and anaphylactic reactions the DAT test would be negative. In TRALI you would expect respiratory symptoms to be predominant. In anaphylaxis you would expect oedema and urticaria.
hematological system,264,A 40-year-old lady who has been a smoker since she was a teenager has the following blood result: Hb 19. What hormone should you check?,Aldosterone,Cortisol,Erythropoietin,T4,TSH,C,Smoking causes raised carboxyhemoglobin level causing hypoxemia and raised erythropoeitin which leads to raised hemoglobin level (secondary polycythemia)
hematological system,265,"A 62-year-old Caribbean man with new onset type 2 diabetes presents to the Emergency Department. He has increasing lethargy and tiredness since starting a sulphonylurea a few days earlier. On examination he has jaundiced sclerae, his BP is 135/72 mmHg, and pulse is 95. His mucous membranes look a little pale. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (13.5-17.7)   Heinz bodies seen -   White cell count 10.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 198 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 88 µmol/L (79-118)   Bilirubin 80 µmol/L (less than17)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Cold agglutinin disease,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Obstructive jaundice,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria,C,"G-6-PD deficiency is more common in patients of Afro-Caribbean origin. Sulphonylureas are a class of drugs associated with increased risk of red cell oxidation and the absence of G-6-PD leads to haemolytic anaemia and increased levels of unconjugated bilirubin. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia would be associated with a more chronic course, and the close proximity to use of sulphonylurea is much more suggestive of G-6-PD deficiency. Cold agglutinins are associated with mycoplasma or haematological malignancy. Obstructive jaundice would not usually be associated with anaemia. Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) presents with episodes of haemolysis. Venous thrombosis usually presents at a younger age."
hematological system,266,"A 61-year-old man underwent a surgery in which ileal resection had been done. He complains of fatigue, headache, and heart racing. Investigations: MCV 108fL, Hgb 8.9g/dL. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Vit B12 deficiency,Iron deficiency,Folate deficiency,Hemolytic anemia,Anemia of chronic disease,A,Vit B12 is absorbed mostly in ileum. As ileal resection is done B12 is not absorbed leading to megaloblastic anaemia
hematological system,267,A 56-year-old man is being pre-assessed for an elective cholecystectomy. He has had two bouts of acute cholecystitis in the last twelve months but no other co-morbidities and no history of having a previous blood transfusion. What should be the request to the blood bank?,Cross match for 3 units only,Group and Save as well as cross match,"Group and Save, direct Coombs' Test and a cross match for 2 units","Group and Save, direct Coombs' Test and a cross match for 3 units",Group and Save only,E,A 'group and save' is adequate for elective surgeries and is standard practise in most modern blood banks. This will involve blood grouping and its confirmation as well as an antibody screen. Other options include crossmatch and a direct Coombs' Test (DAT) which are often done only if the antibody screen test is positive. These are not routinely done for elective surgery unless the patient has had a recent blood transfusion or a history of previous known red cell antibodies.
hematological system,268,A 45-year-old lady is found to have thymoma. Which one of the following conditions is associated with thymoma?,Acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL),Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML),Myelofibrosis (MF),Pure red cell aplasia,Thrombocytosis,D,"Originally, thymoma was cited as the primary cause of acquired pure red cell aplasia. However, subsequent studies revealed that thymomas caused only 2 of 37 cases of pure red cell aplasia. Conversely, only 7% of patients with thymomas had pure red cell aplasia. T-cell mediated erythroid rejection is considered the mechanism for the production of pure red cell aplasia in patients with thymomas. This is supported by evidence that a subgroup of T cells in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is responsible for pure red cell aplasia. Thymomas are usually not associated with malignant haematologial disorders such as ALL or AML or proliferative disorders like MF.  They can be associated with immune disroders like thrombocytopaenia but not thrombocytosis.  "
hematological system,269,A 70-year-old male is diagnosed with multiple myeloma and is treated with melphalan and prednisolone. Which of the following when added to this chemotherapeutic regime would be expected to improve survival?,Cyclosporin,Interferon alpha,Methotrexate,Simvastatin,Thalidomide,E,Significant improvements in survival may be expected through the addition of thalidomide to standard chemotherapeutic regimes. Studies suggest a significant improvement at both two years and five years with thalidomide. 
hematological system,270,"A 12 year old girl presents with profuse diarrhoea. It was initially watery and then became bloody. She was unwell with fever, abdominal pain, petechial rash and vomiting. Bloods reveal a low haemoglobin, LDH and bilirubin, low platelets and acute renal failure. Coombs test is negative. What other features would likely be found on blood film?",Fragmented Red Cells,Target cells,Bite Cells,Howell Jolly bodies,Ellipocytes,A,"The most likely diagnosis is haemolytic uraemic syndrome with the triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Coombs negative), thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. It commonly follows infection with E Coli 0157:H7 and therefore bloody diarrhoea. It presents as above with petechia or purpura. On a peripheral blood film fragmented red cells will be observed."
hematological system,271,"A middle aged lady presented with fever, altered sensorium, bleeding gums and jaundice. Laboratory investigations: deranged renal function tests, normal PT/APTT, fragmented RBCs and low platelets. What’s the most likely diagnosis?",Cholesterol emboli,HUS (hemolytic uremic syndrome),TTP (thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura),Hepatorenal syndrome,Sepsis,C,"Fever and altered sensorium suggest the diagnosis of TTP. Also in TTP there is fragmented RBC which is present here(Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura leads to increased amounts of large von Willebrand factor which then attach to activated platelets and mediate further platelet aggregation. Platelets end up being removed and the resulting fibrin strand formation remains. These fibrin strands along with the stress from the blood flow cause fragmentation of the red blood cells, leading to schistocyte formation. In TTP, a schistocyte count between 3–10% is common, but >1% is suggestive of the disease.) There is low platelet counts"
hematological system,272,A 32-year-old man was prescribed an oral antibiotic for a urinary tract infection. Two days later he noticed that his urine was increasingly dark in colour. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 85 g/L (130-180)   Reticulocytes 147 ×10^9/L (25-85)    Blood film: marked anisopoikilocytosis and bite cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute myeloid leukaemia,Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Haemoglobin H disease,Hereditary spherocytosis,Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria,B,"Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria (PCH) is a rare type of autoimmune haemolytic anaemia (AIHA) occurring primarily in children. The classic symptom of PCH is a sudden onset of haemoglobinuria following exposure to cold, even for a few minutes. Symptoms may occur minutes to hours following exposure to cold. Haemoglobinuria is not always present because in some persons with PCH the autoantibody level is not high enough to cause intravascular haemolysis. PCH is usually of abrupt onset in the setting of an infectious disease. Given the patient's age and the specific history, in this case, the diagnosis is unlikely to be PCH. If the diagnosis were hereditary spherocytosis then the blood film would show spherocytes. In haemoglobin H disease the typical inclusions can be demonstrated in erythrocytes stained with brilliant cresyl blue and a chronic microcytic, hypochromic anaemia would be present. Haemolytic anaemia may be precipitated by sulfonamides and also by penicillins. This gentleman may have been treated with trimethoprim or a penicillin which then caused AIHA with the typical blood film. The most appropriate answer to this question is autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, given the patient's age, the lack of history of exposure to cold, and the history which is given of antibiotic prescription."
hematological system,273,Which of the following is utilised in monitoring venesection therapy for haemochromatosis?,Liver transaminases,Total Iron binding capacity,Transferrin Saturation,Ferritin,Iron levels,D,Ferritin levels are utilised for monitoring venesection therapy.
hematological system,274,Which of the following is the most common cause of familial thrombophilia?,Antithrombin deficiency,Antiphospholipid syndrome,Factor V Leiden mutation,Protein C and S deficiencies,Prothrombin mutation,C,Factor V Leiden mutation leads to a mutated factor V which is less sensitive to activated protein C mediated inactivation. It is an autosomal dominant condition and is the most common cause of familial thrombophilia.
hematological system,275,"You are called to the Emergency Department to assess a 21-year-old student who has presented with bloody diarrhoea. The diarrhoea started two weeks previously and was associated with increasing nausea and malaise and mild swelling of the lower limbs. She was having difficulty passing urine. She had eaten steak from the local butcher at a friend's barbeque the day before developing diarrhoea. On examination, she was pale with evidence of petechiae over her legs. Her face appeared puffy. Blood pressure was 160/95 mmHg. She was apyrexial but had a tachycardia and crackles on inspiration at both lung bases. There was an old appendicectomy scar in the right iliac fossa. Investigations showed:    Haemoglobin 85 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 13.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 9.5 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Platelets 35 ×10^9/L (150-400)   PT 12 s (11.5-15.5)   APTT 34 s (30-40)   Fibrinogen 4 g/L (1.8-5.4)   Serum sodium 139 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 6.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 40 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 411 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum albumin 27 g/L (37-49)   Dipstick urine Blood ++ Protein +    What is the single most important next investigation to determine the diagnosis?",ASO titres,Blood film analysis,Renal tract ultrasound,Transthoracic echocardiogram,Urine microscopy,B,"This patient has haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). It typically presents with a triad of:  acute renal failure (ARF) microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, and thrombocytopenia with normal clotting.  HUS is a complication of infection with verocytotoxin producing Escherichia coli usually of the serotype 0157:H7. Toxins produced in the intestine enter the blood and bind to endothelial cells in target organs. Endothelial cell damage leads to platelet and fibrin deposition with resultant fragmentation of circulating red blood cells and microvascular occlusion. The syndrome has also been reported after infections with coxsackie, echovirus and Shigella. HUS is characterised by the sudden onset of haemolytic anaemia with fragmentation of red blood cells, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure after a prodromal illness of acute gastroenteritis often with bloody diarrhoea. Clinical signs include increasing pallor, haematuria, oliguria and purpura. Jaundice is occasionally seen. Hypertension may be present. Typical results show an anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and often a neutrophilia. Blood film shows fragmented erythrocytes. Urea and electrolytes are typical of acute renal failure. There is normal coagulation and fibrinogen. Neurological complications include:  stroke, seizure and coma occur in 25% of patients rarely pancreatitis, and pleural and pericardial effusions.  Approximately 5% of patients will develop end-stage renal failure. Long-term renal sequelae range from proteinuria to chronic renal failure. Therapy is supportive with:  correction of anaemia correction of uraemia by early dialysis strict fluid balance, and treatment of hypertension.  Major differential diagnosis is:  Sepsis with DIC - presents with abnormalities of clotting parameters. TTP - thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura presents with microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenic purpura, neurologic abnormalities, fever, and renal disease.  Renal abnormalities tend to be more severe in HUS. Although once considered variants of a single syndrome, recent evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of TTP and HUS is different. Patients with TTP lack a plasma protease that is responsible for the breakdown of von Willebrand factor (vWF) multimers and these accumulate in the plasma. The activity of this protease is normal in patients with HUS. Until the test for vWF protease activity becomes available, differentiation between HUS and TTP is based on the presence of central nervous system involvement in TTP and the more severe renal involvement in HUS. In HUS 90% of patients are children and a history of prodromal diarrhoeal illness is more common. The therapy of choice for TTP is plasma exchange with fresh frozen plasma."
hematological system,276,"A young boy has a history of epistaxis. CBC normal, except APTT 47s. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hemophilia,ITP,Sickle cell,HUS,Thalassaemia,A,A young boy with epistaxis and prolonged APTT is a probable case of hemophilia. Factor VIII and IX should be offerred to confirm the diagnosis
hematological system,277,A 72 year old male is found on routine bloods to have a white cell count of 32 ,Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia,Viral Infection,Chronic Myeloid Leukaemia,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Acute myeloid leukaemia,A,"CLL is the most likely diagnosis as patients are often asymptomatic at presentation with a lymphocytosis. Normochromic, normocytic anaemia can occur as can pancytopenia secondary to marrow infiltration. Smudge/smear cells are seen on blood film due to damage to lymphocytes during preparation of slides. AML and CML would both lead to a rise in myeloid cells. CLL is differentiated from ALL as the patient would present acutely and are unwell with symptoms secondary to bone marrow failure. There would also be evidence of blast cells on blood film and immunophenotyping can be utilised."
hematological system,278,"A 22-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with severe bleeding around his gum line. He also has extensive bruising affecting his arms and legs, and petechial haemorrhages over his upper body. He has felt increasingly tired over the past month, so much so that now he can barely get out of bed. Examination reveals a BP of 110/80, pulse is 89 and regular, he looks pale and you confirm the extensive bruising. There is splenomegaly on palpation of the abdomen. Bone marrow biopsy and cytogenetics are suggestive of acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APML). Which of the following translocations is most likely to be present?",4:11,11:23,12:21,15:17,9:22,D,"The answer is 15:17. APML is characterised by the 15:17 translocation, which results in formation of the PML/RARa gene on chromosome 15 and a RARa/PML gene on chromosome 17. The PML gene under normal circumstances is thought to play a role in control of apoptosis, and it acts as a transcriptional co-activator with p53, a tumour suppressor gene. The fusion protein which is encoded for by the translocation functions as an aberrant retinoid receptor. This explains why treating with all-trans retinoic acid promotes cell differentiation and is an initial intervention of choice for the condition. APML often presents with clotting abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 4:11, 11:23, 12:21 and 9:22 are all translocations seen in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, (ALL). The 4:11 translocation is associated with a particularly poor prognostic form of ALL, with CNS infiltration at the time of diagnosis. The 9:22 translocation is the Philadelphia chromosome, seen in up to 30-50% of adults with ALL, and is associated with a poorer prognosis versus those who are Philadelphia chromosome negative. It is also commonly seen in cases of CML."
hematological system,279,"A 35 year old female presents with fatigue, aches and pains, night sweats and pruritus. She is also experiencing diarrhoea, shortness of breath and dry cough. Bloods reveal a markedly elevated eosinophil count, thrombocytopenia and elevated ESR. There is no clear evidence to suggest allergies, asthma or parasitic infection and a bone marrow biopsy does not suggest malignancy. How should you manage this patient?",Hydroxyurea,Corticosteroids,Interferon alpha,Imatinib,Nil required,B,The most likely diagnosis is hypereosinophilic syndrome which is characterised by elevated eosinophil count and associated organ damage. All other causes of eosinophilia must be excluded. Organ damage is evidenced here by the dry cough and shortness of breath suggesting pneumonitis and thrombocytopenia. Corticosteroids are utilised as first line management. Hydroxyurea and interferon alpha as second line and Imatinib as third line.
hematological system,280,"A 26 year old female presents to her GP after noticing her urine has been a dark brown colour. She admits to feeling increasingly tired over the last few months and has noticed herself bruising easily. Bloods reveal a low haemoglobin which is macrocytic. She also has low platelets and evidence of increased LDH, low haptoglobin and increased reticulocyte count. A dipstick reveals haematuria however microscopy does not reveal in red blood cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Folate deficiency,Spherocytosis,Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria,Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia,Immune Thrombocytopenic purpura,C,"Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is an acquired genetic disorder which leads to a deficiency of proteins (decay accelerating factor and membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) which protect erythrocytes (and other myeloid cells) from lysis by complement. This increases their susceptibility to complement mediated lysis and thus haemolytic anaemia. If haemolytic anaemia, thrombosis and aplastic anaemia are found in combination then this is pathognomonic of PNH. It can present as above with a haemolytic anaemia, however low platelets and/or white cells can also be seen e.g. in this case where low platelets has led to purpura. Haemaglobinuria occurs secondary to intravascular haemolysis and although it may appear as haematuria there is no evidence on microscopy of red blood cells. Thrombosis can occur such as DVT, Budd Chiari etc. A pancytopenia can also occur. There can be a folate deficiency due to an increase in turn over however folate deficiency on its own would not explain all of the features. ITP is associated with low platelets and none of the other features. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia could explain some of the features however there is no clear precipitant."

hematological system,282,A 14 year old male attends his GP. He has noticed after playing football he appears yellow. He is currently unwell with a cold and has also noticed this yellow discolouration. On examination his sclerae are yellow. There is nil else of note on examination. There is no discolouration of his faeces or urine. Bloods reveal a bilirubin of 50 but other liver function tests are normal. The Hb is 14 g/l. The reticulocyte count is 25. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 2,Hereditary Spherocytosis,Gilbert's Syndrome,Crigler-Najjar Syndrome Type 1,Hereditary Elliptocytosis,C,"Gilbert's syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder. There is mutation in the conjugating enzyme uridine-diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT-1A1) gene leading to a unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. There is intermittent jaundice often following illness, vigorous exercise or lack of sleep. This can be differentiated from haemolytic anaemia as in the case there is a normal reticulocyte count. LDH will be normal and there will be little bilirubin or urobilinogen in the urine. Blood film will be normal. Crigler-Najjar Syndrome is another cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia however it is very rare and is due to an inborn error of metabolism. It is present from birth and very severe and leads to death if untreated."

hematological system,287,Burkitt's lymphoma is associated with a mutation of which of the following genes?,BCL-6 gene,BCR-ABL gene,Cyclin D1 gene,MYC gene,RAR-alpha gene,D,"Burkitt's lymphoma is a monoclonal proliferation of B lymphocytes,which results (approximately 90% of the cases) from chromosome translocations that involve the Myc gene. A chromosome translocation means that a chromosome is broken, which allows it to associate with parts of other chromosomes. The classic chromosome translocation in Burkitt's lymophoma involves chromosome 8, the site of the MYC gene. Burkitt's lymphoma is one of the highest grade malignancies and is a haematological emergency."
hematological system,288,A 75-year-old woman receives two units of packed red cells following a hip replacement. One week later her haemoglobin concentration had fallen by 4 g/L. Which one of the following would be most likely to indicate a delayed transfusion reaction?,Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia,Elevated D dimer concentration,Haemoglobinuria,Haemosiderinuria,Positive direct antiglobulin test,E,The features suggest immune haemolysis with direct antiglobulin test (DAT) being diagnostic. Conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is inappropriate as it is unconjugated bilirubin that is raised in haemolysis. Though useful it would not be diagnostic in this scenario. The remaining incorrect answers are not going to be diagnostic of an immune haemolytic transfusion reaction though may be present.

Laboratory investigations: Hgb 9.2, Hct 27.9%, MCV 132fl, platelet 242, WBC 7.59. Which of the following morphologic findings is most likely to be present on examination of his peripheral blood smear?",Hypersegmented neutrophils,Nucleated RBC,Blasts,"Hypochromic, microcytic RBC",Schistocytes,A,Only anemia with macrocytosis is with normal examination findings makes Megaloblastic aneamia to be most likely cause where PBF shows hypersegmented neutrophils
hematological system,291,"A 60-year-old gentleman is referred to haematology with an elevated calcium level at 2.9 mmol/L, a normochromic normocytic anaemia of 85 g/L, and a serum protein electrophoresis showing a monoclonal paraprotein quantified at 25 g/L. Over the past week, he has also complained of severe back pain in the lumbosacral region radiating to his groin, with numbness of both lower limbs. Which would be the next most appropriate investigation in this case?",Bone marrow examination,Magnetic resonance imaging of the whole spine,PET-CT imaging,Serum free light chains,Skeletal survey,B,"Tests to establish the diagnosis of multiple myeloma include:  bone marrow aspiration and trephine for plasma cell phenotyping immunofixation of serum and urine, and skeletal survey.  Serum free light chain assay is used in oligo- or non-secretory disease. Although PET-CT is developing its own niche in imaging myelomatous deposits, in this case, urgent magnetic resonance imaging to assess bone disease with possible spinal cord compression is the most urgent investigation. "
hematological system,292,Which of the following conditions is most likely to be associated with thrombocytopenia?,Haemophilia A,Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia,Pernicious anaemia,Porphyria,Uraemia,C,Pernicious anaemia is usually a megaloblastic anaemia but may also be associated with a pancytopenia. The platelet count is usually normal in chronic renal failure but there is a platelet function abnormality.
hematological system,293,A 52 year old male is undergoing chemotherapy for leukaemia. He has an indwelling central venous catheter. He becomes unwell and pyrexial and you suspect his line has become infected. What organism is the most likely causative agent?,HACEK group,Klebsiella,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,C,"Staph. Epidermidis and strep. Viridans are the most common cause of infected lines. These are both gram positive organisms. Gram negatives such as Klebsiella, E Coli and pseudomonas are less common causes. Empirical treatment is therefore commenced on the basis of this."
hematological system,294,"A 54-year-old man was electively admitted for hernia repair. Prior to surgery, you detected a serum phosphate level of 0.76 mmol/L (reference range 0.80-1.5 mmol/L). The remainder of his laboratory tests were normal. Which would be the most likely cause?",Hyperventilation during painful venepuncture by a new F1,Laboratory error,Oncogenic hypophosphataemic osteomalacia,Tumour lysis syndrome,X linked hypophosphataemic rickets,A,"The three major mechanisms of hypophosphataemia are:  redistribution of extracellular phosphate into cells decreased intestinal absorption, and depletion due to increased urinary loss.  When a patient hyperventilates, there is a rise in intracellular pH (fall in partial pressure of carbon dioxide, which can readily diffuse across cell membranes). The rise in pH then stimulates phosphofructokinase activity, which in turn activates glycolysis. Oncogenic hypophosphataemic osteomalacia and x linked hypophosphataemic rickets belong to the third mechanism of urinary excretion, but there are no hints to suggest so in the question. Tumour lysis syndrome is incorrect because it causes hyperphosphataemia (and hyperkalaemia) instead of low phosphate level. Laboratory error is possible, but as all other values are normal, this is less likely. The sample should be repeated to confirm the suspicion that this is due to hyperventilation."
hematological system,295,A 40-year-old man presents with bleeding gums and ease of bruising. His only medication is lansoprazole for dyspepsia. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (130-180)   MCV 90 fL (80-96)   Platelets 20 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Prothrombin time 13.5 s (11.5-15.5)    Blood film shows occasional giant platelets. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Drug-induced thrombocytopenia,Immune thrombocytopenic purpura,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,D,"The only abnormality is the very low platelet count. The bone marrow is still working as there are giant platelets seen on film, which you see when there is peripheral consumption of the platelets. The large platelets are a sign that the bone marrow is churning them out prematurely to keep up with demand. With disseminated intravascular coagulation, the prothrombin time would be prolonged. A diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) requires the presence of microangiopathic haemolysis, thrombocytopenia, neurological abnormalities, fever and renal dysfunction. Drug-induced thrombocytopenia occurs due to the induction of antibodies towards platelets. It differs from ITP in that the platelet destruction stops once the drug is withdrawn (c.f. ITP - continues despite drug withdrawal). While lansoprazole can cause a reduction in platelet count, it is not classically a drug you associate with drug-induced thrombocytopenia. Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) results from antibody-mediated destruction of platelets. Most often the stimulus is unknown, but it can be secondary to other autoimmune disorders (e.g. SLE), viral infections (e.g. CMV, VZV, hepatitis C, HIV), Helicobacter pylori, medication and lymphoproliferative disorders. It results in isolated thrombocytopenia, with the most common presenting sign being a purpuric rash."
hematological system,296,A patient with sickle cell anaemia has chronic joint pain. She develops a sudden onset of severe pain in her hands. Which of the following will confirm this is a vasoocclusive crisis rather than her chronic pain and will alter management?,Haemoglobin,None of these options,Reticulocyte count,Haemoglobin electrophoresis,Sickle cell solubility,B,"Although haemoglobin and reticulocyte count may be useful allowing comparison to baseline, there is no definitive laboratory investigation which can confirm this is a definitive vasoocclusive crisis. A metaanalysis suggests that the measurement of these does not alter management. Sickle solubility test, haemoglobin electrophoresis and blood films are useful in confirming the diagnosis."
hematological system,297,A 25-year-old female with a history of type 1 von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is referred for an opinion. She is to have a cervical cone biopsy and the admitting team are concerned about her clotting. You find that she has a past history of menorrhagia and has had two dental extractions as an adolescent that were uncomplicated. Which is the most useful test to assess her bleeding tendency?,Activated partial thromboplastin time,Bleeding time,Plasma factor VIII activity,Platelet aggregation,Prothrombin time,C,"In type I vWD the prothrombin time (PT) and platelet aggregation will be normal. Bleeding time, partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and factor VIII-coagulant (FVIIIc) are likely to be abnormal. The bleeding time would be a good screening test but as we already know she has type I vWBD it will not give a quantitative measurement of her bleeding tendency. Similarly, APTT will not be that useful. The most useful test in practice is to do the vWB antigen and activity (RICOF), but you would also do FVIIIc as this is also low in vWD."
hematological system,298,"A 75-year-old lady is brought to the Emergency Department by her next of kin after a three-week history of having andquot;gone off her feetandquot;. A history of back pain radiating anteriorly around her chest and bilateral weakness of her legs is elicited. Physical examination shows a paraparesis. Blood investigations are notable for haemoglobin of 95 g/L, serum calcium of 3.6 mmol/L and a creatinine of 250 µmol/L. Which of the following would be the most appropriate initial investigation?",Bone marrow biopsy,"Serum protein electrophoresis, quantitative immunoglobulins and serum free light chains","CT chest, abdomen, pelvis",Urgent magnetic resonance imaging of her spine,Urine for creatinine clearance and Bence Jones protein,D,"The combination of hypercalcaemia, anaemia and renal failure in a patient presenting with spinal cord compression should lead you to consider a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. Multiple myeloma is a plasma cell disorder with a malignant clone producing a monoclonal paraprotein. Clinical manifestations relate both to substances secreted by the plasma cells and effects of marrow infiltration. Complications include pathological fractures, hyperviscosity syndrome, hypercalcaemia, renal impairment, bone pain, and recurrent infections. Spinal cord compression can develop due to vertebral compression fractures or vertebral plasmacytomas. An urgent MRI of the spine is indicated to determine whether spinal cord compression is present in view of this pa neurology. Bone marrow biopsy, serum protein electrophoresis, quantitative immunoglobulins and serum free light chains and urine for creatinine clearance and Bence Jones protein should all be done following this to determine if myeloma is the underlying diagnosis, and to help guide further treatment. CT can be used to lineate the extent of disease but is not a first line investigation for myeloma or spinal cord compression. It is also important to realise that this level of hypercalcaemia is potentially life-threatening, with risk of arrhythmia or coma. Immediate treatment is with intravenous hydration (rapidly) followed by intravenous bisphosphonate."
hematological system,299,"A 72-year-old man presents with a five-day history of cough, dyspnoea and fever. His chest x ray shows a left basal consolidation. His full blood count shows:    Haemoglobin 110 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 30 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 10 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Lymphocytes 20 ×10^9/L (1.5-4)   Monocytes 1 ×10^9/L (0-0.8)   Eosinophils 0.4 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   Basophils 0.1 ×10^9/L (0-0.1)    Which one of the following is the most appropriate test to establish the diagnosis?",Bone marrow aspirate,Bone marrow cytogenetics,CT abdomen,Immunophenotyping of white cells,Sputum cytology and AFB,D,"Apart from the mild neutrophilia, which could be explained by the infection, the significant abnormality on the FBC is the lymphocyte count. Such a high lymphocyte count could be suggestive of a lymphoproliferative disorder such as chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. The best way to diagnose these is immunophenotyping of the blood: non-invasive and will give a diagnosis based on the cell surface markers expressed and can identify malignant cell populations, often referred to as clonal. The patient may have lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly which would show on CT but no diagnosis can be made from this. A bone marrow is invasive and the BM is sometimes not involved in low-grade lymphoproliferative disorders and, similarly, there may be no cytogenetic abnormality. The FBC is not suggestive of TB or malignancy, therefore sputum examination would not be useful."
hematological system,300,Which of the following statements concerning iron metabolism is correct?,Approximately 0.1% of body iron circulates in the plasma,Approximately 90% of dietary iron is absorbed in the intestine,The main route of excretion is the liver,The serum ferritin concentration is reduced characteristically following surgery,The transferrin content of intestinal mucosal cells is high when body iron stores are high,A,"Approximately 4 mg of iron circulate within the plasma with a total body iron store of 3-4 g (2500 mg in the RBCs, 500 mg in liver, 500 mg in macrophages, and about 500 mg in muscle). From an intake of approximately 6 mg/1000 kcal of dietary iron, only 15% is bioavailable. The majority of iron contained within the RBCs is metabolised and re-utilised but 1 mg per day is lost through the gut. Ferritin, the plasma protein responsible for binding iron, is an acute phase reactant protein and increases in inflammatory conditions following surgery. Transferrin is a glycoprotein responsible for internal iron exchange and the content within mucosal cells is naturally low in haemochromatosis with high saturation."
hematological system,301,A patient is brought to A and E very unwell from what is a suspected meningococcal septicaemia. He begins to bleed from his venflon site and nose. You notice purpura and petechiae on his limbs. Blood tests reveal a prolonged PT and APTT and a low fibrinogen level. Platelets are sightly low. How would you manage this patients bleeding?,Platelet transfusion,Fresh frozen plasma transfusion,Blood transfusion,Nil required,Low molecular weight heparin,B,The likely diagnosis here is disseminated intravascular coagulation as evidenced by the blood results and history of meningococcal septicaemia. FFP plays an important role as do platelets although in this case platelets were only slightly reduced. Transfusion of blood may be required if the haemoglobin falls. Activated protein C has been shown to be useful in the management of DIC caused by sepsis.
hematological system,302,"A 42-year-old man presents with increasing abdominal pain and a feeling of fullness and nausea when he eats. He has also felt constitutionally unwell over the past few weeks and months with some night sweats and gradual weight loss. On examination his BMI is 21, his BP is 126/82 mmHg, pulse 80 and regular, his temperature is 37.4°C. He has an abdominal fullness with some evidence of ascites.

What this does is to juxtapose c-Myc, which is a transcription factor responsible for initiating the cell cycle, with the locus for the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Burkitt's lymphoma, particularly sporadic lymphoma, may be seen in adults and commonly involves the abdominal organs, usually the caecum as seen here, or the distal ileum. Localised Burkitt's is associated with around a 90% survival rate, although the prognosis is less good in adults. 2:5 translocation is commonly seen in anaplastic large cell lymphoma 8:21 translocation is commonly seen in Acute myeloid leukaemia 9:22 is commonly seen in chronic myeloid leukaemia known as the Philadelphia chromsome. 11:14 is commonly seen in Multiple Myeloma."
hematological system,303,"A 50-year-old man is admitted to the hospital with a third attack of renal stones in the last six months. He suffers from Crohn's disease and has previously had a limited small bowel resection, but his disease is now quiescent. Apparently, there is a history of high calcium levels in other blood relatives. On examination, his BP is 115/72 mmHg, his BMI is 19.5, he has a midline scar consistent with a previous laparotomy. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 6.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 272 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 85 µmol/L (79-118)   Calcium 2.89 mmol/L (2.20-2.67)   PTH Upper limit of normal range    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia,Primary hyperparathyroidism,PTHrP levels increased due to underlying malignancy,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Tertiary hyperparathyroidism,A,"Plasma calcium is tightly regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH) and vitamin D, which act on the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and bone. PTH releases calcium from bone and inhibits its excretion from the kidney. Vitamin D promotes calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. Plasma calcium levels are detected by a calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid glands. This gentleman has a raised calcium with an inappropriately high PTH. The remainder of his bloods are normal, with no evidence of renal failure or malabsorption. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia is an autosomal dominant condition and is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The disease most often leads to asymptomatic elevated levels of serum calcium, although some patients with the condition may suffer recurrent episodes of renal stones. The inherited condition is usually caused by a mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene.The perceived lack of calcium levels by the parathyroid leads to resetting of calcium and PTH to higher levels. It does not require any treatment. Primary hyperparathyroidism is caused by parathyroid adenomas or hyperplasia, which results in raised PTH and subsequently raised plasma and urinary calcium. Alkaline phosphatase is raised, and serum phosphate is reduced. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is compensatory hypertrophy of all four glands due to hypocalcaemia (due to chronic kidney disease, or malabsorption). PTH is raised and calcium is low or normal. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism develops after a prolonged period of secondary hyperparathyroidism. The parathyroid glands become autonomous and both PTH and calcium are raised. PTH-related protein is responsible for 80% of hypercalcaemia in malignancy and acts on the same receptors as PTH. It is secreted by squamous cell tumours, breast and renal tumours. Serum calcium is raised, but PTH will be low. "

hematological system,306,A 68-year-old male has recently undergone surgery for a tumour in his sigmoid colon. Pre-operative investigations did not reveal any distant metastases. The pathology results confirm positive regional lymph nodes with tumour in the apical node. What stage cancer does the patient have according to Dukes' staging system?,A,B,C1,C2,D,D,"The Dukes' staging system has been proven to correlate well with a patient's chance of survival; a Dukes' C colon cancer has a 40-50% chance of cure at five years. The Dukes' staging system has now largely been replaced with the TNM system, however it is still used and referred to in follow-up of patients diagnosed and treated recently. It is classified as follows:  Dukes' A - lesions confined to the bowel wall Dukes' B - lesions reach the serosa Dukes' C1 - local nodes involved but apical nodes are spared Dukes' C2 - local nodes and apical nodes involved Dukes' D - widespread metastases.  This patient has Dukes' C2 staging. The greater the number of lymph nodes the worse the five year survival."

hematological system,309,"A 12 year old girl presents with profuse diarrhoea. It was initially watery and then became bloody. She was unwell with fever, abdominal pain, petechial rash and vomiting. Bloods reveal a low haemoglobin with elevated reticulocytes, LDH and bilirubin, low platelets and acute renal failure. Coombs test is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Gastroenteritis,Ulcerative Colitis,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Acute leukaemia,A,"The most likely diagnosis is haemolytic uraemic syndrome with the triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (Coombs negative), thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. It commonly follows infection with E Coli 0157:H7 and therefore bloody diarrhoea. It presents as above with petechia or purpura. Ulcerative colitis would not explain the haemolytic anaemia nor would gastroenteritis. The bloods are not in keeping with acute leukaemia nor is the bloody diarrhoea. TTP is similar however there is often neurological abnormalities and schistocytes on blood film and there is more severe organ damage"

It typically leads to fever, generalised erythroderma, hepatitis and diarrhoea. It is due to the presence of immunologically competent graft cells mounting an attack against host cells and cytokines are involved. Non myeloablative allogeneic stem cell transplant is utilised as there is a reduced risk of graft versus host disease. Antibiotics, antivirals and antifungals are given in GVHD as pancytopenia occurs to try to reduced opportunistic infection."

hematological system,315,Which one of the following is true of IgE?,Crosses the normal placenta,Is increased acutely in an asthmatic attack,Is increased in the serum of atopic individuals,Is involved in type 2 hypersensitivity,Is present in plasma in the same concentration as IgG,C,"IgG is the predominant form of immunoglobulin in plasma at a concentration around 10,000 times that of IgE. IgG crosses the placenta to confer immunity to the fetus but IgE does not. IgE is involved in arming mast cells and basophils. IgE causes mast cells to release vasoactive amines, such as histamine, producing an inflammatory response which can result in a type I hypersensitivity reaction. IgE is responsible for allergen-mediated diseases such as anaphylaxis, asthma, and atopy. Total serum IgE is frequently increased in those with atopy but serum IgE does not rise acutely during an asthmatic attack."
hematological system,316,"A 14-year-old girl is referred to haematology after being investigated for heavy menstrual bleeding and recurrent epistaxis by her gynaecologist. Clotting tests show a normal PT, but mildly prolonged aPTT. Further tests ordered by the haematologist show decreased levels of factor VIII and von Willebrand factor. She is diagnosed with type 1 von Willebrand disease. Her mother has the same pathology and her two other sisters are unaffected. What is the method of inheritance of this common clotting disorder?",Acquired,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal dominant with variable penetrance,Autosomal recessive,De novo acquisition,C,"von Willebrand disease (VWD) is divided into three major categories:  Type I - partial quantitative deficiency Type II - qualitative deficiency Type III - total deficiency.  VWD type II is further divided into four variants (IIA, IIB, IIN, IIM) based on characteristics of dysfunctional vWF. These categories correspond to distinct molecular mechanisms, with corresponding clinical features and therapeutic recommendations. Type I vWD is the most common form of the disease and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, with variable penetrance being commonly observed. Von Willebrand disease is estimated to affect 1 in 100 to 10,000 individuals. Because people with mild signs and symptoms do not usually come to medical attention, it is thought that this condition is underdiagnosed, also taking into consideration the variable penetrance of the inheritance mechanism. The inheritance pattern of type II is autosomal dominant, whereas in type III it is autosomal recessive. "

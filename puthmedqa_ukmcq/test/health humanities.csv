health humanities,1,"A 35 year old pregnant woman attends the antenatal clinic at 34 weeks of gestation to discuss VBAC. Her 10 year old son accompanies her. You notice that she has failed to attend two previous appointments. It quickly becomes apparent that the woman speaks very little English, however, her son is a fluent English speaker. Her mother in law is in the waiting room and speaks good English too. What is the most appropriate way to continue this consultation?",Use very simple words so the woman understands,Ask the woman's mother in law to interpret,Use the woman's son to interpret,Reschedule the appointment and book a professional interpreter,Obtain a professional interpreter for this consultation (e.g. telephone service),E,"Obtain a professional interpreter for this consultation (e.g. telephone service)One of the top ten recommendations from the eighth CMACE report is that: ""professional interpretation services should be provided for all pregnant women who do not speak English"". Using the woman's mother in law to interpret could mean that the woman doesn't feel comfortable talking about intimate concerns. It is also unclear to you how much of what is discussed is being correctly translated. The mother in law may not understand the medical details, or may deliberately withhold information. It is inappropriate to expect a child to translate intimate details about his mother. In this case, rebooking the appointment is not the best option as there is a history of missed appointments."
health humanities,2,You decide to do a study looking at proportions of women taking pre-conceptual folic acid in each of 5 socioeconomic groups. Once the data is collated which statistical test would be most appropriate to analyse the data?,ANOVA,Wilcoxan Rank Sum,Students t-Test,Mann Whitney U,Chi Squared,E,"This involves categorical data and would be appropriate to analyse using a chi squared test.Statistical Tests Student's t-TestTests a hypothesis on the basis of a difference between sample means i.e. the t test determines a probability that two populations are the same with respect to the variable tested. An example null hypothesis might be there is no difference in the mean BMI of patients undergoing vaginal and caesarian section deliveries.Chi SquaredNonparametric test used to compare numerical or categorical data sets. For example you might want to investigate the proportion of women taking pre conceptual folic acid in different socioeconomic groups.ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)ANOVA is a method for testing the hypothesis that there is no difference between two or more population means (usually at least three). ANOVA is used to test for differences among several means without increasing the Type I error rate which can occur if comparing multiple means by conducting multiple t-tests.Rank Sum TestsWilcoxan and Mann Whitney U tests are both rank sum tests. These are Nonparametric tests of the null hypothesis that two samples come from the same population against an alternative hypothesis, especially that a particular population tends to have larger values than the other. Unlike the t-test it does not require the assumption of normal distributions. It is nearly as efficient as the t-test on normal distributions"
health humanities,3,The role of mentoring can be taken on by different people in different circumstances. Who can take on the role of a mentor?,It is only appropriate for mentoring to be performed by senior consultants.,Mentors must all be trained as educational supervisors.,Anyone who is trained to perform appraisals can be a mentor as the process is very similar.,"Mentors direct the mentee to think through issues in very specific, directive ways.","A mentor could be a manager, consultant, educational supervisor or junior trainee, it is important that they display special attributes and skills.",E,Mentors have special attributes and skills. They usually offer guidance and support through non directive exploration of training issues and personal dilemmas. Mentoring is distinctly different
health humanities,4,Which of the following statements is true with regards to summative assessments?,The purpose of a summative assessment is to establish whether a trainee is competent to perform a procedure,"Unlike formative OSATS forms, summative OSATS require a judgement relating to the competence of the trainee",The primary purpose of a summative assessment is to judge a trainee as 'able to perform competently' or 'working towards competence',The RCOG suggests that any registrar or consultant can act as assessors in WPBA encounters,Either a summative or a formative OSATS form can be used to document a judgement on a trainee's competence,B,Summative OSATS allow a trainee to demonstrate their competence in a procedure and progress in their training. Formative OSATS give a trainee the opportunity to practise and get feedback for a given procedure.
health humanities,5,"A 22-year-old female is admitted following severe injuries sustained in a road traffic accident. She is communicative but in shock with low blood pressure and tachycardia. You realise that without a transfusion she will die but she informs you that she has recently become a Jehovah's Witness and that she adamantly refuses transfusion despite knowledge that she could die. She is able to understand this and communicate her decision back to you. Her distraught parents tell you that she has only recently joined the Jehovah's Witnesses and implore you to transfuse her, as they insist that she does not know her own mind. Together with other intervention which she permits, what is the most appropriate action regarding possible transfusion?",Declare her incompetent and transfuse,Do not transfuse even if it means that she will die,Get immediate psychiatric intervention to section her and then transfuse,"Transfuse immediately, irrespective of the patient's wishes",Wait until she becomes unconscious and then get consent from her parents to transfuse,B,"The patient appears competent and has elected to refuse the transfusion. Despite the parents' protestation, you must respect the patient's wishes if, as seems likely here, she is making a reasoned judgement. If the patient refuses the transfusion then even if she slips into unconsciousness you are not permitted to treat with transfusion, even if it is in her best interests."
health humanities,6,"A 65-year-old man with castrate-resistant prostate cancer is seen in clinic with an increasingly painful right hip. This is worse on weight bearing and can also wake him from sleep should he roll onto his right side. His PSA was 27.2 ng/ml when he was last seen in clinic six months ago, the latest reading is 650.1 ng/ml. Prior to consulting you he sought the opinion of his GP who recently increased his long acting morphine preparation from 30 mg BD to 50 mg BD with little effect on his pain control. Which would be the best initial management option?",Increase long acting morphine to 70 mg BD,MRI scan of right hip and pelvis,Palliative radiotherapy to right hip,Plain x ray of right hip and pelvis,Prescribe naproxen 250 mg BD,D,"This patient has had a rapid rise in his PSA and is already castrate resistant; although the question does not specifically state he has known bone metastases it would be expected that you would have already picked up on the red flag symptoms and understood that a very common site of metastasis from prostate cancer is to the bones. In this case the increasing pain especially on weight bearing and waking him at night are significant red flag symptoms pointing to an enlarging metastasis in his right hip. There is a good chance that left uninvestigated this will lead to a pathological fracture in the next month. Increasing his morphine may help but his pain is not very responsive to opiates. Adding an NSAID is a good idea in bone pain providing there are no other contraindications. Amitriptyline tends to work best for neuropathic pain but as it is sedating it may help him sleep better. Palliative radiotherapy is an excellent option for pain resistant to analgesics but will do little to reduce his fracture risk. A plain x ray is a good starting point for investigating this pain, however if it is negative then consideration should be given to an MRI pelvis/hip as even large metastases can be missed on x ray. The x ray can be used to calculate Mirels' score - given that the likely site of the metastasis is peritrochanteric and the pain is functional this gives at least a score of 8 indicating that it is important to liaise with orthopaedics regarding prophylactic pinning of his hip to reduce the risk of fracture. Mirels' criteria (score greater than8 suggests prophylactic fixation):    Score 1 2 3   Site Upper Limb Lower Limb Peritrochanteric   Pain Mild Moderate Functional   Lesion Blastic Mixed Lytic   Size less than1/3 1/3 to 2/3 greater than2/3"
health humanities,7,Which one of the following is true of clinical audit?,Clinical audit is a quality improvement process and is best performed through the means of a randomised control trial,Clinical audit projects are best constructed and ran by junior doctors,Clinical audit requires a number of stages known as the 'audit cycle',Clinical governance is the autonomy which individual clinicians have to decide the best treatment for a patient,Only hospital clinicians should be involved in clinical audit,C,"Clinical audit is a quality improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcome through systemic review of care against explicit criteria and the implementation of change. Clinical audit projects are best conducted within a structured programme, with effective leadership, participation by all staff, and an emphasis on team working and support. Adequate funding should also be put aside to run these projects properly. Within the audit cycle there are stages which follow a systemic process of establishing best practice, measuring care against criteria, taking action to improve care, and monitoring to sustain improvement. Clinical governance is framework through which the NHS is accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which excellence in clinical care will flourish. The General Medical Council now advises all doctors 'must take part in regular and systematic medical and clinical audit'."
health humanities,8,"During the appraisal process , Which of the following is correct ?",The appraiser should never use a ‘closed questioning style’ with the appraisee,The appraiser should try to quickly confirm the key areas for the appraisee’s improvement at the start of the appraisal,The appraiser should use a combination of ‘open and closed questioning styles’,The appraiser is allowed to be discouraging/demotivating if there is evidence the appraisee’s actions have compromised patient safety,The appraiser can only use an ‘open questioning style’ with the appraisee,C,"A skilful appraiser will often start with an ‘open questioning style’ to encourage the appraisee to respond, but will need to later confirm/clarify information or obtain commitment from the appraisee, through ‘closed questions’. The appraisal should be a positive, clinical and educational developmental process it should not be seen as a means for delivering punitive measures."
health humanities,9,Which of the following statements is true with regards to workplace based assessments?,They are sufficiently reliable to stand alone as an assessment tool and do not need to be used together with endpoint high stakes ‘know how’ and ‘show how’ assessments of learning,"They are opportunistic, not needs driven, unless there is a proper understanding between the trainer and trainee",Weaker trainees will more likely seek feedback and therefore it is essential that WPBAs are done regularly and repeatedly,"They are mainly learner led but can also be trainer driven, depending on the circumstances",None of the above,D,"Although in principle WPBA are learner led (with the trainee identifying areas for observations and feedback), it is also important to appreciate that they can also be trainer driven."

health humanities,14,A 23-year-old female attends clinic for a routine appointment regarding a six month history of occasional fits. She has seen the neurologists who have diagnosed idiopathic epilepsy and have prescribed lamotrigine. She informs you that she is doing well with this medication and has not had a fit for two months. She has been told that she must stop driving but you have seen that she drove to attend the clinic. You discuss this with her and insist that she stops driving to which she informs you that she had stopped driving but since she is fit free she must continue to drive because of her employment. Which of the following is the most appropriate action to take in these circumstances?,Inform patient that you will notify the DVLA,Inform patient that you will notify the police,Inform the epilepsy clinic that she is still driving and allow them to deal with this issue,You cannot inform any external body due to patient confidentiality,Your only action is to write in the notes that the patient has been repeatedly warned but chose to ignore advice as she presents no serious risk in view of her epilepsy control,A,The law is quite clear on such issues regarding epilepsy and the ability to drive. If the diagnosis is confirmed the patient must stop driving and inform the DVLA regarding the diagnosis. If the patient continues to drive despite advice to the contrary then the doctor has a duty of care to society overriding confidentiality to the patient and may inform the DVLA.

She has been treated according to the WHO analgesic ladder and is currently taking morphine modified release. However despite increasing doses, her pain is not well controlled. She has also tried amitriptyline which has not helped. You ask the local palliative medicine consultant for advice and she suggests starting gabapentin. Which of the following most appropriately describes the recognised primary pathway on which gabapentin is thought to work for its role in the management of neuropathic pain.",Activation of GABA inhibitory system,Enhanced descending inhibition,Potentiation of glutamate excitatory system,Sodium channel blockade,Inhibition of GABA inhibitory system,A,"Gabapentin is a commonly used adjunctive agent for neuropathic pain. Its mechanism of action is not fully understood. Some authors suggest it works by inhibition of glutamate excitatory neurones, whereas others suggest it potentiates GABA. If asked to commit for the purpose of the MRCP examination, potentiation of GABA tends to be the accepted mechanism. Four to six weeks of treatment are often needed before the patient experiences benefit. Sodium channel blockers, such as lacosamide, are emerging as treatments for neuropathic pain. Serotonin-noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors, such as venlafaxine, can enhance descending inhibition in the spinal cord."

She was noted to have a large baby at her 36-week scan and was induced at 38 weeks of gestation.Although she expressed concerns about the size of the baby, the risk of shoulder dystocia (9-10% in diabetic mothers) was never discussed with her. Her consultant, who advised a vaginal delivery, defended her practice saying that in her estimation, ‘the risk of a grave problem for the baby arising as a result of shoulder dystocia was very small (0.1%7)"".The baby was delivered by forceps, but this was complicated by shoulder dystocia and there was a delay of 12 minutes between the delivery of the fetal head and body. Her son developed severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy as a result of hypoxia during delivery.The law now requires a doctor to take reasonable care to ensure that the patient is aware of any material risks involved in any recommended treatment, and of any reasonable alternative or variant treatments’ TheUK Supreme Court talks of a 'dialogue’ between doctor and patient.So doctors must now ask themselves three questions:1. Does the patient know about the material risks of the treatment |am proposing?2. Does the patient know about reasonable alternatives to thistreatment?3. Have i taken reasonable care to ensure that the patient actuallyknows this?A material risk is a risk to which a reasonable person in the patient’s position would be likely to attach significance or a risk that a doctor knows —or should reasonably know- would probably be deemed of significance by this particular patient."

The ultimate responsibility is yours and you have to inform the DVLA. Of course, it would be important to inform the patient's next of kin first to try to get the patient to stop driving voluntarily. On the DVLA website there is a document on medical reasons for being unfit to drive and when patients can start driving again after a medical event. This include the size of aortic aneurysms as well as obvious reasons such as epilepsy. "

For a patient to be said to have capacity to make a particular decision, the patient should understand the information they are given about the decision at hand and be able to retain the information long enough to weigh it in the balance and come to a decision for themselves. The assessment of capacity to make a decision does not necessarily have to be made by a psychiatrist or psychogeriatrician although, where there are any doubts about the capacity of a person who is making an important decision, it may be helpful to seek a specialist view. Many patients make decisions that appear to doctors to be irrational, but this in itself is not an indication of lack of capacity. Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, an individual will be able to appoint a person to act as their attorney (Lasting Power of Attorney, LPA) if and when the individual becomes mentally incapacitated in the future. LPAs will be able to make some decisions about health and welfare on behalf of the patient, but only when the patient has lost the capacity to make those decisions for him or herself.

Following various investigations he was diagnosed with local and distant metastases. Despite this he has remained relatively well and is able to live independently. He has not opened his bowels for three days and has been feeling generally tired. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?,"Blood tests, including bone profile",IV fluids,Laxatives orally,Refer to surgeons,Stop opioid,A,"Hypercalcaemia is a common problem in palliative care. It is more common in certain cancers and prostate cancer with bone metastasis (as suggested in this scenario) is a frequent cause.

Specifically you wish to compare postoperative infection rates and also whether there are any differences between the clinical diagnosis and the histological diagnosis between the differing grades of practitioner performing the procedure. Which of the following statements are correct concerning this study?,Approval for the study must be obtained from the local ethics committee,If a study has already published with exactly the same concept then this constitutes plagiarism,If such a study has already been published then the investigators must obtain consent from the original authors to replicate their work,The study is flawed in its design and should not be performed,This is an audit and does not require ethical committee approval,A,"This is not an audit. There is no information provided to indicate that there are either any local or national guidelines relating to such a study. Furthermore, there is no information provided to indicate that there is a specific clinical problem to which an audit should be addressed. Consequently, this is a research study and is a retrospective study. As such, it requires local ethical committee approval. The study itself seems very reasonable and even if it were published elsewhere it would still be reasonable to perform in the investigator's practice as the outcomes may be completely different. Using the same methods as another study is perfectly justifiable, if only to prove the veracity of the original publication. No consent is required from the original authors if a similar study has already been published."

How are they likely to be recruiting their participants?,There is a comprehensive survey of a topic where all relevant studies of the highest level of evidence are identified and data from these studies are then combined in a systematic and objective way,Participants are recruited and are then randomly allocated to an experimental group receiving the new treatment or a control group receiving no treatment,Participants suspected to have the target condition are asked to undergo both a new diagnostic test and the existing gold standard test,There is an exposed and non exposed group of participants who are then followed up over time,Patients who already have a certain condition are compared with people who do not,B,The other options describe different types of studies e.g.:There is an exposed and non exposed group of participants who are then followed up over time – this is a cohort study.Participants suspected to have the target condition are asked to undergo both a new diagnostic test and the existing gold standard test – this is a randomised controlled trial.Patients who already have a certain condition are compared with people who do not – this is a case control study.There is a comprehensive survey of a topic where all relevant studies of the highest level of evidence are identified and data from these studies are then combined in a systematic and objective way – this is a systematic review.
health humanities,35,"To allow the trainee to practice evidence based medicine, what would be the most appropriate source of information that will help the trainee make a management decision?",Randomised control trial,Meta analysis,Textbook,Guideline,Systematic review,D,"In a clinical scenario, up to date guidelines are the most appropriate source of information to help aid decision making.This is because guidelines are created after review of a number of sources of information, clinical trials and reviews, whilst keeping in mind local needs and resource availability. A single trial/systematic review/meta analysis is insufficient to make clinical decisions as the research question asked may not be appropriate for the population at hand."

This may prevent a more serious complaint. It may be appropriate to explain why you were delayed in your apology i.e. ""I'm sorry you have had such a long wait, I was delayed as I was dealing with an emergency.…"" but remember that confidentiality will prevent you from providing any further details regarding the care of other patients. Telling the woman that she would have been seen more quickly if she had attended earlier in the day may not be true, and could lead to a delayed presentation or additional complaints in the future."

Some see mentoring as informal discussions to generate support but others identify it as a more structured process and a guide to decision making. Mentoring is appropriate at all stages in the career of a doctor.
health humanities,39,"A Pregnant woman at 9 weeks she has quadruple pregnancy, she asked for selective reduction of pregnancy. Under which clause of abortion can she be categorized ?",Clause A,Clause B,Clause C,Clause E,Clause F,D,"It was made clear that selective termination (ST) is also covered by the same legislation. In multiple pregnancies, ST is legal under ground E when one fetus is affected by an abnormality that carries significant risk of postnatal disability or in higher-order multiple pregnancy (such as quadruplet and above) because of the consequent risk of preterm-birth related disability. In normal twin and triplet pregnancies, the magnitude of risk is smaller and ST is usually justified under ground C (when the pregnancy is under 24 weeks and continuing would involve greater risk of injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman than if the pregnancy were terminated)."
health humanities,40,A trainee was recently involved in the management of a case of massive postpartum haemorrhage. As the trainee's educational supervisor you would like to assess the skills of the trainee with respect to management of postpartum haemorrhages. Which workplace based assessment tool is ideal for use in this situation?,Structured OSAT station,Mini CEX,Case based discussion,Team observation/feedback,Essay on the topic,C,"As there was a recent event which can be reflected on, a case based discussion is the ideal wokplace based assessment that can be used for assessing the skills of the trainee with regards to the management of postpartum haemorrhage in general. The various management options can be discussed alongside allowing the assessor to discuss similar hypothetical situations. An OSAT may miss the potential to discuss around the topic in detail and not feasible as a WPBA.Team observation will not provide adequate insight into the trainee's skills in that particular area and an essay will not provide an opportunity to discuss uncovered topics around the interested subject."

health humanities,45,"You are asked to see a 78-year-old man who has been admitted to the ward for terminal care following a massive subarachnoid haemorrhage. He is unconscious but the nurses are concerned that he has pooling of secretions, tries to cough and becomes distressed. On examination he is unconscious, but has a respiratory rate of 30 and has a death rattle. He is receiving diamorphine via a syringe driver. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for him?",Atropine nebulisers,Hyoscine butylbromide administered subcutaneously,Increase the dose of diamorphine via the syringe driver,Salbutamol nebulisers,Saline nebulisers,B,"The answer is hyoscine butylbromide s/c which can be given up to three times per day in boluses of 10-20 mg. Both hyoscine and atropine when given subcutaneously are thought to be equally appropriate for drying up secretions. Whilst both atropine and salbutamol given in nebulised form are bronchodilators, they are unlikely to be effective in relieving his symptoms. Saline nebulisers are only likely to irritate him further and cause worsening coughing. Increasing his diamorphine may be associated with significant risk of hastening a respiratory arrest."
health humanities,46,A 78-year-old male dies and is found by his children the following morning (after having seen him alive the night before). His GP attends to certify him dead. The patient had a known history of ischaemic heart disease and was treated in the local hospital where angiography performed nine months previously for angina had revealed some insignificant coronary artery disease of two vessels for which medical therapy was deemed most appropriate. He had also been diagnosed eight years previously with diabetes mellitus for which he took metformin and gliclazide. He had seen the practice nurse two weeks ago for review of his diabetes.

In this case the patient had been seen six weeks previously by the partner. Consequently, and in view of the sudden death, the coroner should be informed. He may decide that in the circumstances reported, the doctor may be able to issue a death certificate stating ischaemic heart disease if he deems it appropriate, and on the balance of advice given to him."

Which of the following apply with regard to obtaining consent for the procedure?,"If the mini mental score is above 20/30, consent can be taken from patient",Psychogeriatric opinion is needed before consent can be obtained,Relatives/next of kin will have to consent for the patient,The doctor will be able to consent for the patient,The procedure does not require a written consent,E,"In this case, which is an emergency, informed written consent is not essential as the procedure is potentially life-saving and the doctor would be seen to be acting in the patient's best interest. The process of consent for a procedure relies upon written and informed consent which the patient has to understand. When a patient has impaired mental capacity, the doctor may be uncertain whether the patient is competent to give informed consent. Under English law no other person can consent to treatment on behalf of an adult, though it is desirable that next of kin are consulted before treating an adult without consent. Recent legislation gives legal authority to people appointed by the patient, or by the state, or a relative or carer, to consent (or refuse) on behalf of the patient. A mini-mental score may not adequately identify those unable to give consent. "

health humanities,50,"An elderly woman with a background of multiple myeloma has been started on opioid analgesia for low back pain. Since starting opioids she has had problems with nausea and has been tried on two different agents. Her GP started a third antiemetic two weeks ago. Her husband has noticed she seems restless and cannot keep still. He has become increasingly concerned in the last few days as she has been unable to keep up with him on their walks and has generally 'slowed down'. From the list of drugs, on which has the patient most likely been started?",Cyclizine,Domperidone,Haloperidol,Levomepromazine,Ondansetron,C,"This scenario describes a patient developing drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP). This can occur when drugs with dopamine receptor antagonist (D2) activity are initiated as antiemetics. Commonly used drugs which fall into this category include haloperidol, domperidone and metoclopramide. Akathisia and bradykinesia are more common in drug induced parkinsonism. Of the drugs listed here, haloperidol and domperidone have significant D2 receptor activity. Haloperidol has much greater affinity for central D2 receptors as domperidone less readily crosses the blood brain barrier. Haloperidol is therefore much more likely to cause DIP."

Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Left ventricular failure,Panic attack,Pericardial effusion,Pleural effusion,Pneumothorax,C,"Diagnosing pericardial effusions early is essential and should always be considered as a differential for breathlessness, especially in patients with mediastinal disease. This is likely due to superior vena caval obstruction. A strong clinical clue is breathlessness with raised venous pressure but normal chest examination. Left ventricular failure, pleural effusion and pneumothorax would be likely to result in an abnormal chest examination. A panic attack would not cause these examination findings (unless panic occurred on top of another condition)."

This is not an ideal situation but it could arise. The discussion may be very basic and unstructured at first. However, it soon becomes obvious that the knowledge base of the learners is high and the discussion is allowed to snowball increase in intensity and importance. One example would be the task of teaching ethics to a group of 12 embryologists tor 2 hours. The teacher is unsure of their current understanding of the subject. They may start by getting the students in groups, to discuss the terms of the Abortion Act 1967, basing further teaching on the knowledge displayed by the students. Some clinical teaching methods have been employed by teachers throughout their clinical lifetime without their being aware that they had a formal name!"

health humanities,76,Which of the following situations highlight the need for new methods of determining death in the face of continued cardiorespiratory function?,Brain surgery,Locked-in syndrome,Ondine's curse,Open heart surgery,Organ transplantation,E,"The conventional criteria previously established for clinical death were based upon lack of cardiorespiratory function. The development of organ transplantation highlighted patients who had conditions incompatible with life but who continued to have some form of cardiorespiratory function with artificial support. This led to a code of practice for the diagnosis of brainstem death. This is based on the knowledge that when the brainstem is damaged to such a degree that its functions are irreversibly destroyed, the heart will inevitably stop beating shortly afterwards. When this occurs, therefore, the patient is dead even though respiration and circulation can be artificially maintained. Brain stem function is checked through set criteria, and the findings must be agreed by at least two senior doctors. This scenario commonly occurs in ICU when the need for determining death is not achievable by the regular measures due to life support machines such as ventilators.  Life support should be withdrawn at this point, but consideration should be taken as to whether the person would be a suitable organ donor. "

health humanities,79,Pregnant patient newly discovered HIV positive doesn't want you to inform her husband?,Do not inform,Inform GP,Inform her husbhand,Inform social services,Encourage her to tell him,E,"The psyco-sexual care of women newly diagnosed with HIV during pregnancyConfidence in telling others about an HIV diagnosis will vary from woman to woman, and there may be cultural factors that influence the patterns of telling partners and other social network members . Talking about HIV should be encouraged in all women but should be viewed as a process that may take some time .Talking about HIV to a family member, other than a sexual partner, should be encouraged as this has been demonstrated to reduce levels of postnatal depression . There are situations in which a woman given a new diagnosis of HIV may be reluctant to share this with a current sexual partner, or appears to want to delay telling indefinitely. This can give rise to complex professional, ethical, moral and, potentially, legal situations. There is a conflict between the duty of confidentiality to the index patient and a duty to prevent harm to others. Breaking confidentiality in order to inform a sexual partner of the index patient’s positive HIV status is sanctioned as a ‘last resort’ by the World Health Organization (WHO) and GMC . However, it is not to be taken lightly as it could have the negative impact of deterring others from testing because of the fear of forced imparting of HIV status and loss of trust by patients in the confidential doctor—patient relationship. Cases with challenging issues around sharing of HIV status should be managed by the MDT. It is important to accurately record discussions and management strategy in these cases. Timely partner testing during the pregnancy should be encouraged where possible and support givenHIV testing of existing children should be raised with all women. In practice, if the children are asymptomatic the testing is often most easily done when the newborn is attending paediatric follow-up for HIV diagnostic tests"

You advise her the odds ratio of developing cervical cancer in smokers is 6. She asks what you mean by odds ratio. Which of the below best describes odds ratio?,The difference between an exposed group's disease rate and a control/unexposed groups disease rate.,The probability or risk of developing a disease,"Relative measure of effect, comparing the exposure group of a study relative to the control group.",Probability or risk of disease in exposed group divided by probability of disease in unexposed group,The difference in rate of a condition between an exposed population and an unexposed population,C,"Relative risk is the probability of disease in exposed group divided by probability of disease in unexposed group. It is sometimes called the risk ratio. For example if 10% of smokers develop a type of cancer and only 2% of non smokers develop that cancer the relative risk of developing cancer in smokers is 5 (10/2).Absolute risk is the probability or risk of developing a disease over time and is typically stated as an incidence or prevalence rate.Absolute risk reduction or risk difference is the difference between an exposed group's disease rate and a control/unexposed groups event rate. Again using the example above if 10% of smokers develop a type of cancer and only 2% of non smokers develop that cancer the absolute risk reduction is 10-2 i.e.8%Odds Ratio is the relative measure of effect, comparing the exposure group of a study relative to the control group.

He dies three days later with pneumonia.,A 69-year-old male with pneumoconiosis is admitted with fever and breathlessness. He dies two days later from pneumonia.,A 72-year-old male is admitted with a myocardial infarction and dies 48 hours following admission.,A 73-year-old female who had undergone a hip replacement two months previously presents with severe chest pain and breathlessness. She is diagnosed with pulmonary embolism but dies.,C,"Pneumoconiosis is considered an occupational lung disease and because of this the family may be entitled to compensation, especially if there is thought to be a reduction in the length or quality of life because of the illness. All deaths involving asbestos or pneumoconiosis in the UK should be discussed with the coroner. Increasingly, emphasis is placed on the appropriate reporting of deaths particularly from the enquiries into Shipman and the Coroners Reform Bill. In fact, it is the duty of the Registrar of Births, Deaths and Marriages to report a death to the coroner but doctors need to be aware of the circumstances in which a death should be reported. Such circumstances include where:  The cause of death is unknown. The deceased was not seen by the certifying doctor either after death or within 14 days before death. The death was violent or unnatural. The death may be due to an accident. The death may be due to self neglect or neglect by others. The death may be the result of industrial illness or due to the person's employment (as with the 69-year-old male above, pneumoconiosis being an industrial disease). The death may be due to an abortion. The death occurred during an operation or before recovery from anaesthesia. The death may be suicide. The death occurred during or shortly after being taken into police custody.  The death is due to an acute intoxication with alcohol, drugs or other substance misuse. With regard to the fifth option, this does not necessarily need to be discussed with the coroner. The paperwork completed when a patient dies asks you whether the patient had an operation within the last year of life. You are then asked to document whether you think this had a direct effect on shortening the patient's life. It is difficult to say whether a PE two months following a procedure is directly related to the operation and therefore such cases must be assessed individually. "

The absolute risk reduction is 2% (4–2 = 2%) , i.e. there were 2% fewer migraines in people taking the drug.Therefore, the absolute risk reduction for the scenario described in the question is 876/1903 or 46%.The control event rate = the rate at which events occur in a control group. It may be represented by a percentage (e.g. 10%) or as a proportion (e.g. 0.1). In simpler words, it describes the rate that good events occur with placebo.

When you review him he appears to have carpopedal spasm and is significantly distressed. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his spasm?",Hyperventilation syndrome,Hypocalcaemia,Hypokalaemia,Hypophosphataemia,Hypoxia,B,"The answer is hypocalcaemia. The clue here is the multiple blood transfusions which represent a significant citrate load. This leads to chelation of calcium ions and thus can precipitate a large fall in ionised calcium and symptoms of hypocalcaemia including pins and needles and tetany. This presentation should precipitate urgent ECG monitoring with a VBG to check ionised calcium, and appropriate IV calcium replacement. Hypokalaemia may also be seen as a result of massive blood transfusion, but it is not a cause of tetany. Hypophosphataemia is seen in alcoholic patients as a result of refeeding with high carbohydrate feeds which are low in dietary phosphate, but again, does not present with tetany. Although hyperventilation syndrome is a cause of tetany, it is unlikely to be responsible here, given that citrate loading is a possibility and hyperventilation would be obvious on examination."

Ninety per cent of patients taking morphine require antiemetics (morphine stimulates D2 receptors in the CTZ). Cyclizine, although commonly used, is less effective. Domperidone also has some central D2 antagonism but less than haloperidol. Ondansetron is a 5HT3 antagonist and is mainly used in post-chemotherapy or radiotherapy induced nausea.

Which of these medications should be avoided in this situation?",Cyclizine,Fentanyl,Haloperidol,Morphine,Paracetamol,D,"Morphine has active metabolites which accumulate with renal impairment and can lead to opioid toxicity. Morphine should, therefore, be avoided in this situation. Fentanyl is a good alternative in this situation as the same problem does not occur. Cyclizine, haloperidol, and paracetamol can all be used in renal impairment but the dose should be altered and patient monitored for side effects."

health humanities,104,A 35-year-old woman has been admitted to the local hospice for control of pain. She has been diagnosed with advanced cervical cancer and has continued chemotherapy. During her prolonged admission to the hospice she is transferred to the local oncology centre for cisplatin chemotherapy. The following day she is profoundly nauseated. The staff nurse looking after this lady asks you to prescribe an antiemetic. Which is the most appropriate antiemetic for this indication?,Cyclizine,Domperidone,Haloperidol,Metoclopramide,Ondansetron,E,"Ondansetron is a potent 5HT3-receptor antagonist. It is an especially useful antiemetic when nausea results from a massive release of serotonin (5HT) from enterochromaffin cells (for example, post-chemotherapy). Certain chemotherapy agents (for example, cisplatin) have a high 'emesis risk' and treatment with ondansetron or other related drugs is essential. In the United Kingdom 5HT3 antagonists are licensed only for post-chemotherapy and post-operative nausea."

That is, if we take a probability of 0.01 or less as constituting reasonable evidence against the null hypothesis, if it is in fact true, we shall make a wrong decision one in a hundred times. Type 2 error We get a type 2 error if we decide in favour of a null hypothesis which is in fact false (Hg is accepted when it is false - we fail to believe in a truth). Type 2 errors occur when not rejecting a null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is the true state of nature."
health humanities,106,A 30 year old patient attends colposcopy clinic. She advises you that she is a smoker and asks if she is at increased risk of cervical cancer. You advise her the relative risk of developing cervical cancer in smokers is 1.5. She asks what you mean by relative risk (RR). Which of the below best describes RR?,The difference in rate of a condition between an exposed population and an unexposed population,"Relative measure of effect, comparing the exposure group of a study relative to the control group",The difference between an exposed group's disease rate and a control/unexposed groups disease rate.,The probability or risk of developing a disease,Probability of disease in exposed group divided by probability of disease in unexposed group,E,"Relative risk is the probability of disease in exposed group divided by probability of disease in unexposed group. It is sometimes called the risk ratio. For example if 10% of smokers develop a type of cancer and only 2% of non smokers develop that cancer the relative risk of developing cancer in smokers is 5 (10/2).Absolute risk is the probability or risk of developing a disease over time and is typically stated as an incidence or prevalence rate.Absolute risk reduction or risk difference is the difference between an exposed group's disease rate and a control/unexposed groups event rate. Again using the example above if 10% of smokers develop a type of cancer and only 2% of non smokers develop that cancer the absolute risk reduction is 10-2 i.e.8%Odds Ratio is the relative measure of effect, comparing the exposure group of a study relative to the control group. For the example above. It would be calculated by odds of cancer in exposed group (diseased 10%/healthy 90%) divided by odds of cancer in control group (diseased 2%/healthy 98%) = 5.4Attributable risk (AR) is the difference in rate of a condition between an exposed population and an unexposed population. It is calculated in the same was as absolute risk reduction (ARR). AR is usually applied to describe risks that promote disease e.g. smoking, asbestos exposure etc whereas ARR is typically used to describe disease interventions e.g. statins, anticoagulation etc. Risk Relative RiskRelative risk (RR) is the ratio of risk in an exposed group to a non exposed groupRR = Probability of an event when exposed/Probability of event in control groupGroup Disease Present Disease AbsentExposed a bControl c dIt can be calculated by RR = [a / (a+b)] ÷ [c / (c+d)]A relative risk of 1 means there is no difference in risk between control and exposed groups.Odds RatioOdds ratio (OR) = [a÷b] ÷ [c÷d]"

The nature of cross sectional studies offers a quick and easy way for a researcher to quickly amass data. It allows quick and easy data gathering even for a large target population. The ease of gathering the required information translates into cost effectiveness, as many hospital and census bureaus have that information already in hand. A group of patients with and without disease is identified and both the tests, the one being studied and a reference standard test, are given to each patient. There are two general approaches, case control (includes group with known disease and a group with no disease) and cohort (includes a group of patients suspected of having the disease) is given both the test being studied. The latter is a faster and cheaper way to study a test but is more subject to bias."

The police are keen to obtain a blood sample for alcohol measurement but the patient is incapable of giving consent for this procedure and there is no forensic physician who can do so. You are working in the Aandamp;E unit but are not directly involved in the clinical care of this patient. The police have asked you to obtain a sample of blood for analysis.

According to the document, this is what the law has to say:  A blood specimen may be taken for future testing for alcohol or other drugs from a person who has been involved in an accident and is unable to give consent where a police constable believes the person to be incapable of giving valid consent due to medical reasons. A forensic physician must be asked to take the sample unless this is not reasonably practicable, in which case another doctor may be asked. A request may not be made of a doctor who has any responsibility for the clinical care of the patient. A specimen can only be taken by the doctor to whom the request is made; the task cannot be delegated. It is a requirement of the legislation that, before the specimen is taken, the doctor in charge of the patient's care has been notified of the intention to take blood and has not objected on the grounds that such action would be prejudicial to the patient's care. The specimen may not be tested until the person regains competence and gives valid consent for it to be tested. A person who fails to give permission for the testing of a specimen, without reasonable excuse, is guilty of an offence. The police have no powers to take and test blood specimens that were taken as part of the patient's care in hospital.  Following the Police Reform Act, it is no longer necessary to obtain consent from unconscious or incapacitated drivers. However, the sample is not tested until the person regains competence and gives valid consent to it being tested. A competent person who refuses to allow his or her sample to be tested might be liable to prosecution. The new law recognises the duty to justice."

CbD is one of the tools used to collect evidence for your Trainee ePortfolio, as part of the Workplace Based Assessment component of the MRCGP exam.How Case-based Discussion (CbD) worksThe CBD tool has been designed to be used in both hospital and GP settings. Selecting cases for CBDAs a GP trainee, you're responsible for selecting cases, requesting a CbD and ensuring the paperwork is completed properly. You and your trainer should ensure that your ePortfolio reflects a balance of cases, including:children mental health cancer and palliative care older adultsCases should also reflect different contexts: surgery, home visits and out-of-hours contacts. You can't include cases that have already been used as a debrief.Specialty training years one and two (ST1 and ST2)In ST1 and ST2, you'll select two cases. You present the clinical entries and relevant records to your clinical supervisor or educational supervisor one week before the discussion.Your clinical or educational supervisor selects one of these cases for discussion.Specialty training year three (ST3)In ST3, you'll present four cases to your trainer or educational supervisor one week before the discussion. They will select one or two for discussion.What's covered in the discussionThe discussion is framed around the actual case rather than hypothetical events. Questions should be designed to elicit evidence of competence: the discussion should not shift into a test of knowledge.Your trainer or educational supervisors will aim to cover as many relevant competences as possible in the time available. It's unrealistic to expect all competences to be covered in a single CbD, but if there are too few you won't have sufficient evidence of progress. It's helpful to establish at the start of the discussion which competence areas your trainer or supervisor is expecting to look at.The trainer or educational supervisor records the evidence harvested for the CbD in the Trainee ePortfolio, against the appropriate competences.It is recommended that each discussion should take about 30 minutes, including the discussion itself, completing the rating form and providing feedback.Clinical Evaluation Exercise (MiniCEX) for use in hospital posts only The Clinical Evaluation Exercise (miniCEX) assesses clinical skills, attitudes and behaviours in a secondary care setting. It's one of the tools used to collect evidence for your Trainee ePortfolio, as part of the Workplace Based Assessment component of our MRCGP exam.How miniCEX worksThe miniCEX provides a 15-minute snapshot of how you interact with patients in a secondary care setting.Preparing for miniCEXEach miniCEX should represent a different clinical problem, and you should have drawn samples from a wide range of problem groups by the end of the speciality training years one and two (ST1 and ST2).Conducting miniCEXThe miniCEX can be assessed by the clinical supervisor and we would encourage that the clinical supervisor who will go on to complete the trainee’s clinical supervisor report does at least one required miniCEX, a consultant or a hospital doctor ST4 or above (or SAS equivalent). The observer should not be a peer - a fellow GP trainee or specialty trainee at a similar stage in training.The assessor needs to have received the appropriate training to complete the assessment.Using miniCEX feedbackThe observer will give you immediate feedback and the evidence will be rated and recorded in your Trainee ePortfolio. You'll develop a learning plan based on the strengths and developmental needs observed and record it in the Learning Log within your ePortfolio."

The GP asked for admission for help with symptom control. On questioning, the patient complains of low back pain with occasional feeling of weakness and 'tingling' in her legs. There has been no bowel or bladder disturbance. On examination there is some tenderness over L2 and power in both legs is slightly reduced. There are no other abnormalities to find. Which is the most appropriate intital management?",Arrange lumbar x ray,Arrange urgent MRI,Bed rest,Increase analgesia and arrange physiotherapy,Urgent referral to local oncology service and start high dose steroid,E,"Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is defined as spinal cord or cauda equina compression by direct pressure and/or induction of vertebral collapse or instability by metastatic spread or direct extension of malignancy that threatens or causes neurological disability. The true incidence of MSCC in England and Wales is not known but studies have suggested it is as much as 80 cases per million per year (approximately 4000 per year). MSCC is a medical emergency and a low index of suspicion is required as the initial features may be non-specific. Recent studies have shown the median times from the onset of back pain and nerve root pain to referral were 3 months and 9 weeks respectively. Nearly half of all patients with MSCC were unable to walk at the time of diagnosis and of these, 67% had recovered no function after one month. In this scenario, there is a significant chance of MSCC and you are in an out-of-hospital setting so urgent referral to the oncologists is the most appropriate answer and adminstration of high dose steroids. NICE guidance recommends this is done immediately in anybody with neurological symptoms and signs, and patients transferred to a unit with 24-hour capability for MRI and definitive treatment of MSCC. The oncologists are likely to recommend high dose dexamethasone whilst awaiting transfer. If you were in a hospital setting you would want to discuss the case with the oncologists and orthopaedic surgeons and organise an MRI scan. This MRI should be of the whole spine, unless there is a specific contraindication. NICE recommends it be carried out within 24 hours in patients with neurological signs, and within one week if there is spinal pain suggestive of metastases. Occasionally the MRI should be carried out sooner if there is a pressing clinical need for emergency surgery, but out of hours MRI should only be performed in clinical circumstances where there is an emergency need and intention to proceed immediately to treatment. This should therefore be decided by either the oncology or orthopaedic team. Definitive treatment of MSCC is either surgery or radiotherapy. At present, relatively few patients with MSCC in the UK receive surgery. However, research evidence suggests that early surgery may be more effective than radiotherapy at maintaining mobility in a selected subset of patients. "

For example you might want to investigate the proportion of women taking pre conceptual folic acid in different socioeconomic groups.ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)ANOVA is a method for testing the hypothesis that there is no difference between two or more population means (usually at least three). ANOVA is used to test for differences among several means without increasing the Type I error rate which can occur if comparing multiple means by conducting multiple t-tests.Rank Sum TestsWilcoxan and Mann Whitney U tests are both rank sum tests. These are Nonparametric tests of the null hypothesis that two samples come from the same population against an alternative hypothesis, especially that a particular population tends to have larger values than the other. Unlike the t-test it does not require the assumption of normal distributions. It is nearly as efficient as the t-test on normal distributions"
health humanities,132,What is the minimum dataset required for matching a patient and a sample for purpose of a blood transfusion request?,Full name and gender,"Full name, gender and patient identity number","Full name, gender, address and patient identity number","Full name, gender, date of birth, address and patient identity number","Full name, gender, previous blood grouping details, address and patient identity number",D,"Given that maximum errors and near misses occur because of mislabelling or mistaken identity of patient or the sample a minimum data set is prescribed for transfusion requests. This involves recording the full name, gender, date of birth, address (in some areas) and patient identity number. Previous blood grouping details are not required and missing elements of this minimum dataset are not acceptable in the transfusion service."
health humanities,133,"You are working in a hospice for a palliative medicine team and you are called by one of the local GPs for medication advice. A patient of hers has recently been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and associated severe pain. The GP started the patient on morphine sulphate modified release and an antiemetic. Two days after starting the antiemetic the patient came back to see the GP complaining of feeling more sleepy, blurred vision at times, constipation, and a very dry mouth. On which antiemetic was the patient most likely to have been started?",Cyclizine,Domperidone,Haloperidol,Metoclopramide,Ondansetron,A,"Cyclizine is a commonly used antihistamine antiemetic and its primary site of action is the vomiting centre (which is rich in histamine and muscarinic cholinergic receptors). Cyclizine has a strong affinity for muscarinic receptors and therefore anticholinergic side effects (dry mouth, drowsiness, blurred vision, constipation, etc) are common, especially in the first few days. The other drugs listed do not have significant muscarinic receptor affinity."

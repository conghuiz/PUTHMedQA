immune system,1,"A 67-year-old woman with polymyalgia rheumatica was commenced on prednisolone 15 mg/day, and had excellent therapeutic response. The steroid dose has now been reduced to 10 mg/day, and the plan is to continue tapering the prednisolone dose by 1 mg/month, aiming to discontinue prednisolone in a year's time. Which of the following is the best approach to osteoporosis prophylaxis for her?",Alendronic acid,"Alendronic acid, and calcium carbonate + vitamin D",Calcium carbonate,Calcium carbonate + vitamin D,Check bone mineral density,B,"Oral glucocorticoids are associated with significant increase in fracture risk from doses as low as 5 mg daily. Loss of bone mineral density is greatest in the first few months of glucocorticoid therapy, but fracture risk declines rapidly after stopping. There is an increased risk of fracture over and above the effect of low bone mineral density. Patients older than 65 years are considered at high risk of osteoporotic fractures, as are those with a prior fragility fracture, and they should commence on bone protective therapy at the time of starting glucocorticoid therapy. Measurement of bone density is not required before starting therapy. In patients younger than 65 years without risk factors, DEXA scan is recommended for assessment of fracture risk. General measures to reduce bone loss include use of the lowest dose of glucocorticoids possible, and steroid-sparing agents. Dietary calcium should be increased and appropriate physical activity should be encouraged, with smoking and alcohol minimised. Daily intake 1,500 mg of calcium and 800 U of vitamin D3 is recommended. Bone protective therapy which can be used includes alendronate, alfacalcidol, calcitonin, calcitriol, cyclic etidronate and risedronate. "
immune system,2,A 32-year-old woman presents with malaise fatigue and fever. She complains about weight loss. Examinations: malar rash with sparing of nasolabial fold can be seen. What is the most appropriate investigation?,Anti ds DNA,Anti histone,Anti centromere,Anti Jo,Anti Scl70,A,Features are suggestive of SLE. So most appropriate investigation from the given options is A. Anti ds DNA antibodies
immune system,3,A 4 year old girl is complaining of pain in her thigh and hip.  On examination she is tender on palpation of the thigh.  Her bloods show elevated inflammatory markers.  An ultrasound and x-ray of the hip and femur is normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hip fracture,Septic arthritis,Bone tumour,Osteomyelitis,Perthes disease,D,"The most likely is osteomyelitis as the pain is in the thigh.  It is unlikely to be a fracture or bone tumour due to the normal x-ray.  However osteomyelitis does not show up on the x-ray initially and then later it can show haziness and loss of density of the bone, then followed by subperiosteal reaction and sequestrum. Septic arthritis is unlikely as the joint is normal.  Perthe’s disease is osteochondritis of the epiphysis of the femoral head and there would normally be x-ray findings with the earliest being widening of the joint space, followed by  loss of the nuclear femoral head with patchy density.  It does not cause raised inflammatory markers."
immune system,4,"A 50 year old presents with sudden onset, atraumatic shoulder pain.  On examination there is tenderness over the greater tuberosity of the humerus and subacromial bursa and there is a restriction in his range of abduction.  An xray reveals calcification of the supraspinatus tendon.  What is true regarding calcification of the supraspinatus tendon?",It does not ever also involve the infraspinatus,The calcification is most likely composed of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals,The calcification is most likely composed of calcium urate crystals,The calcification is most likely composed of Calcium pyrophosphate,NSAIDS and physio are not useful,B,The calcification is usually caused by deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite crystals within injured rotator cuff muscles near the humeral attachment region. CPPD deposition is seen in pseudogout and urate in gout.  It can involve the infraspinatus and subscapularis tendons.  Physiotherapy and NSAIDs are useful in the management.
immune system,5,"A 50-year-old woman presents with dry eyes, a dry mouth, an erythematous rash and polyarthralgia. Investigations show:    Anti-nuclear antibody Strongly positive (1:1600)   Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies Strongly positive   Rheumatoid factor Positive   IgG 45 g/L (less than15)   IgM Normal   IgA Normal   Kappa/lambda ratio Normal    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hyperviscosity syndrome,Myeloma associated vasculitis,Primary Sjögren's syndrome,Rheumatoid arthritis with secondary Sjögren's syndrome,Systemic lupus erythematosus,C,"The clinical features and the serology are typical of primary Sjögren's syndrome (occurs alone and more likely to have positive anti Ro SSA antibodies than secondary Sjögren's). Hypergammaglobulinaemia is present in 80% of individuals. The normal kappa/lambda ratio confirms the hypergammaglobulinaemia is polyclonal. Autoantibodies include rheumaroid factors, antinuclear antibodies, and multiple organ-specific antibodies (inc. antigastric parietal cells, thyroglobulin thyroid microsomal, mitochondrial, smooth muscle and salivary duct antibodies). Antibodies to Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) are also common. ANA and anti-Ro/SSA antibodies are present in approximately 90% of individuals as is a weakly positive rheumatoid factor. Typically secondary Sjögren's has pre-existent rheumatoid or systemic lupus erythematosus before the development of Sjögren's symptoms."
immune system,6,"A 43 year old presents in winter after noticing her fingers become painful and blue when it is cold.  She has also noticed thick skin on her hands.  She also complains of heartburn.  On examination she has sclerodactyly and telangiectasia.  Her anticentromere antibody is positive and her bloods reveal renal impairment.  Considering the most likely diagnosis, what would be the most likely cause of death?",GI haemorrhage,Interstitial Lung Disease,Myocardial Infarction,Malignancy,Renal Failure,E,In approximately 50% of patients with scleroderma Renal failure is the cause of death.  Pulmonary hypertension and ILD is also a significant cause of mortality.  Increase oesophageal cancer is seen due to oesophagitis and there is increased levels of bronchial carcinoma seen.
immune system,7,"In cryoglobulinaemia, what is the most likely diagnosis if there is both a monoclonal and polyclonal element?",Amyloidosis,Hepatitis B,Rheumatoid arthritis,Hepatitis C,Haematological malignancy,D,Cryoglobulinaemia secondary to Hepatitis C leads to a mixed cryoglobulinaemia i.e. monoclonal and polyclonal elements.
immune system,8,"A 78-year-old man presents with an acute onset of severe pain and swelling of the left wrist which had developed since he had a chest infection two weeks previously. On examination he had a temperature of 38 °C and the left wrist was red, swollen and painful. What is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",Erythrocyte sedimentation rate,Full blood count,Joint aspiration,Serum urate concentration,x Ray of the joint,C,"This gentleman has presented with an acute onset monoarthritis. A destructive septic arthritis is a potential diagnosis, and must be excluded as a matter of urgency. An aspirate is the most crucial step to exclude this and allow the timely commencement of appropriate antibiotics. Differential diagnoses include gout and pseudogout, which can also be diagnosed on joint aspiration. ESR will be raised in many causes of joint inflammation or infection, and is therefore not helpful in establishing a diagnosis in the acute situation. It can be used to guide treatment in inflammatory arthropathies after a diagnosis is made. Full blood count is also non-specific and often does not assist in making a diagnosis. Hyperuricaemia is a pre-requisite for gout, but normal serum urate levels at presentation does not exclude an acute gouty attack. It is therefore not the most appropriate investigation in this case. In the acute stages of septic arthritis there may be no signs of damage to the joint seen on a radiograph. It may show typical changes of calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate deposition or gout, which may help in his long term management, but would not change management in the acute situation."
immune system,9,What is the earliest clinical finding in Ankylosing Spondylitis?,Lumbar tenderness,Reduction in chest expansion,Paraspinal muscle wasting,Lumbar lordosis retention during flexion,Hip deformity,D,The earliest finding is retention of lumbar lordosis during spinal flexion followed by paraspinal muscle wasting.  Due to costochondritis there can be a reduction in chest expansion.
immune system,10,"A 70-year-old retired sea captain develops weakness of the shoulders and hips over a four month period. He has also noticed weak finger flexors with normal strength in straightening them. He has had some difficulty swallowing liquids. There is no past medical history, apart from a sexually transmitted disease picked up in the South Pacific some forty years before. This was treated with antibiotics and he is not sure of the diagnosis. He smokes a pipe and drinks one or two tots of rum at the weekend. A creatine kinase level comes back at 120. Which investigation is most likely to give a definite diagnosis?",Anti Jo 1 antibody titres,CT scan of the chest,EMG,Muscle biopsy with electron microscopy,24 hour urine collection for myoglobin,D,"The diagnosis is inclusion body myositis (IBM). This is an inflammatory condition that affects the over 50s. Proximal muscles and finger flexors are predominantly involved, but distal muscle groups may also be involved. The onset of muscle weakness in IBM is generally gradual (over months or years). IBM occurs more frequently in men than women. Creatine kinase (CK) may be normal. Jo 1 titres are often raised in dermatomyositis associated with lung disease. Electromyogram (EMG) shows a similar pattern in polymyositis and IBM - small short duration motor unit arrythmias can complicate polymyositis and dermatomyositis, but not IBM. There is no association of IBM with malignancy. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis show a much better response to steroids than IBM. Biopsy in IBM shows intranuclear or cytoplasmic tubofilaments on electron microscopy."
immune system,11,"A 35-year-old woman has butterfly rash on her face and she suffers symmetrical joint pains on knee and elbow, ESR is raised. What is the most discriminative investigation for diagnosis?",Anti DNA antibodies,Anti Jo1 antibodies,Anti nuclear antibodies,Anti centromere antibodies,Anti la antibodies,A,Anti DNA antibodies to diagnose SLE
immune system,12,A 25 year old gentleman presents to his GP with pains in his left knee and ankles.  He is also suffering from dysuria and red eye.  He has noticed plaques on the palms of his hands and soles of his feet and a rash on his glans penis.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,SLE,Psoriatic Arthritis,Reiters syndrome,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,C,"Reiters syndrome is the triad of arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis.  It can be associated with keratoderma blennorrhagic which are psoriatic like lesions.  It most often follows chlamydia or GI infections such as with shigella, campylobacter and salmonella.    Reactive arthritis can lead to an asymmetrical lower limb arthritis also but not the other features.  The other diagnoses are much less likely."
immune system,13,A 76-year-old lady with stable congestive cardiac failure presents to the Emergency department at 11 pm with a two day history of a painful hot swollen right knee. She is unable to weight bear. She lives alone. Her temperature is 37.4°C. Which of the following is the most crucial step in her management?,"Aspirate the right knee for urgent Gram stain, microscopy,culture and sensitivity",Provide non-steroidal anti-inflammatory for pain relief,Prescribe paracetamol and discharge home with GP follow up,"Take a full history from the patient, in particular, enquire into any previous episodes of joint pain",x Ray the right knee,A,"This lady has presented with an acute onset monoarthritis. A destructive septic arthritis is a potential diagnosis and must be excluded as a matter of urgency. An aspirate is the most crucial step to exclude this and allow the timely commencement of appropriate antibiotics. Differential diagnoses include gout and pseudogout, which can also be diagnosed on joint aspiration. Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatories would be useful as pain relief they may exacerbate the congestive cardiac failure and should be used with caution. Also the renal function must be checked to ensure a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory can be used. Discharging home with paracetamol is not an acceptable management plan as the lady lives alone and cannot weight bear. She is unlikely to cope and will be at risk of falls. A full history is imperative in formulating a differential diagnosis. For example, previous similar episodes in her great toes and the use of diuretics may suggest a diagnosis of acute gout. However, this does not exclude a destructive septic arthritis. An aspirate is the most crucial step to exclude this and allow the timely commencement of appropriate antibiotics. In the acute stages of septic arthritis there may be no signs of damage to the joint seen on a radiograph. It may show typical changes of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease or gout, which may help in her long term management, but this would not change the management in this acute situation."
immune system,14,Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody against which molecule?,Fc receptor,CD81,CD20,Tyrosine kinase receptor,CD4,C,Rituximab is a chimeric monoclonal antibody against the pan-B-cell marker CD20 and has been approved for use in non Hodgkins Lymphoma.
immune system,15,"A 28-year-old man presented with acute stiffness and swelling of his knees and ankles, and a painful rash on his legs. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 86 mm in the first hour (0-15). Chest x ray showed hilar lymphadenopathy. What is the most likely outcome?",Chronic arthritis,Pulmonary fibrosis,Renal failure,Skin ulceration,Spontaneous improvement,E,"The description is typical of acute sarcoidosis with erythema nodosum, polyarthropathy and hilar lymphadenopathy. This has a good prognosis and usually resolves spontaneously over six to eight weeks. ESR is a largely non-specific test but does suggest underlying chronic inflammation seen in a number of the conditions mentioned above,  Chronic arthritis though not impossible here does not normally occur in sarcoid. Pulmonary fibrosis is an umbrella term for a number of conditions which usually leads to significant shortness of breath, dry cough and reduced exercise tolerance. The chest x ray findings are usually bilateral fine pulmonary infiltrates. Though it can occur ion sarcoid it is rare.  Renal failure can present with arthropathy in the context of hypocalacaemia and hyperphosphataemia but this is not the case here. sarcodi rarely leads to this. Skin changes with sarcoid are usually erythema nodosum, not ulceration."
immune system,16,"Regarding chemical nature of antibodies , heavy chains are linked together by",Peptide bonds,Covalent bonds to a mutual carbon atom,Ionic bonds,Disulphide bonds,None of the above,D,ANTIBODY STRUCTURE
immune system,17,"A 55-year-old nurse developed bronchospasm and urticaria twenty minutes into surgery under general anaesthesia. The mast cell tryptase concentration confirmed an acute allergic reaction. Later, it transpired that she had developed allergic reactions at her dentist and had developed frequent episodes of wheezing when assisting at sterile procedures. Whih of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergy to anaesthetic induction agents,Allergy to local anaesthetic agents,Latex allergy ,Pressure urticaria,Systemic mastocytosis,C,"This patient developed anaphylaxis during a surgical procedure and it appears that she had problems with allergies during dental treatment and whilst assisting during sterile procedures. This would suggest that she is allergic to latex rather than induction agents or local anaesthesia as latex would be present in all three of the above procedures. Systemic mastocytosis is a disease which usually affects the elderly and is associated with:  urticaria pigmentosa diarrhoea hypotension sclerotic bone changes, and mast cell infiltration of organs such as spleen, liver, and kidneys.  The other options don't fit with the history."
immune system,18,Which of the following is a pro-inflammatory cytokine?,C reactive protein,IL-4,IL-10,Serum amyloid precursor protein,Tumour necrosis factor - alpha,E,"C reactive protein and serum amyloid precursor protein are acute phase reactants. IL-4 and IL-10 are anti-inflammatory cytokines. TNF-alpha is a pro-inflammatory cytokine. In inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, the levels of TNF-alpha are markedly elevated in inflamed joints. Treatments directed at the inhibition of TNF-alpha such as infliximab (a monoclonal antibody against TNF-alpha) have been shown to be very effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and also effective in fistulating Crohn's disease."
immune system,19,"A 34-year-old man with psoriasis has a three week history of painful swollen right knee and difficulty walking. He has early morning stiffness of over an hour. He drinks six units of alcohol/week and has not had any recent infections. On examination there is a right knee effusion, and swollen and tender distal interphalangeal joints in right hand index and middle finger. Here are the results of recent blood tests:    Haemoglobin 140 g/L (130-180)   WBC 9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 6 ×10^9/L (1.5-7.0)   ESR 45 mm/hr (0-15)   Urea, electrolytes and creatinine Normal   Rheumatoid factor Negative    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Gout,Osteoarthritis,Psoriatic arthritis,Reactive arthritis (RA),Rheumatoid arthritis,C,"This patient has psoriatic arthritis. Among people who develop psoriatic arthritis, two-thirds develop joint symptoms after skin involvement. In the absence of psoriasis, a positive family history of psoriasis in a first degree relative supports the diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. RA is unlikely as there is asymmetrical joint involvement - with predominant involvement of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints in the hands. DIP joint involvement is a distinctive feature of psoriatic arthritis. DIP joint involvement associates with dactylitis, nail pitting and onycholysis (separation of nail from nail bed). The absence of preceding infection makes reactive arthritis unlikely. Gout is unlikely. The alcohol intake is not excessive, and except for male gender, there is no other risk factor, for example, age greater than 40 years, diuretic use, renal failure and solid organ transplant."
immune system,20,A 35-year-old lady presented with left sided weakness. She has a young family with a 5-year-old son and a 2-year-old daughter. Previously she had two spontaneous abortions. After the birth of her last child she developed a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and received three months of anticoagulation with warfarin. On examination she has left sided weakness with pyramidal signs. A CT head scan shows a hyperdense region within the superior sagittal sinus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome,Hypertension,Kawasaki syndrome,Patent foramen ovale,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,A,"This patient has a prothrombotic tendency suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome with recurrent abortions, previous DVT and now she has developed a left hemiparesis with imaging findings suggesting a venous sinus thrombosis (MRI or MRV would be more conclusive). This patient has antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APAS). APAS can be diagnosed if the patient has anticardiolipin antibodies, or lupus anticoagulant on two occasions, over a period of 12 weeks, and has had either:  a thrombus, or a history of recurrent less than10 week pregnancy loss, or one pregnancy loss greater than10 weeks in gestation when other causes of pregnancy loss have been excluded.  The occurrence of even a single thrombotic event in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome warrants lifelong anticoagulation, as the risk of recurrence is 20-70%. Low molecular weight heparin should be used initially whilst loading warfarin. In general, it is recommended that the INR is maintained above 2.0, although a higher level (above 3) may be indicated for patients with recurrent thrombosis on treatment. Anticoagulation to prevent fetal loss remains controversial. "
immune system,21,A 16-year-old girl presents with a three month history of polyarthralgia and marked early morning stiffness. Her symptoms respond well to diclofenac but she is becoming increasingly concerned about her symptoms which appear to be progressing. She is otherwise well apart from a history of acne which is well controlled on minocycline. Her mother has severe rheumatoid arthritis. Investigations reveal:    ESR 50 mm/hr (0-20)   CRP 100 mg/L (less than10)   Rheumatoid factor Negative   ANA Strongly positive (1:1600)   Anti-dsDNA antibodies Negative   IgG 25 g/L (less than15)    What is the most likely cause?,Drug-induced SLE,Fibromyalgia,Rheumatoid arthritis,Sero-negative spondyloarthropathy,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),A,"The history strongly suggests inflammatory problems and the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) confirm this. Rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) would be on the differential diagnosis. The serology is atypical for rheumatoid arthritis and the marked elevation of the CRP would be very unusual for SLE where characteristically CRP elevation indicates underlying bacterial infection or widespread serositis. The most likely diagnosis is drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Classically, this is characterised by systemic disease with a lower incidence of nephritis, lack of cutaneous involvement and the presence of anti-histone antibodies.^1 The most commonly associated drugs have historically been procainamide and hydralazine, although their use is now decreasing. Medications associated more recently include the anti-TNF alpha agents, statins and minocycline. Minocycline is unusual in that it seems to be associated with the development of long-term immunological memory, and therefore exacerbation of symptoms within 12-24 hours of rechallenge.^2 Minocycline has been well documented as a cause of drug-induced SLE. Characteristically, the ESR and CRP are both markedly elevated, the ANA is strongly positive and there is a hypergammaglobulinaemia. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are usually negative; anti-histone antibodies are positive in 95% of drug-induced lupus (but also 50-80% of idiopathic SLE).^3 A strongly positive ANA is a risk factor for developing drug-induced lupus, but a negative ANA would not exclude the diagnosis.^2 Drug-induced lupus is defined as a lupus-like syndrome temporally related to continuous drug exposure which resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug.^4 There are several features which distinguish drug-induced lupus from idiopathic SLE. Males and females are equally affected in drug-induced lupus, whereas idiopathic SLE affects females nine times more frequently.^3 Caucasians are affected by drug-induced lupus more commonly than Afro-Caribbeans, whereas the inverse is true of idiopathic SLE. In addition, the age of onset is typically older in drug-induced lupus, but this depends on the age at drug exposure. Fever, arthralgia, serositis and ANA occur at least as frequently in drug-induced lupus as idiopathic SLE; haematological, renal and CNS involvement, and double-stranded DNA autoantibodies are rare.^3 The pathogenesis of drug-induced lupus is unclear. Factors that influence drug metabolism, such as acetylator status, have been implicated. In addition, lupus-inducing drugs have been shown to generate a variety of cytotoxic products on exposure to MPO released from activated neutrophils.^2 The time taken for symptoms to resolve after stopping minocycline is highly variable, from a few days to two years. Typically, no further treatment is required but there are situations where corticosteroids or DMARDs are required to aid resolution^3. "

immune system,23,"A 76-year-old man presents with a painful, swollen right knee and difficulty in walking for three days. On examination, his temperature is 36.8°C. The right knee is red, swollen, warm and tender and has restricted movement. The knee aspirate shows no organisms on Gram stain, 200 leucocytes/mm^3, and weakly positively birefringent crystals on polarised light microscopy. The results of recent blood tests are:    Haemoglobin 123 g/L (130-180)   WBC 14.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 88% (40-75)   Platelet 340 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Urea, electrolytes and creatinine Normal   ESR 79 mm/hr (0-20)   Urate 321 µmol/L (210-415)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Gout,Osteoarthritis,Pseudogout,Reactive arthritis,Septic arthritis,C,"This presentation could be consistent with a number of diagnoses. However, the presence of positively birefringent crystals make pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy) the most likely diagnosis. It is critical to exclude septic arthritis, as it is potentially rapidly destructive, but the negative gram stain and low synovial fluid white cell count make this less likely. Classically pseudogout presents with a rapid onset of inflammatory symptoms and signs. Risk factors include:  age osteoarthritis, and metabolic disturbance (e.g. primary hyperparathyroidism, haemochromatosis).  Management of acute episodes include cool packs, rest, joint aspiration and steroid injection. Prophylaxis is typically with oral NSAIDs and/or low-dose colchicine. Oral corticosteroids, methotrexate or hydroxycholoroquine can be used in resistant disease. Asymptomatic crystal deposition does not need treatment. The differential does include gout but isolated monoarthritis of the knee is less common than with pseudogout. Distinguishing between the two depends on analysis of the crystals with calcium pyrophosphate crystals demonstrating no or positive birefringence and urate crystals demonstrating a negative birefringence under polarising light. The white cell count in septic arthritis is typically more than 2000/mm^3, with more than 75% polymorphonuclear leucocytes. Gram stain may be positive. Osteoarthritis of the knee usually presents as a more chronic mechanical joint pain. Reactive arthritis is more common in younger patients, and there is a typically a history of infection (usually gastroenterological or sexually-transmitted) which pre-dates the onset of joint symptoms.

Among these, aluminum hydroxide is the most commonly used chemical as adjuvant."
immune system,25,A 70 year old who is on warfarin for a pulmonary embolus presents with acute gout.  How would you manage this patient?,Colchicine,NSAIDs,Prednisolone,Allopurinol,Weak opioids,C,NSAIDs are useful for gout however with a person on warfarin these should be avoided due to the increased risk of bleeding.  Colchicine may lead to an increased INR.  Allopurinol should not be utilised in acute cases.  Weak opioids are not particularly useful.  Prednisolone is useful as it is anti inflammatory and reduces swelling and pain and can be used in conjunction with warfarin.

What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?",Atlantoaxial subluxation,Cauda equina syndrome,Cervical spine disc prolapsed,Pseudobulbar palsy,Spinal stenosis,A,"Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common inflammatory disease involving the spine. It has a predilection for the craniocervical spine. The three different patterns of instability which can result are:  Atlantoaxial subluxation Atlantoaxial impaction, and Subaxial subluxation.  Atlantoaxial subluxation (distance between the arch of atlas and odontoid peg greater than2.5 mm) may occur due to erosion of the odontoid process or due to laxity of the transverse ligament from rheumatoid pannus resulting in posterior subluxation of the odontoid. This can lead to cervical cord compression. In some patients, exuberant rheumatoid pannus around the odontoid peg may cause cervical spine compression without atlantoaxial subluxation. Basilar invagination, with upward migration of the odontoid peg into the foramen magnum may lead to cord compression, or to medullary compression (which may be fatal). Although radiographic changes are seen in up to 86% of patients, the prevalence of neurological deficit is relatively low. Radiographs should be taken laterally with the neck held in flexion. Only a minority of patients require surgical management. Non-surgical treatment options include patient education, lifestyle modification and regular radiographic follow up. MRI is indicated when myelopathy occurs or when plain radiographs show atlantoaxial subluxation with a posterior atlantodental interval less than 14 mm, any degree of atlantoaxial impaction or subaxial stenosis with a canal diameter less than 14 mm. Pseudobulbar palsy results from the degeneration of corticobulbar pathways to the lower cranial nerve nuclei. It presents with dysarthria, difficulty swallowing and weakness of the muscles of mastication. It is not commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Spinal stenosis, cauda equine syndrome and a prolapsed cervical disc could all present as described here but in the setting of rheumatoid arthritis atlantoaxial subluxation is more likely. "

immune system,33,"June, a 45-year-old woman has had arthritis for 16 weeks. She has morning stiffness lasting two hours. The hands, wrists, right elbow and knees are swollen. She also complains of painful feet. The ESR is 41 mm/hr and C reactive protein is 34 mg/L. The full blood count is normal. Which antibody test would you request if you suspected that she had early rheumatoid arthritis?",Antinuclear antibodies (ANA),Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP antibodies),Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA),Antiphospholipid antibodies,Complement,B,"High titres of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are associated with a large number of autoimmune diseases, most commonly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP antibodies) are highly specific and sensitive for rheumatoid arthritis and their titre correlates with erosive disease. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies should be used as one of the first line immunological investigations in suspected rheumatoid arthritis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are more commonly associated with vasculitides which the history does not suggest in this case. Antiphospholipid antibodies would be requested when the clinical presentation suggests a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. Complement is not an antibody test. Levels are generally performed in specific cases, for example, cryoglobulinaemia and SLE."

immune system,39,A 74-year-old man has extensive Paget's disease involving the lumbar spine and pelvis identified on an IVU for suspected renal stones. He is asymptomatic from the pagetic lesions. Blood tests show raised alkaline phosphatase and normal calcium. What is the next step in his management?,Calcitonin,No treatment necessary,Oral bisphosphonates,Parathyroid hormone,Radiotherapy,B,"Paget's disease of bone is a localised disorder of bone remodelling. There are increased numbers of giant osteoclasts which increase bone resorption with subsequent increase in new bone formation and altered bone architecture. The structure of the new bone is disorganised and mechanically weaker and therefore liable to pathological fracture and deformity. It can affect any bone, but is commonest in the axial skeleton, long bones and skull. The hands and feet are rarely affected. Both genetic and environmental factors are implicated, and it has been suggested paramyxovirus is involved. The majority of patients affected are over the age of 55, and men are more commonly affected. The United Kingdom has the highest prevalence of Paget's disease in the world. The signs and symptoms of Paget's are varied, depending on the location of involved sites and the degree of increased bone turnover. It is commonly asymptomatic and is discovered by an elevated serum alklaline phosphatase or typical radiographic findings. When symptoms do occur, the most common are bone pain and/or deformity. Deafness or tinnitus is not uncommon, due to compression of cranial nerve VIII. The most concerning complication is the development of osteosarcoma, which carries a poor prognosis. Treatment is indicated for bone pain, nerve compression, disease impinging on joints and immobilisation hypercalcaemia. In this case, this gentleman is asymptomatic and he should just be monitored. When indicated, management concentrates on control of pain and the reduction of complications. In addition to analgesia, bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment. These reduce bone turnover, improve pain, promote healing of osteolytic lesions and restore normal bone histology. Serial monitoring of alkaline phosphatase can help to monitor treatment. Calcitonin was used for the treatment of Paget's disease but has been superseded by bisphosphonates which are more effective. There is no role for radiotherapy, or parathyroid hormones in the treatment of Paget's disease. "
immune system,40,Which of the following is a recognised feature of polymyalgia rheumatica?,A peak incidence in the fourth decade of life,An association with bronchial carcinoma,Elevated serum creatine phosphokinase activity,Weakness of distal muscle groups,Weight loss,E,"Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is an inflammatory disease which typically presents with pain and stiffness of the the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. It can have either an acute or subacute onset and is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and therefore constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss and malaise. Muscle weakness is not a feature of PMR, but this can be difficult to assess in the presence of pain. Due to chronic inflammation, low-grade fever and weight loss are often present. Weight gain is unusual, and peripheral joints are only rarely affected. The course of the disease is unpredictable, and 30% of patients also have giant cell arteritis. The cause is unknown, although studies showing a cyclical incidence have led to theories regarding an infectious trigger. Diagnosis of PMR can prove difficult, and other inflammatory conditions should be excluded. Patients are usually over 60 years, and PMR is very rarely seen in the under 50s. Bronchial carcinoma can cause hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, which shares some of the features of PMR, but is not a classic association. Investigations typically reveal:  Normochromic / normocytic anaemia Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) often greater than 50 mm/hr (although this may be normal) Raised C reactive protein (CRP), and Raised creatine phosphokinase would suggest polymyositis rather than polymyalgia rheumatica.  Features of giant cell arteritis should be sought:  Headache Visual disturbance Jaw claudication Thickened and tender temporal arteries.  Response to a moderate dose of steroids can be useful in confirming the diagnosis of PMR. The maximum dose of prednisolone should not exceed 20 mg once daily. Patients should report 70% improvement in symptoms within three to four weeks, and inflammatory markers should have normalised by this point. In general, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have little use and are associated with significant morbidity. There is little evidence for the use of steroid-sparing agents. "
immune system,41,A 73-year-old male presented with an acute attack of gout in his left knee. Which of the following is the most likely underlying metabolic cause?,Decreased renal excretion of uric acid,Endogenous overproduction of uric acid,Excessive dietary purine intake,Lactic acidosis,Starvation,A,"Gout is the most prevalent form of inflammatory arthropathy. It is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals with resultant inflammation in the involved joint. Serum urate concentrations exceeding 7 mg/dl are associated with increased risk of gout. The aetiology of gout can broadly be divided into cases where there is:  underexcretion of uric acid via the kidney (90%), or endogenous overproduction of uric acid (10%),  although in practical terms the distinction is rarely made as allopurinol is the mainstay of long term treatment (not during the acute attack) in both groups. Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism. Its production and excretion are tightly regulated and, in normal circumstances, uric acid excretion is two thirds renal and one third via intestinal bacterial uricolysis. Where renal elimination is impaired, the amount of extra-renal excretion can be increased. In a 73-year-old man, it is almost certainly reduced renal excretion due to deteriorating renal function and possibly diuretic use. Excessive dietary intake of purines is rarely a cause of sustained hyperuricaemia, although patients should be advised to follow a low purine diet to reduce the risk of recurrent attacks. Starvation leads to an increase in lactic acid, which impairs the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid and therefore increases the risk of developing gout. This is however a rare underlying cause, and decreased renal excretion is more likely in this case. Gout can also be caused by inborn errors of metabolism which alter uric acid homeostatis. These are mainly inherited enzyme defects, and present in younger patients. As a final point, it is also important to note that gout appears to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, additional to the risk conferred by its association with more traditional risk factors.

Which is the next appropriate investigation?,Bronchoscopy,CT scan of chest,Interferon-gamma releasing assay,Sputum for AFB examination,Sputum for M/Candamp;S,E,"Mycobacterium avium is an opportunistic mycobacterium, which is a ubiquitous environmental organism acquired by person-to-person spread. In immunocompetent patients, such as this gentleman, M.avium can cause pulmonary infection in one of two patterns:  disease resembling tuberculosis, often in elderly smokers with chronic lung disease, or nodular infiltrates and a bronchiectasis-like pattern in those without chronic lung disease, with a productive cough but no systemic symptoms  Investigation in the immunocompetent is initially with sputum AFB staining, which is positive in most cases. Sputum culture should be done, but it does not differentiate between infection and colonisation. More than one positive culture is required for diagnosis for this reason. Chest radiograph can show cavitating changes, nodules, and parenchymal involvement, particularly in the middle and upper lobes, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. CT is usually required following multiple positive sputum cultures, to prove pathogenic changes in the lungs. If there is still a query over whether changes merely represent colonisation, transbronchial or CT-guided biopsy can be carried out. Treatment is with a combination of two or three antibiotics for at least 12 months. The exact combination depends on local guidelines."

Which of the following immunological investigations is the most specific for this lady's condition?",Anticentromere antibody ,Anti-ds DNA antibody,Antitopoisomerase I (Scl-70) antibody,Rheumatoid factor,Topoisomerase I ,C,"This lady has systemic sclerosis as suggested by the:  dyspnoea (lung fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension) dysphagia (oesophageal involvement) and Raynaud's.  Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by increased fibroblast activity and fibrosis in a number of different organ systems. Ninety to 95% of patients have positive antinuclear antibodies. There are two major subtypes:  limited cutaneous, and diffuse cutaneous.  CREST syndrome is an older term for the limited cutaneous form (calcinosis, Raynauds' phenomenon, eosophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia). Patients with systemic sclerosis can present with skin abnormalities, musculoskeletal changes, gastrointestinal complications, pulmonary disease, renal crisis, and dry eyes and mouth. A number of autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens can be detected in patients with systemic sclerosis. Anti-centromere antibodies and anti-topoisomerase I antibodies are the classic autoantibodies associated with the disease. Anti-centromere antibodies are linked with limited cutaneous involvement and isolated pulmonary hypertension, and a good prognosis, whereas anti-topoisomerase I are linked with diffuse skin disease and pulmonary fibrosis and a higher mortality. Respiratory symptoms are common in patients with systemic sclerosis, but it is often difficult to distinguish between interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension as the cause. Echocardiography, pulmonary hypertension, and chest radiographs or CT are often required. Inspiratory crackles heard here make interstitial lung disease the most likely diagnosis, but it is important to note they are not always present in the early stages of disease. Signs of pulmonary hypertension are jugular venous distension, right ventricular heave, and an accentuated pulmonary second heart sound. Anti-ds DNA antibodies are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Rheumatoid factor is non-specific, but is associated with rheumatoid arthritis. Topoisomerase III is not an investigation which is routinely used. "

Which of the following HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genes are not expressed by cells of the trophoblast?,HLA-E and HLA G,HLA-A and HLA-B,HLA-B and HLA-E,HLA-D and HLA-E,HLA-B and HLA-C,B,"Human trophoblast cells do not express the two main polymorphic classical class Ia antigens HLA-A and B Reproductive Immunology Immune Tolerance in PregnancyThe fetus can be considered an allograft with antigenically different material to the mother. A number of mechanisms therefore need to be in place to prevent 'graft rejection' in the form of the mother mounting an immune response against the foetus. The placenta plays a key role herePlacentaImmunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an immunologically privileged site i.e. able to tolerate foreign antigens without provocation of immune response. A number of mechanisms help achieve this:1. MHC (HLA complex) Antigen ExpressionIt has been shown that differences between class 1 and class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens are the basis for transplant rejection. In Trophoblast cells MHC class II antigens are not presented. HLA genes can be classes as 1a (HLA-A, -B, and -C) or 1b (HLA-E, -F, and -G) In trophoblast cells only HLA-C is expressed from the 1a group along with all three types of 1b genes. It has been shown that HLA-G in particular has several roles in immune suppression such as reduction of NK cell killing activity, reduction of IFN-y production, regulation of cytokine production and suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing activity and T-helper activity.2. Complement Protein InhibitionDAF, MCP and CD59 are proteins expressed by the placenta that inhibit complement proteins. Complement is an important part of the immune system in graft rejections.3.T-cells/T-helper cellsChanges to both the cell populations occur during pregnancy. Increased T regulatory cell (TREG cell) populations occur in pregnancy. These cells can both up and down regulate various immune responses. Th2 levels increase during pregnancy Th1 levels decrease during pregnancy4. PhosphocholinationThe addition of the phosphocholine molecule to glycoproteins inhibits T and B lymphocyte responses. It is a mechanism used by some parasites5. PDL1Cell signalling molecule that down regulates T-cell response6. ProgesteroneThought to play a role in immune suppression by stimulating lymphocytes to produce a blocking factor that mediates cytokine production.Other mechanismsPlacental exosomes, retroviral envelope proteins and CRH may all play a role in maternal immune tolerance but this level of detail is unlikely to be required by the MRCOG"

immune system,65,"A 36-year-old woman presents with an acutely painful red eye and painful lumpy red-blue lesions on her shin. On enquiry she gives a history of recurrent episodes of oral and genital ulcers in the last year. Some of these ulcers have been scarring. Recent blood tests show a normocytic normochromic anaemia, normal LFTs, UEandamp;C, and a raised ESR of 56 mm/hr. What is the diagnosis?",Behçet's disease,Reactive arthritis,Sarcoidosis,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,Systemic lupus erythematosus,A,"This patient has Behçet's disease. This is a clinical diagnosis. Recurrent scarring oro-genital ulcers are pathognomonic of Behçet's disease. Recurrent oral ulcers occur in SLE but they are generally non-scarring. Reactive arthritis and sarcoidosis do not associate with recurrent scarring oro-genital ulcers. Uveitis does not occur in Steven-Johnson's syndrome. The International Study Group criteria for classification of Behçet's disease require the presence of recurrent oral ulceration (minor aphthous, major aphthous or herpetiform ulceration observed by physician or patient, which have recurred at least three times in a 12 month period), and two of the following:  Recurrent genital ulceration - aphthous ulceration or scarring, observed by physician or patient Eye lesions - anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, or cells in vitreous on slit lamp examination; or retinal vasculitis observed by ophthalmologist Skin lesions - erythema nodosum observed by physician or patient, pseudofolliculitis or papulopustular lesions; or acneiform nodules observed by the physician in post-adolescent patients not on corticosteroid treatment Positive pathergy test - read by physician at 24-48 hours.  Pathergy is the non-specific hyperreactivity of the skin following minor trauma, and is specific to Behçet's disease. It involves intradermal injection of skin with a 20-gauge needle under sterile conditions. It is considered positive if an erythematous sterile papule develops within 48 hours."

immune system,70,"A 66-year-old man has a painful, swollen right knee and difficulty in walking which he has had for three days. He had two self-limiting episodes of severe pain and swelling in the right big toe in the last year. A knee aspirate shows no organisms on Gram stain, plenty of leucocytes, and negatively birefringent crystals on polarised light microscopy. Recent blood tests show a normal renal function, and a raised serum urate 452 µmol/l (210-415). Once the acute attack of gout has subsided, which of the following is the most appropriate drug in his long term management ?",Allopurinol,Corticosteroids,Dietary advice,Febuxostat,Ibuprofen,A,"Gout is the most prevalent form of inflammatory arthropathy. It is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals with resultant inflammation in the involved joint. Allopurinol is indicated in those with  More than two episodes of acute gout in a year Tophaceous gout Uric acid stones or Renal insufficiency.  Starting treatment with allopurinol leads to changes in serum uric acid levels, which can mobilise intra-articular urate crystals, thereby triggering episodes of acute gout. In order to prevent these attacks of gout, patients starting allopurinol (or other urate lowering therapy) should be co-prescribed colchicine 500 microgram bd for six months. If there are contraindications to colchicine, or if it is not well tolerated, they should be commenced on NSAIDs/COX 2 inhibitors for a period of six weeks. The duration of treatment with NSAIDs/COX 2 inhibitors is shorter due to a higher risk of side effects than with colchicine. However, individual patients may require a longer course of treatment. Febuxostat is a non-purine selective inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. It is recommended in cases of allopurinol hypersensitivity or intolerance. Oral, intramuscular or intra-articular corticosteroids are effective in the control of acute gout. Prolonged corticosteroid use has significant side effects and is not indicated in the long term management of gout. Similarly, ibuprofen may be used to treat acute gout, but has no role in the long term management of gout."

There is no personal or family history of chronic skin diseases and he drinks alcohol occasionally. On examination there is a right knee effusion, and the knee aspirate shows plenty of leucocytes, no crystals, and no organisms on Gram stain or culture. What is the next step in his management?",Commence disease modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD),Intra-articular corticosteroids,Oral antibiotics for five days,Oral antibiotics for six weeks,Oral NSAIDs,E,"Reactive arthritis is the classic triad of conjunctivitis, urethritis and arthritis which occurs one to three months after an initiating infection. It commonly occurs following:  Urethritis (C. trachomatis) Diarrhoea (C. jejuni, Salmonella species), or Upper respiratory tract infections (β-haemolytic Streptococcus).  Dermatological manifestations are common, including keratoderma blennorhagicum, circinate balanitis, nail changes and oral lesions. It is more common in men, and the pathophysiology is not yet fully understood. In the acute phase, affected joints should be rested and effusions aspirated. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents are first line treatment. Corticosteroids can be given either intra-articular or systemic, particular in patients who are unresponsive to NSAIDs or who develop adverse effects. Antibiotics do not change the course of reactive arthritis, even when an infective cause is identified. However, some studies show that they may help to reduce the length of arthritis, particularly if Chlamydia is the triggering infection. Evidence for the use of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs in reactive arthritis is limited. Sulfasalazine can be beneficial in resistant disease, and TNF alpha-blockers can be used in aggressive disease. Typically reactive arthritis is self-limiting with resolution of symptoms within three to 12 months. However, 15% of patients develop a long term arthritis, enthesitis or spondylitis. There is a high incidence of recurrence, especially in patients who are HLA-B27 positive (triggered by infection or stress). "
immune system,77,An 81-year-old female presents with bilaterally painful knees. There was no history of gastrointestinal diseases. On examination she had crepitus but had a full range of movement of both knees. Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for her painful knees?,Celecoxib,Dihydrocodeine,Naproxen,Paracetamol,Topical diclofenac,D,"This woman has osteoarthritis (OA) of the knees. The principal goal of systemic therapy is to provide the most effective pain relief with the least associated toxicity. Paracetamol is the initial therapy recommended for the treatment of OA of the hip and knee. Studies have shown that the short term and long term efficacy of paracetamol is comparable with that of ibuprofen and naproxen in people with knee osteoarthritis. Topical non-steroidals (such as diclofenac) are usually second-line, and are used in conjunction with paracetamol.  Specific COX-2 inhibitors such as celecoxib have clinical benefit similar to that of traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but less gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity although issues remain regarding their cardiovascular risk. They may be used in patients with GI intolerance of traditional NSAIDs."

It can also be related to streptococcal infections, acute sarcoidosis or related to drugs such as the oral contraceptive pill, sulphonamides and penicillins. Rarer causes include inflammatory bowel disease, tuberculosis, Behçet's disease and other connective tissue disorders. In this case, a chest x ray would be the most helpful investigation as this may identify bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy which together with a bilateral ankle arthropathy would strongly support a diagnosis of acute sarcoidosis.

immune system,85,"A 45-year-old man presents with a six month history of gradually worsening right knee pain, swelling, and restricted movements. There is no history of injury, or recent infections. He does not take any long term medications, and there is no significant past or family history of note. On examination, the knee is grossly swollen, warm, non-tender, and there is restricted flexion and extension. The synovial fluid aspirated is brown stained. What is the diagnosis?",Acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout),Gout,Meniscal tear,Pigmented villonodular synovitis,Reactive arthritis,D,"The following are differential diagnoses of arthropathies associated with iron deposition in the joints:  Haemophilia Haemosiderosis from recurrent haemarthrosis Haemochromatosis, and Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS).  They can therefore lead to brown-stained synovial fluid. Calcium pyrophosphate crystal arthritis (pseudogout), typically occurs in elderly patients who have a history of osteoarthritis. It presents with acute onset of joint swelling and pain. This patient also has no risk factors for gout (young age, no history of excessive alcohol intake), meniscal tears (no injury), or reactive arthritis (no preceding infections). PVNS is a rare proliferative disorder that affects the synovium in young and middle aged adults. Current thinking is that it is an inflammatory process, although some believe it is a benign neoplasm. Monoarticular involvement, the most common manifestation, occurs in two forms: localised and diffuse. The localised form is characterised by focal synovial involvement, with either nodular or pedunculated masses. The diffuse form, in contrast, affects virtually the entire synovium. Although any joint can be involved, the knee is the most common. Symptoms are usually non-specific (pain, warmth, swelling). On examination there is tenderness, effusion and restricted joint mobility. Radiographs are often unremarkable, but MRI can show intra-articular masses with signal dropout on T2 weighted images. Joint aspiration yields xanthochromic or serosanguineous fluid. The optimal treatment of PVNS is surgery. The local recurrence after marginal excision for localised disease is low. However, recurrence after open synovectomy for diffuse PVNS is relatively high (up to 46%, higher with arthroscopic resection). Synovectomy, in addition to disease control, can prevent secondary osteoarthritis. Complications include arthrofibrosis and wound breakdown. Intra-articular radioactive isotopes or external beam radiotherapy may be benefical anjuvant therapy for extensive diffuse and recurrent PVNS. In some patients total joint arthroscopy may be the only effective treatment. PVNS can be aggressive, with marked extra-articular extension. "
immune system,86,A 45-year-old man has noted pain in his right knee for several years. There is no joint swelling or history of trauma. He states that the pain gets better on movement but recently it has changed and exercise is now exacerbating the pain. He reports no weight loss or signifcant history of fractures. He is a non-smoker and non-drinker and has no family history of bone disease. The underlying disease process is probably which of the following?,Osteoarthritis,Osteochondroma,Osteomalacia,Osteopetrosis,Osteoporosis,A,"Osteoarthritis is one of the most common joint diseases, and its incidence is increasing with the age and weight of the population. It presents with pain, commonly affecting the knees, hips and small joints of the hand. Pathogenesis involves the localised loss of cartilage, with remodelling of adjacent bone. The associated pain is exacerbated by exercise and relieved by rest, although in advanced disease rest and night pain can develop. There may also be joint stiffness, typically in the morning or after rest. This stiffness wears off with movement, which can lead to less discomfort during the day (as is described here). Diagnosis is often late, and treatment is usually aimed at reducing pain and improving function rather than targeting the disease process. The symptoms of pain are very variable and can either be relieved or exacerbated by exercise. Osteoporosis is characterised by progressive deterioration of bone micro-architecture, with associated decrease in bone mineral density. It is typically asyptomatic until the complicated by fracture when pain is exacerbated by movement. Osteochondroma is a benign tumour of cartilage, which can be located about the knee. However, they commonly present in adolescence as a painless lump which grows with the bone. Pain is not a predominant symptom. Osteomalacia is caused by a deficiency of vitamin D and presents with widespread bone pain and tenderness (especially lower back and hips), muscle weakness and lethargy, Osteopetrosis, an uncommon inherited metabolic disorder, leads to 'brittle bones' that predispose to fractures. Isolated joint pain is not typically an associated feature. This question tests your understanding of disease prevalence, and the relative importance of certain symptoms and signs in differentiating disease. It is really important to realise that patients rarely present with the classical textbook descriptions of symptoms, in either the exam or clinical practice. From the options given above osteoarthritis is the most likely diagnosis. "

immune system,90,A 65 year old gentleman with rheumatoid arthritis presents with difficulty moving his right shoulder. He is complaining of a dull ache of his shoulder. On examination he is unable to actively abduct his arm however once abduction is initiated passively he can keep his arm elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Rheumatoid arthritis,Torn rotator cuff,Adhesive capsulitis,Osteoarthritis,Rotator cuff tendonitis,B,This history is indicative of a torn rotator cuff. This leads to difficulty in actively abducting arm but once passively moved the arm can remain elevated due to the action of the deltoid. It can occur following trauma and spontaneously in the elderly or in rheumatoid arthritis. You would expect pain to predominate in rotator cuff tendonitis and adhesive capsulitis.

Cultures are taken and she is commenced on intravenous tazobactam/piperacillin and gentamicin. Five days later her fever is still persisting and a chest x ray reveals patchy infiltrates throughout both lung fields. Their oxygen saturations do not drop on exertion. Which of the following is the likeliest diagnosis?,Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia,Influenza,Invasive aspergillosis,PCP,Pulmonary TB,C,"The presence of interstitial infiltrates would make PCP a possibility. In practice, however, it does not often result in clinically significant infection in patients with neutropenia. The patients it does effect are those who have had bone marrow transplants or those with HIV: it seems a lack of cell-mediated immunity is what results in symptomatic infection. On the other hand, fungal infections are relatively common in patients with neutropenia (especially in those who the neutropenia lasts for more than 10 days or who are on corticosteroids). Most neutropenic sepsis protocols recommend the addition of anti-fungal agents if patients remain febrile or unwell after 72 hours of empirical antibiotic treatment. Tazocin would cover for hospital-acquired pneumonia, and it would be unusual for influenza to give these radiographic appearances in this situation. We are not told of any TB risk factors, and this would be less likely than aspergillosis."

Other manifestations of reactive arthritis include:  Psoriasiform skin Nail and mucosal lesions Keratoderma blenorrhagica (palmoplantar pustulosis), and Circinate balanitis.  Behcet's disease is unlikely as there are no orogenital ulcers. Genital ulceration in Behcet's disease affects the scrotum in men and labia in women. Peripheral arthropathy in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is oligoarticular, asymmetric, and predominantly involves the lower limbs. The lack of a history of diarrhoea and presence of urethritis, makes IBD unlikely. Sarcoidosis leads to ankle and ocular involvement but does not lead to urethritis. Similarly, Whipple's disease manifests as:  Polyarticular symmetrical arthropathy Diarrhoea Weight loss Lymphadenopathy, and Fever.  Whipple's disease does not lead to urethritis."
immune system,93,A 34 year old male presents with left neck and shoulder pain. He also notices a tingling sensation in his left forearm which is particularly noticeable on carrying his briefcase or shopping bags. He also complains of his left hand turning cold and white on occasion. On examination there is evidence of wasting in his thenar muscle and sensory loss over the ulnar aspect of the forearm. There is pallor of his left arm when elevated and loss of his left radial pulse on abduction and external rotation of his left shoulder. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Brachial Neuritis,Cervical Radiculopathy,Cervical Spondylosis,Frozen Shoulder,Thoracic Outlet Syndrome,E,"The signs and symptoms are highly indicative of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. There is evidence of sensory loss in T1, unilateral Raynaud's phenomenon and ADSON's sign positive (loss of radial pulse on abduction and external rotation). In thoracic outlet syndrome there may be compression of the brachial plexus, subclavian artery and/or vein by structures such as a cervical rib or tight fibrous band and therefore there may be evidence of neurological and/or vascular symptoms and signs. In cervical radiculopathy sensory loss is unlikely to be evident and the vascular symptoms and signs are not observed."

immune system,97,A 67-year-old woman with a long history of rheumatoid arthritis comes to the clinic for review. Her rheumatoid is poorly controlled and she is receiving regular doses of methotrexate and low dose prednisolone. Most recently she has begun to suffer from increasing pitting oedema. On examination her BP is 145/84 mmHg and her pulse is 85. She has pitting oedema to the mid shin. Investigations show    Haemoglobin 110 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 8.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 159 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 140 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 130 μmol/L (79-118)   Serum albumin 24 g/L (36-50)   Urine Protein ++    Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation likely to elucidate the underlying diagnosis?,Liver biopsy,Rectal biopsy,Renal biopsy,Renal ultrasound scan,Skin biopsy,B,"This patient has poorly controlled rheumatoid arthritis and her proteinuria and hypoalbuminaemia raises the possibility of systemic amyloidosis. Secondary amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis is an important complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It is caused by extracellular accumulation of AA fibrils, derived from the acute-phase-reactant serum amyloid A protein, within various tissues and organs. It is a significant cause of increased morbidity and early death in RA. Studies have shown that deposits of AA fibrils are not uncommon in RA (~20%). Any patient with longstanding RA who develops proteinuria, or intractable diarrhoea, should be investigated for AA amyloidosis. No blood test is diagnostic for amyloidosis. Diagnosis therefore requires a biopsy and histological examination. In order to start treatment as early as possible, a high-sensitivity site with a safe technique should be chosen. Subcutanous fat, spleen, adrenal, liver, labia, salivary gland and gastrointestinal tract are frequent sites of AA amyloid deposition. Non-invasive techniques, such as renal ultrasound, can be useful in assessing organ involvement, but cannot establish whether the findings are definitely related to amyloid. Gastrointestinal (GI), rectal and subcutaneous fat biopsies are the procedures of choice. The amount of amyloid in fat is low, and therefore it is not used routinely in the UK. GI and rectal are recommended because their sensitivities are high and they can be performed as an outpatient procedure. The incidence correlates strongly with renal biopsy, but the procedure is associated with much lower risk. The progression of amyloidosis associated with systemic inflammatory disorders is slowed by better control of the underlying condition; as such in this case she should be sent for rheumatology review to determine the most appropriate way to step up her rheumatoid arthritis therapy.

Clinical examination of her hands demonstrates nail fold infarcts and telangiectasia on fingers which appear to taper distally. Dilated nailfold capillary loops without capillary drop out were apparent on nailfold capillaroscopy. Which of the following is most commonly associated with this condition?",Anti-Mi-2,Anti-Ro,Anti-smooth muscle,Anti-topoisomerase I (Scl-70),HLA DR1 (DQ5),D,"Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by increased fibroblast activity and fibrosis in a number of different organ systems. Ninety to 95% of patients have positive antinuclear antibodies. There are two major subtypes: limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous. CREST syndrome is an older term for the limited cutaneous form (calcinosis, Raynauds' phenomenon, oeosophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia). Patients with systemic sclerosis can present with:  Skin abnormalities Musculoskeletal changes Gastrointestinal complications Pulmonary disease Renal crisis, and Dry eyes and mouth.  A number of autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens can be detected in patients with systemic sclerosis. Anticentromere antibodies and antitopoisomerase I antibodies are the classic autoantibodies associated with the disease. Anticentromere antibodies are linked with limited cutaneous involvement and isolated pulmonary hypertension, and a good prognosis, whereas antitopoisomerase I and linked with diffuse skin disease and pulmonary fibrosis and a higher mortality. Additional autoantibodies which can be detected are anti-RNA polymerase, anti-U3RNP, anti-Ku and anti-U1RNP. Antibodies to Ro are also detected in systemic sclerosis. Patients in whom they are found tend to have earlier pulmonary involvement as compared to those patients who do not have anti-Ro antibodies. However, these antibodies are non-specific and are also present in patients with systemic lupus erythematous (where they are associated with neonatal lupus) and myositis. Anti-Mi-2 antibodies are associated with inflammatory myopathies. Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are linked with autoimmune hepatitis.  The haplotypes HLA-B8, DR5, DR3, DR52 and DQB2 have been linked with systemic sclerosis. HLA DRB1*01 and DQB1*0501 haplotypes are more common in anticentromere antibody positive patients, while HLA DRB1*11 and DQB1*0301 have been associated with antitopoisomerase I antibodies. "

immune system,101,"A 72-year-old lady presents with pain and swelling of the left wrist. Three weeks ago she received an intra-articular steroid injection into the wrist as treatment of chronic pain which was thought to be due to osteoarthritis.

Results reveal:    White cell count 12.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Rheumatoid factor 34 U/L (less than20)    x Ray of wrist revealed a bony destruction of the joint and wrist aspiration revealed only a dry tap. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute gout,Acute inflammatory reaction related to osteoarthritis,Acute rheumatoid arthritis,Pyrophosphate arthropathy,Septic arthiritis,E,"Septic arthritis is a potential catastrophic complication of intra-articular steroid injection, although it is rare. In general there is wide variation in the precautions taken to avoid such a complication. Fluid should be aspirated for urgent Gram-stain and antibiotics started immediately (choice depends on local policy). Small joints such the wrist can be very difficult to aspirate, and possible cases should be discussed with the orthopaedic surgeons as soon as possible. Gout presents with acute onset of pain, classically in the first metatarsophalyngeal joint of the foot, due to monosodium urate crystal deposition. It is more common in men than women. Pseudogout more commonly complicates osteoarthritis, and results from calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition. The knee is affected more often than the wrist, and in the context of recent instrumentation it is critical septic arthritis is excluded. A flare of osteoarthritis is a possibility but septic arthritis needs to be excluded before making this diagnosis. Whilst a septic arthritis usually develops within 3-4 days of intra-articular injections presentation can be delayed. Not all septic arthritis cause a systemic inflammatory response, and the absence of 'sepsis' does not exclude the diagnosis. In a lady of this age, with no other features and a known diagnosis of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis is unlikely. The positive rheumatoid factor is a red herring, it is mildly positive here and is found in 2.5% of the population and may be raised in association with malignancy, systemic lupus erythematosus and infection.

immune system,105,"A 42-year-old woman who has recently returned from a holiday to Spain presents to the clinic with thirst, polyuria and a rash affecting both shins. Her only past medical history of note is mild asthma diagnosed by her GP, but she tells you the inhaler he prescribed has made no difference to her symptoms. On examination, her BP is 135/85, pulse is 75 and regular. There are small palpable lymph nodes on palpation of the neck and axillae. Her chest is clear on auscultation, and her abdomen is soft and non-tender with a BMI of 29. There is a raised red/purple rash on both shins.

The clues here include the non-responsiveness of chest symptoms to the salbutamol inhaler, erythema nodosum, non-specific elevation in inflammatory markers, and hypercalcaemia. Patients with sarcoid frequently present with symptoms of hypercalcaemia after a holiday because increased sun exposure results in increased production of vitamin D. A chest radiograph, not reported here, may show a variety of abnormalities, including bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The mainstay of treatment of sarcoidosis is with oral corticosteroids, but patients with mild symptoms can be managed with surveillance alone.  None of the other options listed commonly causes hypercalcaemia, and the inflammatory markers are only mildly elevated, reducing the probability of her symptoms being due to a chronic infection such as tuberculosis. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is associated with symptoms of sinusitis due to granuloma formation, and EGPA would explain the asthma-like symptoms but not the others."
immune system,106,"A 35-year-old woman presents with malaise, thirst, and increasing nocturia over the last month. Six months ago she attended the Emergency Department with an episode of renal colic. One month previously her GP had noted an eruptive, painful, erythematous rash on the anterior shins, which was self-limiting. Which of the following is the likely cause of her symptoms?",Hypercalcaemia ,Hyperglycaemia ,Hyperoxaluria ,Hypocalcaemia ,Hypokalaemia ,A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder. It is relatively uncommon in the United Kingdom as a whole, but is more prevalent and more severe in Afro-Caribbean populations. Onset of symptoms is typically in adults around 20-40-years-old. Features of sarcoidosis include:  Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy Hypercalcaemia, which may be sensitive to steroids Erythema nodosum Neurological sequelae including neuropathy and Bell's palsy Cardiomyopathy Eye inflammation: uveitis and conjunctivitis, and Hepatosplenomegaly.  Hypercalcaemia has a varied presentation. At levels less than 2.8 mmol/L polyuria, polydipsia, dyspepsia, depression and mild cognitive impairment predominate. At levels up to 3.5 mmol/L patients present with muscle weakness, constipation, anorexia, nausea, and fatigue. Above this level, patients develop vomiting, dehydration, cardiac arrhythmias, coma, and pancreatitis. Hyperglycaemia can cause thirst, nocturia and malaise but is not commonly associated with renal colic, or erythema nodosum. Hypocalcaemia leads to paraesthesia, tetany, carpopedal spasm, and muscle cramps. Hypokalaemia is generally asymptomatic, but severe deficiency can cause muscle weakness, paraesthesia, and tetany. Hyperoxaluria can be either primary or secondary, and is normally asymptomatic until nephrolithiasis develops."

A lumbar spine and pelvic radiograph done by his GP is reported as normal. Blood tests show a normal FBC, UEC and liver function tests. The CRP is 23 mg/L and the ESR is 32 mm/hr. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ankylosing spondylitis,Discitis,Mechanical back pain,Osteoarthritis,Spondylolisthesis,A,"The combination of lower back pain and stiffness makes ankylosing spondylitis (AS) the most likely diagnosis in this scenario. Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronic, potentially disabling, form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy which primarily involves the axial skeleton. The aetiology is not clearly understood, but it involves the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The pathology mainly affects the entheses, where ligaments, tendons and capsules are attached to the bone. Current British Society for Rheumatology recommendations state that the modified New York criteria should be used to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis: Clinical criteria:  Low back pain, present for more than three months, improved by exercise but not relieved by rest Limitation of lumbar spine motion in both the sagittal and frontal planes Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values for age and sex  Radiological criteria:  Sacroiliitis on x ray  Diagnose:  Definite AS if the radiological criterion is present plus at least one clinical criterion Probable AS if three clinical criteria are present alone or if the radiological criterion is present but no clinicial criteria are present.  It is widely accepted that making the diagnosis early is difficult because the onset is insidious, and there is no definitive diagnostic test. One study has stated that the average time from onset to diagnosis ranges from three to 11 years. Timely diagnosis therefore requires a high index of suspicion. HLA-B27 is found in 90% patients with AS but also 8% of the general population and therefore should not be relied upon in making a diagnosis. MRI can visualise sacroiliitis in patients with typical symptoms of AS but normal radiographs and it is evolving as the most important diagnostic imaging tool in early disease.  However, as yet a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis cannot be made on MRI findings alone and these cases are currently termed non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). Both HLA-B27 and sacroiliitis on MRI play a major role in the recently proposed Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) diagnostic algorithm. This may replace the modified New York criteria in the future. An x ray of the lumbar spine may show bridging syndesmophytes between the vertebral bodies in keeping with ankylosing spondylitis but this is not part of the diagnostic criteria, and it is a late sign. Radiographic sacroiliitis is a requirement for patients to be eligible for anti-TNF treatment for AS. The sacroiliitis is usually bilateral and symmetrical. It progresses from blurring of the subchondral bone plate to irregular erosions of the margins of the sacroiliac joints to sclerosis, narrowing, and finally fusion. Erosions of the sacroiliac joint are generally seen earlier in the lower portion due to its synovial lining, and on the iliac side due to the thinner cartilage covering this side of the joint. Discitis is inflammation of the vertebral disc space, often related to infection. It typically presents with an insidious onset of pain and localised tenderness, which is worsens with activity (unlike the stiffness described here). Mechanical back pain and osteoarthritis pain also improve with NSAIDs. However, they cause low back pain that is worse with activity, and relieved with rest. Spondylolisthesis is the movement of one vertebra due to instability. It presents with pain which is worse with activity, and may be associated with nerve root compression. "

What is the next step in his long term management?",Alternative NSAID,Anti-TNF α agents,Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs),Intra-articular corticosteroids,Oral corticosteroids,C,"This patient has psoriatic arthritis and should be treated with a DMARD to prevent joint damage from proliferative/erosive changes in psoriatic arthritis. In the United Kingdom, anti-TNF agents are used for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis only if the patient fails to respond to an adequate trial of two DMARDs (for example, leflunomide, methotrexate, sulfasalazine). Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to exacerbate psoriatic skin lesions in certain situations, and is therefore used with caution if at all. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) provide partial symptom relief and do not prevent progressive joint damage. In patients with cutaneous psoriasis, systemic corticosteroids predispose to pustular psoriasis, and may result in a flare of skin psoriasis when they are stopped. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may be considered for symptom control during a mono- or oligo-articular flare of psoriatic arthritis.

When should he next be screened?,Two weeks,One month,Three months,Six months,One year,C,"Current United Kingdom guidance suggests that during the first three months of treatment with sulfasalazine, full blood count (FBC) should be monitored monthly for the first three months. Sulphasalazine should be withheld until discussion with the specialist team if:  the white cell count is less than 3.5 neutrophils is less than 2, or platelets are less than 150.  If mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is more than 105 fl, vitamin B12, folate and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should be checked and treated if found to be abnormal. If these are all normal it should be discussed with the specialist team. If counts remain normal within the first three months, full blood count can be checked three monthly. Liver function tests (LFTs) should also be checked monthly for the first three months. If either the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are more than twice the upper limit of normal sulfasalazine should be withheld until discussion with the specialist team. If the LFTs remain normal for the first three months, monitoring can be decreased to three monthly. If, following the first year, the dose has not been increased and blood results have been stable, the frequency of monitoring can be reduced to every six months for the second year of treatment. Thereafter monitoring is not required, although FBC and LFTs should be checked one month after any dose increase. Side effects of sulfasalazine include myelosuppression, macrocytosis, hypersensitivity and azoospermia in males. There are numerous signs of sulfasalazine toxicity. Rash and oral ulceration should be asked about and, if severe, the drug should be withheld until specialist advice has been sought. Nausea, dizziness and headache can be common and sometimes necessitate dose reduction.

As the cells mature, they pass to the thymic medulla, where they lose expression of either CD4 or CD8, to become single positive cells. Negative selection occurs at the stage when thymocytes express both CD4 and CD8, but co-expression of these markers does not mediate negative selection. Negative selection occurs when a thymocyte expresses a TcR with high affinity for self antigen:MHC complexes in the thymic micro-environment. Once a thymocyte has successfully rearranged and expressed an alpha/beta or gamma/delta TcR it is committed to that lineage. Thymocytes whose TcR bind with high affinity to self Ag/MHC complexes are clonally deleted by a process of negative selection. B cells express IgM and IgD; T cells do not."

immune system,134,"A 25-year-old man complaining of low back pain and stiffness gradually increasing in severity for six months presents to the outpatient department. He has no past medical history and the only medications he takes are anti-inflammatories that ease the pain. On examination, his back movements are stiff with decreased range of movement due to pain, but the spine curvature is normal. Which one of the options below is the most likely diagnosis?",Ankylosing spondylitis (AS),Metastatic disease of the spine,Muscular strain,Reactive arthritis,Scheuermann's disease,A,"All of these can be causes of back pain. The key differentiators in this case are the age of the patient and the detailed history of the type of back pain. Patients often present with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in their 20s and 30s with a history of chronic back pain and stiffness. Key features of the pain include:  Early morning stiffness of more than 30 minutes Alternating buttock pain Waking in the second half of the night Pain easing with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) Pain which is worse with rest and eases with exercise  In the advanced stages of AS, patients develop loss of lumbar lordosis, buttock atrophy and an exaggerated thoracic kyphosis. This results in a posture commonly referred to as 'question mark'. Metastatic cancer can affect the spine and cause back pain. This is usually associated with 'red flag' signs suggesting malignancy. This diagnosis is less common in younger patients. Muscular strain is the commonest cause of back pain in general practice but chronic pain for more than three months may indicate AS and should be investigated. Reactive arthritis can cause inflammatory back pain with similar symptoms to AS but there is no history of preceding genitourinary or gastrointestinal infection. Scheuermann's disease generally presents in teenagers with thoracic back pain and increased thoracic kyphosis, and therefore does not fit with this scenario."
immune system,135,You are seeing a patient with rheumatoid arthritis in clinic. You are keen to commence methotrexate.

There have been cases of fatal blood dyscrasias with bleeding and severe bone marrow suppression, putting patients at risk of severe infection. Liver cirrhosis and toxicity are other possible complications. These toxic effects can be reduced by the concurrent use of folic acid (except on the day of taking the methotrexate). Methotrexate can also cause lung fibrosis. Patients are therefore advised to seek medical advice if they have sore throat and illness, easy bruising or bleeding, shortness of breath, abdominal pain and vomiting or jaundice. It should be documented in patient notes that this advice has been given. The current recommendation is that FBC, Uandamp;Es and LFTs are checked at baseline and then two-weekly until the dose and monitoring is stable for 6 weeks. These should then be checked monthly until the dose and disease is stable for a year. After this monitoring can be reduced to every two to three months if advised by a specialist.  Methotrexate should be stopped immediately if there is a clinically significant drop in white cell count or platelet count. If there is derangement of LFTs it should also be stopped, but may be reintroduced after a couple of weeks if the LFTs normalise, but only under specialist advice."
immune system,136,"An 84-year-old woman is referred to the rheumatology clinic for review. She has been suffering from arthritis affecting her right hip managed with analgesics by her GP for the past year.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Osteoarthritis,Osteomalacia,Osteoporosis,Paget's disease,Primary hyperparathyroidism,D,"The answer is Paget's disease. Monoarticular Paget's disease is relatively common, and is characterised by extensive joint destruction with normal serum calcium and elevated alkaline phosphatase. Diagnosis is a clinical one based on x ray findings and elevation in alkaline phosphatase in the absence of other abnormal biochemistry. Bisphosphonates are the mainstay of therapy with treatment objective to control pain rather than to normalise alkaline phosphatase. Osteomalacia and osteoarthritis are ruled out because of the normal calcium and abnormal alkaline phosphatase. Osteoporosis is a systemic disease, so severe monoarticular involvement would be unusual, and primary hyperparathyroidism is associated with hypercalcaemia."

Finklestein's test is positive. Which of the following is the diagnosis?,Carpal tunnel syndrome,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Osteoarthirits,Radial tunnel syndrome,Rheumatoid arthritis,B,"Swelling and burning sensation over the thumb in a young individual with positive Finklestein's test is characteristic of De Quervain's tenosynovitis. Finklestein's test is performed by grasping the thump and ulnar deviating the hand sharply. It is positive if sharp pain occurs along the distal radius.  De Quervain's is caused by overuse of the thumb, as is the case here with this patient's job. Thickening of the synovial sheaths surrounding extensor pollicis brevis and abductor polices longus leads to pain and reduced movement. Osteoarthritis is a possibility but would be associated more commonly in older individuals, and tenderness is classically at the base of the thumb. Carpal tunnel presents with pain and paraesthesia of the thumb, index, middle and half of the ring fingers on the affected side. Radial tunnel syndrome presents with pain in the dorsal aspect of the upper forearm, and is caused by pressure on the radial nerve possibly from compression by the muscles of the forearm. Rheumatoid arthritis presents with joint swelling and pain, with subsequent hand deformity if left untreated. It is classically symmetrical."

She responds to treatment with IV hydrocortisone, nebulised salbutamol, and s/c adrenaline. Which of the following inflammatory mediators is thought to be important in anaphylaxis?",IL1,IL2,IL4,IL6,IL10,C,"Mediators involved in the development of anaphylaxis include histamine, leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and platelet aggregating factor, which are generated by mast cell degranulation. Additional factors include:  Tryptase Chimase Heparin Chondroitin sulphate IL4, and IL13.  IL4 and IL13 are thought to be important in driving the onward cascade of inflammation to other immune system cells and contribute to the severity of anaphylaxis. IL6 is inhibited by the medicaiton Tociluzumab during cytokine release syndromes.  IL10 is downregulated by the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitonib."
immune system,141,With regard to the role of the placenta in preventing immune rejection. Which of the following HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) genes is produced at high levels in the maternal interface and is thought to play an important role in suppressing maternal immune function and preventing immune attack against the fetus?,HLA-A,HLA-B,HLA-C,HLA-D,HLA-G,E,"In very basic terms during pregnancy at the trophoblast:HLA-A and HLA-B are downregulated HLA-E and HLA-G are upregulatedReproductive Immunology Immune Tolerance in PregnancyThe fetus can be considered an allograft with antigenically different material to the mother. A number of mechanisms therefore need to be in place to prevent 'graft rejection' in the form of the mother mounting an immune response against the foetus. The placenta plays a key role herePlacentaImmunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an immunologically privileged site i.e. able to tolerate foreign antigens without provocation of immune response. A number of mechanisms help achieve this:1. MHC (HLA complex) Antigen ExpressionIt has been shown that differences between class 1 and class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens are the basis for transplant rejection. In Trophoblast cells MHC class II antigens are not presented. HLA genes can be classes as 1a (HLA-A, -B, and -C) or 1b (HLA-E, -F, and -G) In trophoblast cells only HLA-C is expressed from the 1a group along with all three types of 1b genes. It has been shown that HLA-G in particular has several roles in immune suppression such as reduction of NK cell killing activity, reduction of IFN-y production, regulation of cytokine production and suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing activity and T-helper activity.2. Complement Protein InhibitionDAF, MCP and CD59 are proteins expressed by the placenta that inhibit complement proteins. Complement is an important part of the immune system in graft rejections.3.T-cells/T-helper cellsChanges to both the cell populations occur during pregnancy. Increased T regulatory cell (TREG cell) populations occur in pregnancy. These cells can both up and down regulate various immune responses. Th2 levels increase during pregnancy Th1 levels decrease during pregnancy4. PhosphocholinationThe addition of the phosphocholine molecule to glycoproteins inhibits T and B lymphocyte responses. It is a mechanism used by some parasites5. PDL1Cell signalling molecule that down regulates T-cell response6. ProgesteroneThought to play a role in immune suppression by stimulating lymphocytes to produce a blocking factor that mediates cytokine production.Other mechanismsPlacental exosomes, retroviral envelope proteins and CRH may all play a role in maternal immune tolerance but this level of detail is unlikely to be required by the MRCOG"
immune system,142,"A 52-year-old man who has a long history of chronic alcohol abuse presents with gouty tophi. He is commenced on allopurinol but develops severe joint pains two days later.

Investigations reveal:    Urate 0.55 mmol/L (0.23-0.46)   C reactive protein 150 mg/L (less than10)    Which of the following is the most likely cause for his presentation?",Acute pyrophosphate arthropathy,Acute rheumatoid arthritis,Allopurinol allergy,Septic arthritis,Treatment with allopurinol,E,"This man is having an acute attack of gout following the initiation of antihyperuricaemic (allopurinol) therapy. This can be minimised by not starting allopurinol immediately during or shortly after an acute attack of gout, abstaining from alcohol bingeing and gradually increasing the dose of allopurinol. Alcohol ingestion may also trigger an acute attack of gout, but in this case given the recent commencement of allopurinol, this is more likely to be the trigger. The most common features of allopurinol hypersensitivity are rash and fever. Joint sepsis affecting multiple joints is unlikely. Acute pseudogout (pyrophosphate arthropathy) presents with inflammation of the larger joints, the knees being most commonly affected. Given the history of alcohol abuse, gouty tophi and raised urate rheumatoid arthritis is not the most likely explanation."

immune system,144,A 35-year-old lady presents for follow up for a right-sided Colles' fracture. This was sustained following a slip in the kitchen at home. You are suspicious given the apparent low velocity mechanism of injury. Which of the following measurements would correspond to a diagnosis of osteoporosis?,T-score −1.5,T-score −2.5,Z-score −1.5,Z-score −2.0,None of the above,B,"It is important to be aware of the following:  Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement in premenopausal women Risk factors for low BMD in premenopausal women Definition of fragility fracture.  The scoring systems are differentiated by their reference populations:  T-scores compare the patient's bone mineral density (BMD) with that of a healthy young adult Z-scores compare the individual's BMD with that of a population of peers.  Osteoporosis is diagnosed according to the World Heath Organisation and International Osteoporosis Foundation criteria which state:  Osteoporosis: hip BMD 2.5 SD or more below the young adult reference mean (T score ≤−2.5). Severe osteoporosis: hip BMD 2.5 SD or more below the young adult reference mean in the presence of one or more fragility fractures (T-score ≤−2.5 PLUS fracture). Osteopenia: hip BMD between 1 and 2.5 DS below the young adult reference mean (T score less than −1 but above −2.5). Normal: hip BMD greater than the lower limit of normal which is taken as 1 SD below the young adult reference mean (T score ≥−1).  This fracture is suspicious of a fragility state because it has resulted from a mechanical force equivalent to a fall from standing height, which should not ordinarily cause a fracture. This result should prompt a search for osteoporotic risk factors. The Z-score is not routinely used in the diagnosis of osteoporosis. It compares bone mineral density to age-matched normal subjects, and also involves matching to age, sex and ethnicity. It can be used to investigate the possibility of osteoporosis in premenopausal women, men under the age of 50 and children. It is most useful when the bone mineral density is less than 2 standard deviations below the normal. "

It can have either an acute or subacute onset and is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and therefore constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss and malaise. The course of the disease is unpredictable, and 30% of patients also have giant cell arteritis. The cause is unknown, although studies showing a cyclical incidence have led to theories regarding an infectious trigger. Muscle weakness is not a feature of PMR, but this can be difficult to assess in the presence of pain. Investigations typically reveal:  Normochromic / normocytic anaemia Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) often greater than 50 mm/hr (although this may be normal) Raised C reactive protein (CRP).  PMR is not usually associated with an elevated rheumatoid factor, but it is important to note that this is present in 1-2% of the normal population. It is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. Features of giant cell arteritis should be sought:  Headache Visual disturbance Jaw claudication Thickened and tender temporal arteries.  Diagnosis of PMR can prove difficult, and other inflammatory conditions should be excluded. Patients are usually over 60 years, and PMR is very rarely seen in the under 50s. Response to a moderate dose of steroids can be useful. The maximum dose of prednisolone should not exceed 20 mg once daily. Patients should report 70% improvement in symptoms within three to four weeks, and inflammatory markers should have normalised by this point. In general, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have little use and are associated with significant morbidity. There is little evidence for the use of steroid-sparing agents."

Recent blood tests showed:    Haemoglobin 131 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 8.2 ×10^3/µl (4-11)   Neutrophil count 5.1 ×10^3/µl (1.5-7)   Platelet count 280 ×10^3/µl (150-400)   ESR 48 mm/hr (0-20)   Urea 5.0 mEq/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 82 mEq/L (60-110)   Sodium 142 mEq/L (137-144)   Potassium 4.2 mEq/L (3.5-4.9)    Rheumatoid factor (RF): positive (1:256). Antinuclear antibody (ANA): positive (1:40) What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pseudogout,Psoriatic arthritis,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,D,"Rheumatoid arthritis is the correct option. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis often present with synovitis which may affect a variety of joints before developing the classic features of a symmetrical, inflammatory polyarthritis affecting the small joints of the hands and feet. This patient has symptoms suggestive of peripheral synovitis, even though her signs are limited on the day of examination. The working diagnosis has to be rheumatoid arthritis, in view of the clinical history, duration and distribution of symptoms and signs, and the fact that she is strongly positive for rheumatoid factor. Rheumatoid arthritis is a clinical diagnosis. The classic features are:  Symmetrical inflammatory polyarthritis Arthritis affecting the small joints of the hands and feet.  The most commonly used classification criteria are the American College of Rheumatology criteria. These criteria do not perform well in early disease. Diagnostic tests are:  Rheumatoid factor: there are many false positive and negatives Anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti CCP antibody): more specific for rheumatoid arthritis Antinuclear antibody: present in 20-30% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Pseudogout is caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystals, and can present as an acute monoarthritis. It commonly affects older individuals, over 70-years-old, or those with pre-existing osteoarthritis. Attacks of pseudogout begin over a period of a few hours and usually subside after two weeks. Although knees are the most frequently involved joint in pseudogout, the age of this patient and length of symptoms make the diagnosis of pseudogout very unlikely. Lower limb oligoarthritis is one of the manifestations of psoriatic arthritis. However the absence of a family history of psoriasis or any psoriasis on examination makes this diagnosis unlikely. Reactive arthritis is incorrect since the absence of any preceding infection and symmetry of her symptoms and signs makes the diagnosis of reactive arthritis unlikely. This patient does not have other features of systemic lupus erythematosus which one may expect. She only has a low titre of antinuclear antibody which makes the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus unlikely, although it is important to note ANA is not specific for systemic lupus erythematosus. The inflammatory arthritis of systemic lupus erythematosus typically affects the hands, wrists and knees, with often little in the way of signs, but significant symptoms. Swelling is mainly soft tissue with small joint effusions. Large knee effusions are unusual."
immune system,149,"A 50 year old with obesity and hypertension present with pain and swelling in his left first MTP.  On examination there is evidence of swelling and erythema over his first MTP.  He is currently on Bendroflumethiazide, amlodipine and ramipril for his hypertension and also aspirin and orlistat.  There is nil else of note on examination.  An x-ray of his left foot shows reduced join space and calcification.  Which drug could be causative?",Orlistat,Bendroflumethiazide,Aspirin,Ramipril,Amlodipine,B,"The diagnosis is gout and this is secondary to raised uric acid levels which can occur in those with a rich diet, high alcohol intake and thiazide diuretics."
immune system,150,"A 71-year-old man, a known case of rheumatoid arthritis, presented with blue fingers on exposure to cold weather. He had had a particularly difficult winter and one of his fingers has also become black. He was under regular followup of his rheumatologist who attributed the symptom to a systemic manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis itself. The man also complained of generalized fatigue. Examination revealed moderate pallor, low BMI (16.3) and few axillary firm lymph nodes. His blood anti-CCP level was greater than200 IU/L (Nless than5). What is the likely cause of his symptoms?",Cold agglutinin disease,Acute exacerbation of rheumatoid arthritis,Axillary lymph nodes pressing on arteries,Drug induced,Primary Raynaud's disease,A,"This man with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has developed new-onset Raynaud's phenomenon like features. There is also pallor and lymphadenopathy. This is suggestive of an NHL developing in this patient along with paraneoplastic cold agglutinin disease. This is a rare form of haemolytic anemia associated with lymphoproliferative disorders. Usually, treatment of the underlying condition leads to resolution of the hemolysis. Long-standing RA patients can sometimes develop NHL. Usually, highly active disease has more chance of developing NHL. Acute exacerbation of RA is more likely to have joint pain than Raynaud's phenomenon. This man did not complain of joint pain. Axillary lymph nodes pressing on arteries is theoretically a possibility. But it is rare. Also, in NHL, the lymph nodes usually do not invade the arteries. They displace the blood vessels. Hence, chance of arterial compression is low. There is no mention of any drug like beta blockers or ergotamine in this scenario. Primary Raynaud's disease usually develops in middle-aged females. Also, it does not cause finger gangrene, as in this patient."

immune system,160,A 68-year-old woman presents with pain at the base of her right thumb. There is tenderness and swelling of the right first carpometacarpal joint. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Avascular necrosis of the scaphoid,De Quervain's tenosynovitis,Osteoarthritis,Psoriatic arthritis,Rheumatoid,C,"The first carpometacarpal joint is a frequent site of osteoarthritis in postmenopausal women. Clinical features include tenderness, stiffness, crepitus, swelling and pain on abduction of the thumb. Squaring of the hand, caused by swelling, radial subluxation of the metacarpal and atrophy of the thenar muscles, is a characteristic clinical sign. Scaphoid fractures are relatively common, typically occurring following a fall onto outstretched hand. The proximal portion lacks its own blood supply, so avascular necrosis can occur if a fracture leaves it isolated from the remainder of the scaphoid. This produces pain and tenderness of the radial side of the wrist, classically in the anatomical snuffbox rather than the base of the thumb, exacerbated by wrist movement. De Quervain's tenosynovitis disease is a common pathology which consists of a stenosing tenosynovitis of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. It typically presents with pain on the radial aspect of the wrist, with associated swelling and tenderness. Treatment is with splinting, with or without corticosteroid injection. "

What investigation should be performed?","Joint aspiration for gram stain, microscopy and culture",Blood culture,Xray of knee,Joint fluid microscopy,Analgesia,A,"With this history septic arthritis should be at the top of the differential diagnosis and therefore joint aspiration for gram stain, microscopy and culture is essential.  An xray is not diagnostic.  Fluid microscopy on its own is only useful for diagnosis of gout and pseudogout.  The history could make gout a possible diagnosis however a septic arthritis must always be excluded.  Patients are usually systemically unwell and pyrexial in septic arthritis."
immune system,162,A 52-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes presents with a two month history of painful hands and feet. Investigations confirm a diagnosis of sero-positive erosive rheumatoid arthritis. She has some pain relief from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. She currently takes metformin 500 mg tds and has good glycaemic control as reflected by a HbA1c of 50 mmol/mol (20-46). Which of the following DMARDS would be most appropriate initial treatment of her early rheumatoid arthritis?,Ciclosporin,Etanercept,Hydroxychloroquine,IM gold,Methotrexate,E,"Guidance recommends the use of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) early in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, maintaining function and reducing progression of the disease (SIGN 2001). First line agents include methotrexate and sulfasalazine (SIGN 2000) and most subjects receive methotrexate. Generally gold is considered more toxic than the former two and hydroxychloroquine is probably less effective. Ciclosporin is again rather more toxic than either methotrexate or sulfasalazine, with nephrotoxicity and immunosuppression and is generally reserved for RhA with systemic features such as vasculitis. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha antagonists, etanercept and infliximab, are generally reserved for individuals unresponsive to traditional DMARDS. "

There is no significant past or family history. On examination there is restricted chest wall expansion (3 cm) and the Schober's test is positive. Lumbar spine and pelvic radiographs are normal. Blood tests show a normal FBC, UEC and liver function tests. The CRP is 13 mg/L and the ESR is 32 mm/hr. Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",99m-Tc bone scan,HLA B-27,MRI lumbar spine,MRI sacroiliac joints,PET-CT,D,"Based on the presence of back pain, raised inflammatory markers and reduced spinal mobility, this patient has ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, potentially disabling, form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy which primarily involves the axial skeleton. The aetiology is not clearly understood, but it involves the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The pathology mainly affects the entheses, where ligaments, tendons and capsules are attached to the bone. Current British Society for Rheumatology recommendations state that the modified New York criteria should be used to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis: Clinical criteria:  Low back pain, present for more than three months, improved by exercise but not relieved by rest Limitation of lumbar spine motion in both the sagittal and frontal planes Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values for age and sex  Radiological criteria:  Sacroiliitis on x ray  Diagnosis:  Definite AS if the radiological criterion is present plus at least one clinical criterion Probable AS if three clinical criteria are present alone or if the radiological criterion is present but no clinicial criteria are present.  It is widely accepted that making the diagnosis early is difficult because the onset is insidious, and there is no definitive diagnostic test. One study has stated that the average time from onset to diagnosis ranges from three to 11 years. Timely diagnosis therefore requires a high index of suspicion. HLA-B27 is found in 90% patients with AS but also 8% of the general population and therefore should not be relied upon in making a diagnosis. MRI can visualise sacroiliitis in patients with typical symptoms of AS but normal radiographs, and it is evolving as the most important diagnostic imaging tool in early disease. However, as yet a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis cannot be made on MRI findings alone and these cases are currently termed non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). Both HLA-B27 and sacroiliitis on MRI play a major role in the recently proposed Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) diagnostic algorithm. This may replace the modified New York criteria in the future. An x ray of the lumbar spine may show bridging syndesmophytes between the vertebral bodies in keeping with ankylosing spondylitis but this is not part of the diagnostic criteria, and it is a late sign. Radiographic sacroiliitis is a requirement for patients to be eligible for anti-TNF treatment for AS. The sacroiliitis is usually bilateral and symmetrical. It progresses from blurring of the subchondral bone plate to irregular erosions of the margins of the sacroiliac joints to sclerosis, narrowing, and finally fusion. Erosions of the sacroiliac joint are generally seen earlier in the lower portion due to its synovial lining, and on the iliac side due to the thinner cartilage covering this side of the joint. As x ray is not available as an option here, MRI of the sacroiliac joints is the most appropriate answer. PET-CT and bone scans do not have a role in the diagnosis and investigation of ankylosing spondylitis. "

The bone marrow needle was in a lytic lesion filled with plasma cells. His serum globulin is high from a monoclonal gammopathy. Irrespective of the locaiton of the bone marrow aspirate the biopsy would show an increased population of plasma cells in the bone marrow. greater than10% plasma cells in the bone marrow with signs of organ damage (CRAB criteria) would be diagnostic of Myeloma or greater than60% with signs of elevated light chain ratio, multiple lytic lesions on MRI or evidence of plasmacytomas would also diagnose myeloma. Osteoblasts are most numerous in repair of bone, and callus is very firm. Fibroblasts produce collagen and are more numerous with the gross appearance of firm, white scar tissue. Giant cells may be seen in a variety of benign and malignant lesions of bone, but this does not explain the hypergammaglobulinaemia. Osteolytic metastases of renal cell carcinoma could have the gross appearance described here, but would not account for hypergammaglobulinaemia."

Which one of the following conditions is most likely to exhibit this pattern of joint involvement?,Osteoarthritis,Psoriatic arthritis,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,B,"This woman is most likely to have psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis has been subclassified according to different patterns of arthritis. The rash typically predates the arthropathy by a number of years, but the opposite can be true. Small plaques should be looked for on the elbows and scalp. There are five patterns of disease:  Symmetrical polyarthritis ('rheumatoid pattern') - affects wrists, hands, feet and ankles. The distal interphalangeal joints are more commonly affected than the metacarpophalangeal joints, which helps to distinguish it from rheumatoid arthritis Asymmetrical oligoarticular arthritis: dactylitis Distal interphalangeal joint disease: typically in men Arthritis mutilans (rare) Spondylitic pattern with sacroileitis.  Osteoarthritis in this age group is unlikely. Rheumatoid arthritis is a symmetrical arthritis typically affecting the metacarpophalangeal joints. Arthritis does occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, however there are several other clinical features that form part of the diagnositic criteria, none of which are present here. Reactive arthritis occurs following a gastrointestinal or genitourinary infection. It commonly affects the large joints."

Additionally, the disease is not confined to the joints. Damage is mediated by several means, including macrophages activated by CD4+ T cells, and by complement fixing immune complexes. There is no evidence for the creation of joint-specific antibodies in development. All the components of the joint are present during fetal life. The rheumatoid factor test utilises the patient's serum, to agglutinate cells coated with antibody.

What is the most likely explanation for the lack of clinical efficacy associated with this medication?",Fast acetylator status ,Impaired absorption of codeine,Inadequate dose of codeine,Interaction of paracetamol with codeine,Ipratropium accelerates the metabolism of codeine ,C,The most likely explanation is that the codeine dose is inadequate given some imrovement. Studies have shown that paracetamol 1 g combined with codeine at dose of 60 mg has the best analgesic outcomes. Ipratropium does not increase the metabolism of codeine and there is no interaction with paracetamol. There is also nothing in the history to suggest abnormal absorbtion or fast acetylation.

Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Behçet's disease,Inflammatory bowel disease,Reactive arthritis,Thyrotoxicosis,Tuberculosis,B,"The description of weight loss, diarrhoea and a mono/oligo-arthropathy suggests a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. (IBD). IBD-associated arthropathy is considered a subtype of seronegative spondyloarthropathy. A variety of joint involvement has been described, from large joint pauciarticular arthropathy to a rheumatoid pattern polyarthropathy. Peripheral arthritis is generally non-erosive and the oligoarticular variant particularly may correlate with intestinal disease activity. Axial arthritis may include inflammatory back pain, sacroilitis, or ankylosing spondylitis and is less likely to correlate with gastrointestinal symptoms. Whilst there have been genetic factors identified, the mechanisms surrounding the development of arthritis in IBD remain unclear. Treatment of the gastrointestinal disease is not always sufficient for control of arthritis, and biologic agents may be indicated. Behçet's disease is a chronic inflammatory multisystem disorder characterised by recurrent oral and genital aphthosis and ocular involvement. Whilst arthropathy is fairly common, disturbance in bowel habit would not be expected. It is mainly present along the ancient Silk Road, from the Mediterranean to East Asia. Reactive arthritis is an autoimmune condition that develops in response to an infection. Classically this is described as a triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and arthritis. Precipitating infections include gastrointestinal organisms such as Salmonella and genitourinary infections, especially Chlamydia. Diarrhoea, if present, is typically more acute than is described in this scenario. Whilst thyrotoxicosis can cause diarrhoea and arthralgia, a monoarthritis is unusual. Tuberculous arthritis is now very rare in Europe, but can present in the spine, hip or knee. Infection is either from haematogenous spread (from lungs or intestine) or local spread (from a tuberculous focus in a neighbouring bone). "

Rheumatoid arthritis is a complex disease which has many manifestations, and management should attempt to address all aspects. The British Society of Rheumatology has published guidelines on the management of RA within the first two years. These state that a diagnosis of RA should be made as early as possible, on the basis of persistent joint inflammation affecting at least three joints with early morning stiffness of at least 30 minutes. Such patients should have rapid access to a specialist team who can help to plan care, including training patients to self-manage some aspects of their disease. Specialist rheumatology nurses have a critical role to play within this team, as do physiotherapists, podiatrists, occupational therapists, and occasionally psychologists. If treatment is warranted, the first step is DMARD therapy (disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs). All patients should have their disease and its impact assessed and documented at onset, prior to starting DMARD therapy. Treatment should then be started as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made, ideally within three months of the onset of persistent symptoms. The most commonly used DMARD is methotrexate. Such treatment should be part of an aggressive package of care, including escalating doses, intra-articular steroids, parenteral methotrexate and combination therapy. Once established on DMARD therapy, all patients should have a formal assessment of treatment response, or lack of it, in order to justify continuing therapy or changing it. These assessments can include measurement of CRP and disease activity scores such as DAS28. Remission should be documented prior to reducing therapy. In addition to managing the musculoskeletal aspects of disease, it must not be forgotten that RA is a significant independent risk factor for ischaemic heart disease, and other risk factors should also be aggressively controlled. Systemic steroids can have an important role in establishing disease control, or bridging gaps between different DMARD therapies, but long-term use is not justified. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may be considered for symptom control during a mono- or oligo-articular flare of RA. This is a useful adjunct to therapy but is not appropriate long-term management in itself. Long-term used of NSAIDs should be at the lowest effective dose and should be avoided in those with high cardiovascular risk. Surgery may be indicated if any of the following persist, despite optimum medical therapy:  persistent pain as a result of joint or soft tissue damage worsening joint function progressive deformity persistent localised synovitis imminent or actual tendon rupture nerve compression, or stress fracture  There is little evidence for the long-term efficacy of dietary change, or complementary therapies, although a Mediterranean diet should be recommended. Patients should be helped to contact support organisations. The role of fatigue should be recognised and managed. Aerobic exercise should be encouraged. Over recent years, biological agents (especially inhibitors of tumour necrosis factor) have been developed. In the United Kingdom, anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) agents are used for the treatment of RA only if the patient fails to respond to an adequate trial of two DMARDs (eg. lefunomide, methotrexate, sulfasalazine). However, even with these, the frequency and degree of responses are restricted. Newer agents are therefore being introduced, including rituximab (anti-CD20), abatacept (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 immunoglobulin) and tocilizumab (anti-interleukin 6 receptor). "
immune system,188,"A 35-year-old black african woman who was two months postpartum presented with a four week history of joint pain, facial rash and fever. Blood tests reveal an ESR of 40 mm/hour (0-20). She states she's previously had similair symptoms which affeted the skin on her legs several year ago. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Sarcoidosis,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),Viral arthritis,D,"The triad of fever, arthralgia and rash in a woman of childbearing age should suggest the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Lupus can affect any areas of the skin and the symptoms she described before may be confused with Erythema Nodosum seen in Sarcoidosis. She does not describe shortness of breath however and so this is less likely. SLE is a heterogenous multisystem autoimmune inflammatory disease, in which antinuclear antibodies occur. Its presentation and course are highly variable, ranging from indolent to fulminant. The diagnosis is based on the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria. Management depends on disease severity. Reactive arthritis is a post-infective autoimmune condition that is associated with gastrointestinal (Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter) and genitourinary infections (Chlamydia). Classically it presents with arthritis and conjunctivitis. There will be a recent history of gastroenteritis or urethritis. Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with a persistent symmetrical polyarthritis affecting the hands and feet. Extra-articular features such as fever and rash occur much less commonly than in SLE. Anti-CCP antibodies are highly specific and should be tested if the diagnosis is suspected. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology, characterised by the presence of non-caseating granulomas in affected tissue. Approximately 5% of cases are asymptomatic and are detected on chest x ray. Sarcoid commonly presents with a dry cough, with or without dyspnoea and systemic complaints.  Viral arthritis is a condition which is difficult to diagnose. It occurs during the viral prodrome, and is often accompanied by a rash. Most commonly patients present with symmetrical small joint involvement, although the exact pattern depends on the causative virus. Viruses commonly associated include parvovirus B19, hepatitis A, B and C, rubella and HIV. Whilst the fever, rash and joint pain in the above scenario would be consistent with viral arthritis, symptoms would have typically resolved over a four week period."

Of relevance amongst his investigations, is a white cell count of 12.6 ×10^9/L (4-11) and a knee radiograph which shows reduced joint space and calcification of the articular cartilage. Culture of aspirated fluid reveals no growth. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Gout,Pseudogout,Psoriatic monoarthropathy,Rheumatoid arthritis,Septic arthritis,B,"This is a typical presentation of pseudogout (calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy) with evidence of osteoarthritis, calcification of the articular cartilage and no growth on synovial culture. Classically there is rapid onset inflammatory symptoms and signs. Risk factors include age, osteoarthritis and metabolic disturbance (e.g. primary hyperparathyroidism, haemochromatosis). Management of acute episodes include cool packs, rest, joint aspiration and steroid injection. Prophylaxis is typically with oral NSAIDs and/or low-dose colchicine. Oral corticosteroids, methotrexate or hydroxycholoroquine can be used in resistant disease. Asymptomatic crystal deposition does not need treatment. The differential does include gout but isolated monoarthritis of the knee is less common than with pseudogout. Distinguishing between the two depends on analysis of the crystals with calcium pyrophosphate crystals demonstrating no ora positive birefringence and urate crystals demonstrating a negative birefringence under polarising light. Distinguishing between the two depends on analysis of the crystals with CPP crystals demonstrating a positive birefringence and urate crystals demonstrating a negative birefringence. It is rare for rheumatoid arthritis to present as a large joint monoarthritis is a gentleman of this age. Negative synovial fluid culture makes septic arthritis a less likely diagnosis. There are five classic presenations of psoriasis (none of which fit with this scenario):  Symmetrical polyarthritis: 'rheumatoid pattern' Asymmetric oligoarticular/pauciarticular arthritis: initial involvement of the hands and feet with dactylitis Distal interphalangeal joint predominant involvement Arthritis mutilans, and Spondylitic pattern.  The typical rash of psoriasis usually predates the onset of arthritis. "

What is the most likely diagnosis?",DeQuervain’s tenosynovitis,Gouty arthritis,Osteoarthritis,Pyrophosphate arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,C,"This woman has clinical and radiological features consistent with osteoarthritis (OA) of the first right carpometacarpal (CMC) joint. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common joint disease, and its incidence is increasing with the age and weight of the population. It is characterised by joint pain, crepitus, stiffness after mobility, and limitation of motion, commonly affecting the knees, hips and small joints of the hand. The CMC joint is classically involved, and involved in gripping and twisting. Joint swelling is bony in nature, unlike the boggy swelling which occurs in inflammatory arthritis. Thenar wasting occurs in OA of the first CMC joint due to disuse. Pathogenesis involves the localised loss of cartilage, with remodelling of adjacent bone. The associated pain is exacerbated by exercise and relieved by rest, although in advanced disease rest and night pain can develop. There may also be joint stiffness, typically in the morning or after rest. Diagnosis is often late, and treatment is usually aimed at reducing pain and improving function rather than targeting the disease process. This woman's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is not significantly raised and her C reactive protein (CRP) is within normal range making an inflammatory arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis unlikely. A positive rheumatoid factor does not make the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. The frequency of positive rheumatoid factor in normal individuals of age over 70 is upto 10-20%. The predominant feature of gouty arthritis is pain, and it rarely affects the hands. Pyrophosphate arthropathy can complicate osteoarthritis but it usually presents with acute onset large joint monoarthritis. De Quervain's disease is a common pathology which consists of a stenosing tenosynovitis of the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. It typically presents with pain on the radial aspect of the wrist, with associated swelling and tenderness. Treatment is with splinting, with or without corticosteroid injection. "

What is the most likely diagnosis?",ANA negative SLE,Cryoglobulinaemia,Infective endocarditis,Polyarteritis nodosa,Rheumatoid arthritis,B,"The history is strongly suggestive of systemic vasculitis with mononeuritis multiplex, purpuric rash and haematuria. It is important to exclude conditions which can mimic vasculitis such as infective endocarditis. The normal echocardiogram and negative blood cultures make this unlikely. Whilst polyarteritis nodosa can present with exactly this clinical picture, the marked consumption of C4 together with a strongly positive rheumatoid factor strongly suggests cryoglobulinaemia as the underlying cause. Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins which precipitate in the cold. They can be  Type I (monoclonal) Type II (mixed monoclonal and polyclonal) or Type III (polyclonal).  Type I cryoglobulinaemia is associated with haematological diseases such as myeloma and Waldenstrom's. Type II and Type III cryoglobulinaemia can be associated with many connective tissue disorders, chronic infections and most importantly, hepatitis C infection which should always be excluded. Treatment of cryoglobulinaemia would include plasmaphoresis, high dose steroids and cyclophosphamide. The following conditions may be associated with a positive rheumatoid factor:  Rheumatoid arthritis - 26 to 90% Sjögren's syndrome - 75 to 95% Mixed connective tissue disease - 50 to 60% Mixed cryoglobulinemia (types II and III) - 40 to 100% Systemic lupus erythematosus - 15 to 35% Polymyositis/dermatomyositis - 5 to 10%"

Anti dsDNA levels do vary with disease activity and are therefore useful and are sometimes used to alter therapy. Complement levels decrease in active disease and features on the SLE disease activity index from the ACR and can be used to alter management. ESR can be used to monitor disease activity and response whilst CRP is often normal.
immune system,203,Which of the following auto-antibodies may have a role in monitoring disease activity?,Anti-ds DNA antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),Antinuclear antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus,Anti-Ro (SSA) antibodies in Sjogren's syndrome ,Anti-Sm antibodies in systemic lupus erythematosus,Rheumatoid factor in rheumatoid arthritis ,A,The serum levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies appear to correlate with disease activity in many patients and often levels will rise just before a flare of disease. The relationship is not close enough to be able to alter treatment based on a rising titre of antibodies but patients should be followed more closely in this situation. Anti-Sm antibodies are very specific for SLE but not sensitive and there is no evidence that levels change with disease activity. The only other autoantibody where there may be some correlation between levels and disease activity is circulating anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (cANCA) in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Most cases do not have a specific aetiology, but Cushing's syndrome with hypercortisolism can promote osteoporosis. Her age should make you suspicious. Hypoparathyroidism is not going to accelerate bone loss. The bone resorption that accompanies hyperparathyroidism can cause osteoporosis. Over 95% of cases of osteoporosis are 'primary' with unknown cause. Elevated serum globulin should make you suspect a monoclonal gammopathy, but myeloma leads to focal bone lytic lesions. Hyperuricaemia can be associated with gout that can cause focal bone destruction near affected joints, the bone mass overall is not decreased."

Over time joint damage will relate to disability. A positive rheumatoid factor is associated with:  More severe erosive disease Extra-articular manifestations including subcutaneous nodules and Increased mortality.  An acute onset of presentation is not a poor prognostic factor.

immune system,208,"A 60 year old female from Asia presents complaining of pain in her bones and muscle weakness.  An xray is performed of the femur and reveals linear low density areas surrounded by sclerotic areas.  Bloods revealed elevated ALP, low phosphate and normal calcium levels.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hyperparathyroidism,Pagets disease,Renal Osteopdystrophy,Osteomalacia,Osteoporosis,D,The diagnosis is osteomalacia with the characteristic evidence of Loosers zones on the xray. It leads to elevated ALP and low phosphate due to parathroid hormone excretion.  In Pagets disease the ALP is also elevated however calcium and phosphate levels are normal.  However unlike osteomalacia there is evidence on x-ray of sclerotic phase of bone expansion and loss of distinction between cortex and trabeculae.  Osteoporosis does not lead to the x-ray or blood results and only causes pain when there has been a fracture.  Similarly hyperparathyroidism and renal osteodystrophy do not lead to the features described.

Blood tests reveal an elevated serum alkaline phosphatase. What is the most likely pathologic process that explains these findings?",Metastatic adenocarcinoma,Mineral density,Paget's disease of bone,Renal failure with renal osteodystrophy,Vitamin D deficiency,C,"This man has Paget's disease, with bone pain, cardiac failure and sensorineural deafness. Paget's disease of bone is a localised disorder of bone remodelling. There are increased numbers of giant osteoclasts, which increase bone resorption with subsequent increase in new bone formation and altered bone architecture. The structure of the new bone is disorganised and mechanically weaker, and therefore liable to pathological fracture and deformity. It can affect any bone, but is commonest in the axial skeleton, long bones and skull. The hands and feet are rarely affected. Both genetic and environmental factors are implicated, and it has been suggested paramyxovirus is involved. The majority of patients affected are over the age of 55, and men are more commonly affected. The UK has the highest prevalence of Paget's disease in the world. The signs and symptoms of Paget's are varied, depending on the location of involved sites and the degree of increased bone turnover. It is commonly asymptomatic and is discovered by an elevated serum alklaline phosphatase or typical radiographic findings. When symptoms do occur, the most common are bone pain and/or deformity. Deafness or tinnitus are not uncommon, due to compression of cranial nerve VIII. The most concerning complication is the development of osteosarcoma, which carries a poor prognosis. Management concentrates on control of pain and the reduction of complications. In addition to analgesia, bisphosphonates are the mainstay of treatment. These reduce bone turnover, improve pain, promote healing of osteolytic lesions and restore normal bone histology. Serial monitoring of alkaline phosphatase can help to monitor treatment. Decreased bone mineral density is seen in osteoporosis, which is not associated with a rise in alkaline phosphatase. Bone metastases may be osteolytic, sclerotic or mixed on radiograph, but typically spread to destroy the medullary bone. Renal osteodystrophy combines features of osteitis fibrosa cystica and osteomalacia, and is typically more focal than described in this scenario. Vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia, which does not present with the clinical features decribed above. "

Which of the following white blood cells binds to MHC class I?,B lymphocytes,CD4 positive T lymphocytes,CD8 positive T lymphocytes,Eosinophils,Macrophages,C,"The answer is CD8 positive T lymphocytes. MHC class I is present on the cell surface of virally infected or irreparably damaged cells, and presents antigens to CD8 positive lymphocytes which subsequently promote programmed cell death by releasing perforin granzymes and granylysin. CD4 positive lymphocytes recognise antigens bound to MHC class II on the surface of antigen presenting cells. B lymphocytes recognise antigens via their B lymphocyte receptor, rather than in conjunction with MHC class I. Eosinophils are activated primarily by cytokines rather than by MHC binding, and the main role of macrophages is in phagocytosis."

It can have either an acute or subacute onset and is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and therefore constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss and malaise.The course of the disease is unpredictable, and 30% of patients also have giant cell arteritis. The cause is unknown, although studies showing a cyclical incidence have led to theories regarding an infectious trigger.Diagnosis of PMR can prove difficult, and other inflammatory conditions should be excluded. Patients are usually over 60 years, and PMR is very rarely seen in the under 50s. Muscle weakness is not a feature of PMR, but this can be difficult to assess in the presence of pain.Due to chronic inflammation, low grade fever and weight loss are often present. Weight gain is unusual, and peripheral joints are only rarely affected. Muscle tenderness is not a specific feature of polymyalgia rheumatica, and is not a classical finding. Patientandamp;#39;s describe pain and stiffness, but the muscles are often not significantly tender. This is more suggestive of myositis or fibromyalgia. Investigations typically reveal:Normochromic / normocytic anaemiaRaised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) often greater than 50 mm/hr (although this may be normal)Raised C reactive protein (CRP).Features of giant cell arteritis should be sought:HeadacheVisual disturbanceTransient ischaemic attacks (TIAs)Jaw claudication andThickened and tender, temporal arteries.Response to a moderate dose of steroids can be useful in confirming the diagnosis of PMR. The maximum dose of prednisolone should not exceed 20 mg once daily. Patients should report 70% improvement in symptoms within three to four weeks, and inflammatory markers should have normalised by this point.In general, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have little use and are associated with significant morbidity. There is little evidence for the use of steroid-sparing agents."

Which of the following antibodies is most likely to be linked to the illness in the baby?",Anti-LKM,Anti-Ro/SSA,Anti-smooth muscle,c-ANCA,Rheumatoid factor,B,"Neonatal lupus is an uncommon condition associated with the transplacental passage of maternal anti-Ro and/or anti-La autoantibodies. Findings may include:  Cutaneous lupus lesions Third-degree heart block Cardiomyopathy Hepatobiliary disease, and Cytopenias.  Typically only one organ is affected in each infant. The most severe manifestation is the heart block, which usually begins during the second trimester of pregnancy. It is rare, occurring in only 2% of mothers with anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies. Once established this is permanent, unlike the other manifestations which are generally transient. The rash is most frequently seen around the eyes, but also occurs in other parts of the body. Asymptomatic elevation of liver function tests is seen in 10-25% of cases. Overall, non-cardiac involvement is more common than cardiac. A significant number of babies with neonatal lupus are born to mothers who are not known to have systemic lupus erythematosus. Anti-LKM and anti-smooth muscle antibodies are associated with autoimmune hepatitis. c-ANCA is highly specific for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

He has also noticed that it has been painful when he is urinating. He has recently had unprotected sex. A joint aspiration does not culture any microorganisms but there is elevated neutrophils. He is intolerant to NSAIDs. Which of the following is the next most appropriate management choice?,Methotrexate,Sulfasalazine,IM Diclofenac,Intra-articular steroid injection,Paracetamol,D,"The history is inkeeping with Reactive arthritis. It most commonly follows bloody diarrhoea caused by salmonella, campylobacter spp, shigella and yersinia or post STI, most commonly chlamydia trachomatis or HIV. Joint aspiration should be performed to exclude a septic arthritis. There is usually an elevated neutrophil count but no organisms are identified. NSAIDs are the mainstay of treatment and intra-articular steroid injections are useful in monoarticular joint involvement. In this case due to the intolerance of NSAIDs then it is appropriate in this case to utilise intra articular steroids. If there is more than one joint involved then oral steroids may be more appropriate. It is also useful to treat any continuing infection with antibiotics e.g. in this case there may be chlamydia and this should be screened and treated. If the arthritis is unresponsive then sulfasalazine and other DMARDs have been shown to be beneficial."

On examination, the left knee is warm, tender, and there is a large effusion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Carcinomatous arthropathy,Gout,Inflammatory arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease,Reactive arthritis,Psoriatic arthirtis,C,"This patient has chronic diarrhoea (more than two week duration), most likely to be due to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). IBD associates with asymmetric oligoarthritis. Knees and ankles are the most commonly affected joints. The clinical course of peripheral joint (appendicular) inflammatory arthritis associated with IBD frequently follows the clinical course of gut disease. This form of enteropathic arthritis frequently remits after successful treatment of bowel disease. IBD also associates with sacroiliitis (axial disease). There is no association between the clinical course of sacroiliitis and gut disease. It is worth bearing in mind that sacroiliitis may precede the onset of IBD by many years in some cases, and as outlined above may progress despite bowel resection. Reactive arthritis is unlikely as the arthritis in reactive arthritis occurs a few weeks (4-6 weeks) after the resolution of infection. There is no risk factor of gout (age less than 50 years, female gender, low alcohol intake), malignancy, and there is no personal or family history of psoriasis."

Her investigations reveal an ESR of 40 mm/hr (0-10) and positive anticentromere antibodies. Which of the following is a typical late complication of this disorder?,Alopecia ,Butterfly skin rash ,Erosive polyarthropathy ,Myositis ,Pulmonary hypertension ,E,"The history here is suggestive of a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. Pulmonary hypertension is more commonly associated with the diffuse form of systemic sclerosis, rather than the limited cutaneous form (previously referred to as CREST syndrome). Telangiectasia and dyspepsia can be associated with either form. Anti-centromere antibodies are associated with an increased risk of pulmonary hypertension. Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by increased fibroblast activity and fibrosis in a number of different organ systems. 90-95% of patients have positive antinuclear antibodies. There are two major subtypes: limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous. CREST syndrome is an older term for the limited cutaneous form (calcinosis, Raynauds' phenomenon, oeosophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia). Patients with systemic sclerosis can present with skin abnormalities, musculoskeletal changes, gastrointestinal complications, pulmonary disease, renal crisis and dry eyes and mouth. Dyspepsia, restricted distension of the gastric antrum and diffuse gastrointestinal dysmotility are frequent features. This is due both to fibrosis and muscle atrophy, and autonomic neuropathy. Pulmonary hypertension can present in isolation in systemic sclerosis, or in association with interstitial lung disease or cardiac dysfunction. It is a frequent cause of morbidity and mortality. Despite advances in echocardiography and biomarkers, right heart catheterisation remains the diagnostic test to differentiate pulmonary veno-occlusive disease from hypertension. This is essential because pulmonary vasodilator therapy can increase mortality in veno-occlusive disease. Recent studies have investigated the use of non-invasive screening, but their use remains controversial. Treatment options are limited, and prognosis is worse than with idiopathic pulmonary hypertension. Median survival is one year from diagnosis. Extrapulmonary disease in systemic sclerosis limit candidacy for lung transplantation. New therapies that target abnormal cellular proliferation in the pulmonary vasculature are currently under investigation. Erosive polyarthropathy is typically present in the earlier stages of systemic sclerosis, and would not be classified as a late complication. A malar, or butterfly, rash is classically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It involves the bridge of the nose, but spares the naso-labial folds. It is usually well demarcated and macular. It is not pathognomonic of SLE, and can be seen in pellagra and dermatomyositis, but again none of these would account for the symptoms described above. Alopecia and myositis are not commonly associated with systemic sclerosis. "

He also had left jaw claudication and tingling and numbness in his hands with difficulty in performing fine movements for the last 10 days. In addition he has had stiffness in his shoulders and neck with difficulty getting up from a chair for a few weeks. He has lost a stone in six weeks and has had night sweats. He has not travelled recently. He is a non-smoker and does not drink alcohol. His past medical history includes late onset asthma, recurrent sinusitis and allergic rhinitis. Examination revealed no perception of light in left eye, weak hand grip and power 4/5 in proximal muscles of the lower limbs with normal reflexes and down going plantars. He was pyrexial with a temperature of 38.9°C. Fundoscopy revealed a possible left retinal artery infarct. His temporal arteries were palpable and non-tender.

ANA was negative and immunoglobulins were normal. Total IgE was 233 (normal range 4.2-595 U/ml). Muscle biopsy showed no evidence of myositis. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA),Giant cell arteritis,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Hypereosinophilic syndrome,B,"Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of small-vessel vasculitis, characterised by asthma, allergic rhinitis and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia. Rarely, it can cause either an anterior or a posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, which presents with visual loss as is the case here. Whilst the history seems typical of giant cell arteritis the raised eosinophilia count and positive MPO antibodies should lead you to a diagnosis of EGPA. The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. EGPA, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The unifying feature of patients presenting with EGPA is asthma. Vasculitis involving the peripheral nervous system is also a characteristic feature, and mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 75% of patients. Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with EGPA. Forty to 60% are associated with positive ANCA, usually pANCA/MPO. Intravenous glucocorticoid is used for initial therapy of acute multi-organ disease, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy, often with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent.. Loss of vision must be treated aggressively. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus. Its clinical presentation varies from corticosteroid-dependent asthma to diffuse bronchiectasis with fibrosis. Visual loss is not an associated feature. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and a small-vessel vasculitis. A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is characterised by a peripheral blood eosinophil count of greater than1.5 for more than six months. Generalised symptoms are fatigue, myalgia, fever, night sweats, diarrhoea and pruritus. Other symptoms depend on the organ involved: cardiac disease causes chest pain and dyspnoea, respiratory disease presents with a dry cough. "

On examination, there was synovitis of both wrists. There was no proximal muscle tenderness or weakness. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 50 mm/hr (0-20). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR),Polymyositis,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,D,"This is a slightly difficult question, but you may experience similar during the exam. It tests your ability to consider epidemiology as well as your knowledge of disease presentations. In this middle aged female, the acute bilateral arthritis of shoulders and wrists together with synovitis and raised ESR are highly suggestive of acute rheumatoid arthritis. The features given do not fully satisfy the ACR criteria (see the reference for updated guidelines), but it is not unusual for this to be the case in clinical practice. Weakness and myalgia would be expected with polymyositis and a rash would be expected with systemic lupus erythematosus with less evidence of a synovitis. There is no prior precipitant to suggest a reactive arthritis, although it is important to consider this diagnosis in young patients. PMR would be less likely in this age group as it usually occurs in patients over 50 years of age Proximal weakness in the morning with the gel phenomenon would be expected, and synovitis in the wrists would be less likely in PMR.

Osteosarcoma occurs in 1% of patients with Paget's disease, and accounts for 30% of cases of late onset osteosarcoma. Although Paget's disease is associated with pathological fracture at the affected site, this man is not known to have Paget's disease at the humerus - which is an uncommon site for Paget's disease anyway; and there is no history of injury. Similarly, the speed of progression of symptoms, presence of night pain and normal joint movements precludes the diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Gout ,Haemochromatosis ,Osteoarthritis ,Pyrophosphate arthropathy,Rheumatoid arthritis with amyloidosis,B,"This gentleman has haemochromatosis. The typical presenting features are diabetes, bronzing of the skin, hepatomegaly (due to iron deposition) and arthropathy (especially of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, with hook-like osteophytes on x ray). Occasionally the arthropathy affects larger joints such as the hips, knees and shoulders and can resemble rheumatoid arthritis. Other rheumatic manifestations include acute pyrophosphate arthropathy, asymptomatic chondrocalcinosis and osteoporosis. Hereditary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disorder, so taking a family history is helpful in these cases. Affected patients are at increased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Regular phlebotomy is the main treatment, although iron chelation and therapeutic erythrocytapheresis may become more widely used in the future. The second and third metacarpophalangeal joints are rarely affected in isolation in osteoarthritis, and this would not explain the hepatomegaly and symptoms of diabetes. The distribution of the arthropathy, and associated polyuria and polydipsiais not typical for gout or pseudogout (pyrophosphate arthropathy). Amyloidosis secondary to rheumatoid arthritis would account for the hepatomegaly and small joint arthropathy, but diabetes is very rarely a consequence.

immune system,240,"All of the below are thought to predispose to the development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), except which?",Exogenous oestrogen administration,HLA-DR3,Congenital deficiency of C2,HLA-B8,Breastfeeding,E,"The specific cause of SLE is unknown, but multiple genetic predispositions and environmental factors have been identified. The underlying mechanism is thought to be associated with a deficiency in immune clearance, which results in autoimmunity.   Patients with HLA-DR3, HLA-A1, and HLA-B8 are throught to have an innate susceptibility, as are those with abnormal complement levels (especially congenital deficiencies of C4 or C2) or specific immunoregulatory genotypes (mainly related to B-cell receptor pathway signalling). UV exposure, microbial response and drugs can then interact with this innate susceptibility to result in the development of SLE.  There is an increased risk in relatives of those affected, with 40% concordance in monozygotic twins.   The role of infection in the aetiology of SLE has been extensively investigated, and it has been found that patients have higher antibody titres against EBV than the general population which is postulated to result in a T-cell abnormality with causes failure of the normal regulation of the B-cell response. In addition, chronic infections can result in anti-DNA antibodies and bacterial infections can precipitate a flare of SLE symptoms.  Environmental factors are more complex, but some associations have been found: Silica dust, exogenous oestrogen administration and cigarette smoking may increase the risk of developing SLE. Breastfeeding seems to decrease the risk of developing SLE. UV light is a clear precipitant of skin disease, by stimulating keratinocytes resulting in overexpression of surface nuclear ribonucleoproteins and cytokine secretion with subsequent increased autoantibody production.  Vitamin D deficiency may also result in increased autoantibody production.  "

Knee crepitus occurs with patella-femoral osteoarthritis. Gout is unlikely, as there is no history of episodes of acute crystal synovitis. Also there are no risk factors for gout, for example, excess alcohol intake, renal impairment, or diuretic use. There is no symptom suggestive of inflammatory arthritis, for example, early morning stiffness, or synovitis. The lack of a personal or family history of psoriasis makes psoriatic arthritis very unlikely.

She does not have any muscle weakness, or rash making dermatomyosisits unlikely. Dermatomyosisits associates with Gottron's papules on extensor surface of hands, and a periorbital heliotrope rash. The co-existence of myositis, arthritis, and scleroderma in those with anti-U1 RNP antibodies suggests mixed connective tissue disease. This is clearly not the case here."
immune system,245,"A 28-year-old woman with a 15 year history of Raynaud's phenomenon and no other symptoms had some blood tests with her GP. These show that she has a homogeneous pattern anti-nuclear antibody in a titre of 1:5120, and that she is negative for anti-dsDNA antibody using the Crithidia luciliae assay. A full blood count, urea electrolyte and creatinine, liver function tests, and C3 and C4 are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Discoid lupus erythematosus,Primary Raynaud's phenomenon,Scleroderma,Sjögren's syndrome,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),B,"Diffuse staining ANA on immunofluorescence in high titre raises the possibility of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Further tests are required to ascertain if the diffuse staining ANA is due to anti-dsDNA (pathogenic in SLE) or due to anti ss-DNA antibody (not thought to play a pathogenic role in SLE). Crithidia luciliae immunofluorescence is positive only in the presence of anti-dsDNA antibody. This is as Crithidia luciliae has a giant mitochondrion, with a circular dsDNA. It does not have ssDNA or any histones. In routine clinical practice, only anti-dsDNA are tested for. Diffuse staining ANA on immunofluorescence, in low titres (less than1:160) is very common in the general population. Although not mutually exclusive, different ANA immunofluorescence patterns suggest different diseases:  Anti-centromere pattern: limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis Cytoplasmic pattern: Sjögren's syndrome, anti-synthetase syndrome Nucleolar pattern: diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis Speckled pattern: mixed connective tissue disease.  This patient has no symptoms to support the diagnoses of  Discoid lupus erythematosus (scarring photosensitive skin ulceration) Sjögren's syndrome (dry eyes, dry mouth, fatigue) Scleroderma (Raynaud's phenomenon, skin thickening, tightness, telangiectasia), and SLE (photosensitive rash).  Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for diagnosis of SLE. However, they are neither necessary, nor sufficient in themselves for the diagnosis of SLE. At any one time only 50% patients with SLE have the anti-dsDNA antibody, while only 70% patients with SLE develop anti-dsDNA antibodies at any one time during the course of their illness. Raynaud's phenomenon is a common clinical presentation, which may be primary or secondary to underlying disease. It can be diagnosed if there is a history of clearly demarcated pallor of the digit(s) followed by at least one other colour change (cyanosis and/or erythema). Symptoms are usually precipitated by cold (or less commonly emotion). Vasospasm without endothelial damage is thought to be the main cause for primary RP. The pathogenesis of secondary forms is probably initiated primarily by endothelial damage. Physical examination, nailfold capillaroscopy and immunological tests can differentiate between primary and secondary Raynaud's. You should suspect secondary Raynaud's phenomenon if any of the following are present:  Onset at more than 30 years of age Intense, painful or asymmetrical episodes Presence of additional clinical features suggestive of underlying disease Positive anti-nuclear antibody Abnormal nailfold capillaries Digital ulcers, gangrene or severe ischaemia of one or more digits.  Primary Raynaud's can be diagnosed if all the following are present:  No suspicion of underlying disease Symmetrical episodes affecting both hands, but not necessarily all fingers No tissue necrosis, ulceration, gangrene or severe ischaemia Normal nailfold capillaries Normal ESR and negative anti-nuclear antibodies.  Treatment involves prevention so that permanent ischaemic damage can be avoided. Patients should avoid exposure to the cold. The mild forms of primary RP can be controlled by non-pharmacological approaches alone. If insufficient, the first choice therapy is calcium channel blockers. In severe forms, intravenous prostaglandin, endothelin-1 receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are used. Future treatment options may include selective alpha-2c adrenergic receptor blockers, tyrosine and Rho-kinase inhibitors and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Differential diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon includes:  Chilblains (perniosis): erythematous itchy swellings on fingers and toes in response to cold Acrocyanosis: continuous blueness of the extremities aggravated by cold Erythromelalgia: painful erythema caused by paroxysmal dilatation of blood vessels Vascular embolism Livedo reticularis: mottled, cyanotic discolouration of skin.  All the other features described here would be consistent with a diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease. Whilst miscarriage can be associated with connective tissue disease, in particular antiphospholipid syndrome, it is common in the population especially in early pregnancy. "

Which of the following antibodies is most likely to be detected in the maternal serum?,Anti-dsDNA antibodies,Anti-endomysial antibodies,Anti-Ro/SSA antibodies,Anti-SCL70 antibodies,Rheumatoid factor,C,The majority of cases of congenital heart block are due to the presence of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies in the maternal serum. The mother may have no evidence of a connective tissue disorder. The risks of congenital heart block in mothers with anti-Ro/SSA antibodies remains very small (less than3%) but the correlation between the presence of anti-Ro/SSA antibodies and congenital heart block is very strong. The heart block is generally permanent (unlike other features of neonatal lupus) and insertion of a permanent pacemaker is frequently required.

This presentation is likely due to renal vein thrombosis (causing flank pain with haematuria and proteinuria), highlighting the possibility of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS). Antibodies commonly associated with APS are anticardiolipin antibodies. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a common cause of acquired thrombophilia and characterised by arterial and/or venous thrombosis and pregnancy mortality in association with circulating antiphospholipid antibodies. These are a heterogenous group of approximately twenty autoantibodies directed against phospholipid binding plasma proteins. Three of the most clinically important are:  The lupus anticoagulant Anti-beta-2 glycoproetin I antibodies, and The anticardiolipin antibodies.  They can be detected either by phospholipid-dependent coagulation test for lupus anticoagulant or ELISA test for anticoagulation and anti-β2GPI antibodies. Antibodies should be demonstrated on at least two occasions separated by 12 weeks. Antiphospholipid syndrome may be primary, or associated with other conditions (such as systemic lupus erythematosus). Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are characteristic of Goodpasture's syndrome, which presents with acute kidney injury with or without alveolar haemorrhage. Antimitochondrial antibodies are seen in primary biliary cirrhosis, which causes fatigue, pruritus and abdominal pain, with jaundice as a late sign. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are a heterogenous group of antibodies which are seen in a variety of vasculitides. Antistreptolysin-O antibodies are directed against group A Streptococci, which can be associated with a variety of clinical presentations including scarlet fever. "

Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and cyclosporin A are contraindicated in breast-feeding mothers. In general, SLE does not affect the fertility of patients. However, fertility may be adversely affected in specific subgroups of patients such as those with renal failure, cyclophosphamide treatment, very active disease or high dose corticosteroids. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are associated with increased risk of congenital heart block. The risk is greater with anti-Ro positivity than anti-La positivity. The risk of congenital heart block in the presence of anti-Ro may be up to 5%. Stopping any unnecessary drugs is advisable in pregnancy, however use of azathioprine, hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone in pregnancy is considered safe if these are necessary for treatment of the mother's disease. Risk of pre-eclampsia is increased in SLE. It may be difficult to differentiate between pre-eclampsia and renal flare of SLE, and both may coexist. Differentiating features include raised anti-dsDNA antibody, decreased complement levels (C3 and C4) and response to steroids in the case of renal flare."

Which one of the following is most likely to develop as a further complication of this disorder?",Anterior uveitis,Butterfly rash,Erosive joint disease,Erythema nodosum,Malabsorption,E,"Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by increased fibroblast activity and fibrosis in a number of different organ systems. 90-95% of patients have positive antinuclear antibodies. There are two major subtypes: limited cutaneous and diffuse cutaneous. CREST syndrome is an older term for the limited cutaneous form (calcinosis, Raynauds' phenomenon, oeosophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia). Patients with systemic sclerosis can present with skin abnormalities, musculoskeletal changes, gastrointestinal complications, pulmonary disease, renal crisis and dry eyes and mouth. Involvement of the gastrointestinal tract can occur from mouth to anus with varying degrees of severity. It can be present in those with both the diffuse and limited cutaneous forms. Most GIT manifestations result from dysmotility secondary to infiltration of the intestinal wall with fibrous tissue, and can cause life-threatening malabsorption and malnutrition. Gastric emptying is delayed in 10-75% of patients and causes symptoms of early satiety, bloating and emesis. Treatments include metoclopramide and erythromycin. The small bowel is also involved in 20-60% of patients, due to reduced or absent migrating motor complexes predisposing to bacterial overgrowth. The contributes to malabsorption, as does associated pancreatic insufficiency. In the colon there is often development of diverticuli involving all layers of the intestinal wall, or constipation due to reduced motility. Anterior uveitis can be associated with ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis and Behcet's disease. None of these have clinical features which fit with the description above. A malar, or butterfly rash, is classically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It involves the bridge of the nose, but spares the naso-labial folds. It is usually well demarcated and macular. It is not pathognomonic of SLE, and can be seen in pellagra and dermatomyositis, but again none of these would account for the symptoms described above. Erosive arthritis is present in approximately 30% of cases of systemic sclerosis, which makes it less common than malabsorption . Erythema nodosum has a variety of different causes, but is not commonly associated with systemic sclerosis. "

Assuming the healthcare worker is susceptible to hepatitis B, which of the following is the risk of transmission?", 1/3,  1/30,1/300,1/3000,1/30000,A,This is an estimated risk based on retrospective case-control studies. Evaluating risk is important when counselling a patient. The patient should be offered hepatitis B immunoglobulin and an accelerated course of hepatitis B vaccine.
immune system,275,"A 19-year-old Japanese student comes to the rheumatology clinic for review. She has suffered increasing fatigue, weight loss and low grade fevers over the last few months and is concerned that she may have an autoimmune problem. Other symptoms include dull abdominal pain after she has eaten, and problems with aching arms whilst exercising at the gym over the past few months. She has fainted on one occasion whilst painting her flat. On examination she looks pale and grey. BP is 135/90 in the right arm and 105/80 in the left arm. Heart sounds are normal and the chest is clear. Abdomen is soft and non-tender, her BMI is 21. When you ask her to hold her hands above her head, the radial pulse becomes absent in the left arm and is barely palpable in the right. There is synovitis affecting the knees and ankles. ESR and CRP are elevated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Fibromuscular dysplasia,Juvenile chronic arthritis,Kawasaki's disease,Takayasu's arteritis,Temporal arteritis,D,"The answer is Takayasu\'s arteritis. Takayasu\'s arteritis presents with non-specific symptoms of vasculitis early in the course of the disease, but later significant involvement of branches of the aorta leads to symptoms of arterial insufficiency. The subclavian artery is commonly affected, and subclavian steal syndrome can result in the symptoms described here. ESR and CRP are usually elevated, and levels of pentraxin 3 may be a useful marker of disease activity. Glucocorticoids are the mainstay of treatment, with methotrexate and azathioprine the typical first choice conventional steroid sparing agents. Fibromuscular dysplasia presents with discrete arterial disease, without the systemic features seen here, and temporal arteritis presents with headache, visual symptoms and jaw claudication. Kawasaki\'s disease is a paediatric vasculitis affecting the coronary arteries, and juvenile chronic arthritis is not associated with vascular symptoms."
immune system,276,A 70-year-old man developed acute monoarthritis of his right ankle on the second postoperative day following an elective inguinal hernia repair. He was on a diuretic for hypertension. On examination his temperature was 38°C. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute rheumatoid arthritis,Gout,Pseudogout,Septic arthritis,Traumatic synovitis,B,"The most likely diagnosis is gout, given the history of recent surgery and diuretic use. Gout is the most prevalent form of inflammatory arthropathy. It is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals with resultant inflammation in the involved joint. It typically presents with acute monoarticular pain. Current EULAR guidelines state that the rapid development of severe pain, swelling, and tenderness that reaches its maximum within 6-12 hours, especially with overlying erythema, is highly suggestive of crysal arthropathy. Involvement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint is more specific for gout, but a variety of different joints can be involved. 50% of all attacks and 70% of first attacks of gout affect the first metatarsophalangeal joint. In addition to joint symptoms, fever and malaise are common presenting features of an acute attack of gout. Acute gout can be a cause of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) which is two or more changes of body temperature, heart rate, respiratory function, and peripheral leukocyte count. There is a florid synovitis, with swelling and overlying erythema. Palpation is exquisitely painful. Untreated, the attack resolves spontaneously over 5-15days with itching and desquamation of the overlying skin. The EULAR guidelines conclude that for typical presentations of gout a clinical diagnosis alone is reasonably accurate but not definitive without visualisation of crystals on microscopy. Pyrophoshate arthropathy is less common, associated with deposition of calcium pyrophospate crystals chiefly in the knees, second and third metacarpophalangeal joints. There may be a history of haemochromatosis or osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis most commonly manifests as a chronic polyarthritis and synovitis. Septicaemia following an elective hernia repair would be uncommon as would traumatic synovitis. Examination of joint aspirate is always important however, to exclude septic arthritis as missing this diagnosis is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Although not needed to answer this question, it is important you also understand how to manage an acute episode of gout. The principles are:  commence anti-inflammatory medication immediately, and continue for two weeks - NSAIDs are first line in conjunction with gastro-protective medication where indicated; colchicine is an alternative but is slower to work and can be associated with significant diarrhoea rest the affected joints allopurinol should not be started during an acute attack but in patients already established on allopurinol it should be continued if diuretics are being used to treat hypertension an alternative antihypertensive should be considered, but they should not be stopped in the presence of heart failure corticosteroids are highly effective, and can be used where NSAIDs are not tolerated, or in refractory disease (intra-articular, oral, intramuscular, intravenous).

immune system,277,"A 65-year-old man who has recently fractured his left femur presents with thirst, headache and lower back pain. Blood tests reveal a haemoglobin of 82 g/L and corrected calcium of 2.89 mmol/L. Radiographs revealed lytic lesions in the vertebrae and skull. Which of the following is least likely to be present in this patient?",Bence Jones protein,Decreased resistance to infection,Infiltration of flat bones by plasma cells,Macroglobulinaemia,Monoclonal gammopathy ,D,"This gentleman presents with the classic symptoms of multiple myeloma: bone pain, pathological fracture, anaemia and hypercalcaemia (leading to thirst). Multiple myeloma is a relatively common malignany that is part of a spectrum of disorders ranging from monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS) to plasma cell leukaemias. It is characterised by a proliferation of malignant plasma cells involving more than 10% of the bone marrow, and a subsequence excess of monoclonal paraprotein. Additional presenting features include hyperviscosity (confusion, hazy vision), peripheral neuropathies, bleeding and spinal cord compression. The four incorrect answers here are typical features of multiple myeloma. Bones commonly affected are the flat bones of the spine, and as such lower back pain is one of the most common presenting features. The aberrant antibodies that are produced lead to impaired humoral immunity, often compounded by leucopenia secondary to bone marrow infiltration. Patients therefore have a high prevalence of infection, especially with encapsulated organisms such as Pneumococcus. Lambda light chains are secreted in the urine as Bence Jones protein. This is most accurately detected by urine protein electrophoresis. Immunofixation allows confirmation of the monoclonal nature of the light chains. Gammopathy is a disturbance in the synthesis of immunoglobulins. Monoclonal gammopathy suggests there is a single neoplastic clone causing an excess of immunoglobulin, as is the case in multiple myeloma. An important differential diagnosis to be aware of is monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). Macroglobulins are plasma globulins of high molecular weight. They are a central feature of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinaemia, where proliferation of lymphocytes cause an excess of IgM. This is an important differential diagnosis when multiple myeloma is suspected. Macroglobulins are not typically a feature of multiple myeloma."

Th1 is suppressed in pregnancy. Th2 increases Th1 produces cytokines TNF-alpha, IFN-y and IL-2 Th2 produce cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10 and IL-13In mouse studies IL-3 and IL-10 enhanced fetal survival and promote intrauterine growth while TNF-alpha, IFN-y and IL-2 had damaging effects in some cases resulting in fetal death Reproductive Immunology Immune Tolerance in PregnancyThe fetus can be considered an allograft with antigenically different material to the mother. A number of mechanisms therefore need to be in place to prevent 'graft rejection' in the form of the mother mounting an immune response against the foetus. The placenta plays a key role herePlacentaImmunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an immunologically privileged site i.e. able to tolerate foreign antigens without provocation of immune response. A number of mechanisms help achieve this:1. MHC (HLA complex) Antigen ExpressionIt has been shown that differences between class 1 and class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens are the basis for transplant rejection. In Trophoblast cells MHC class II antigens are not presented. HLA genes can be classes as 1a (HLA-A, -B, and -C) or 1b (HLA-E, -F, and -G) In trophoblast cells only HLA-C is expressed from the 1a group along with all three types of 1b genes. It has been shown that HLA-G in particular has several roles in immune suppression such as reduction of NK cell killing activity, reduction of IFN-y production, regulation of cytokine production and suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing activity and T-helper activity.2. Complement Protein InhibitionDAF, MCP and CD59 are proteins expressed by the placenta that inhibit complement proteins. Complement is an important part of the immune system in graft rejections.3.T-cells/T-helper cellsChanges to both the cell populations occur during pregnancy. Increased T regulatory cell (TREG cell) populations occur in pregnancy. These cells can both up and down regulate various immune responses.

They have Rhesus antigens and the anti-D would result in maternal blood being bound and removed from her circulation. The danger is to children born to mothers who are rhesus negative. As the mother may develop antibodies against Rhesus positive fetal blood. Therefore if the baby is Rhesus negative then there is no risk of alloimmunisaton (sensitisation) Isoimmunisation Rhesus Isoimmunisation Key PointsRefers to immune response when a women who does not have rhesus antigens on her red cells (Rhesus negative) is exposed to red cells that have the Rhesus antigen (Rhesus positive) Occurs when father of fetus is rhesus positive resulting in the fetus having Rhesus positive blood Once sensitised the mother may develop antibodies (IgG) to the fetal blood which can cross the placenta Antibody reaction can lead to mild anaemia, haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN ) or even fetal death Typically occurs in pregnancy subsequent to the one where the mother becomes sensitised Rho(D) immune globulin or Anti-D is a solution of IgG antibodies that can bind to any Rh positive blood that may have entered the maternal blood stream and prevent a maternal immune reaction The use of anti-D has reduced the risk of allommunisation of Rh negative mothers from 16% to less than 0.1%.Anti-D Ig Key Points from BCSH Guidelines*All RhD negative pregnant women who have not been previously sensitised should be offered routine antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D Ig (RAADP) either with a single dose regimen at around 28 weeks, or two-dose regimen given at 28 and 34 weeks Following birth, ABO and Rh D typing should be performed on cord blood and if the baby is confirmed to be D positive, all D negative, previously non-sensitised, women should be offered at least 500 IU of anti-D Ig within 72h following delivery. Maternal samples should be tested for FMH and additional dose(s) given as guided by FMH tests Following potentially sensitising events, anti-D Ig should be administered as soon as possible and always within 72h of the event. If, exceptionally, this deadline has not been met some protection may be offered if anti-D Ig is given up to 10 days after the sensitising event In pregnanciesFor potentially sensitising events between 12 and 20 weeks gestation, a minimum dose of 250 IU should be administered within 72h of the event.

Routine bloods reveal an increased white cell count, marked elevation in C reactive protein (CRP) and slightly elevated creatinine. Which of the following complement deficiencies is most likely to be identified?",C1 inhibitor,C2,C3,C4,C5,E,"The answer is C5. Complement deficiencies may comprise up to 10% of all primary immune disorders in some populations. Components C5 to C9 comprise the membrane attack complex, and it is deficiencies of these components which predispose to bacterial infection. With respect to N. meningitidis, rates of infection approach 66% in patients with C5-C9 deficiencies, and recurrence is as high as 50%. In patients with C5 to C9 complement deficiencies, vaccination for meningococcus, pneumococcus, and haemophilus is essential. C1 inhibitor deficiency is responsible for hereditary angioedema. C2 and C3 deficiencies present with very significant infections in infancy, C2 and C4 deficiencies are associated with early onset/increased risk of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and mutations in the C3 gene are also associated with increased risk of glomerulonephritis."

GCA affects large and medium sized arteries, with a predilection for the external carotid, ciliary and retinal arteries. Endovascular damage and cytokine-mediated inflammation causes local ischaemia. There is considerable overlap with polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms of both should be sought. 20% of patients develop loss of vision, which can be prevented with timely recognition and treatment. Visual loss typically occurs early in the course of disease and, once established, rarely improves. The classically described jaw claudication occurs in a minority of cases, but does indicate a high risk of ischaemic complications. The typical presentation of GCA is a temporal headache, with myalgia, malaise and fever. ESR and CRP are usually raised. As soon as the diagnosis is suspected, high dose corticosteroids should be given. Current BSR guidelines recommend:  Uncomplicated GCA (no jaw or tongue claudication, or visual symptoms)  prednisolone 40-60 mg daily   Complicated GCA:  Evolving visual loss or history of amaurosis fugax: IV methylprednisolone 500mg-1g daily for three days, followed by oral corticosteroids Established visual loss: at least 60 mg prednisolone daily    Bone protection and proton-pump inhibitors should be co-prescribed. It is important to note that the pathological findings of giant cell arteritis persist for one to two weeks following initiation of corticosteroid, and therefore treatment should not be delayed to obtain a biopsy. Aspirin 75 mg once daily is sometimes given as an adjunct but higher doses are not recommended. Symptoms usually resolve quickly, often with two or three days. Once they and laboratory abnormalities resolve, the dose of corticosteroid can be reduced and usually stopped within two years.

immune system,298,A man in his 20s begins to note persistent lower back pain and stiffness that diminishes with activity. In his 30s he also develops hip and shoulder arthritis and in his 40s he is bothered by decreased lumbar spine mobility. He has no other major medical problems. For which of the following are these findings most typical?,Ankylosing spondylitis,Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease,Lyme disease,Osteoarthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,A,"The combination of lower back pain, stiffness and reduced spinal mobility makes ankylosing spondylitis the most likely diagnosis here. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, potentially disabling, form of seronegative spondyloarthropathy which primarily involves the axial skeleton. The aetiology is not clearly understood, but it involves the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. The pathology mainly affects the entheses, where ligaments, tendons and capsules are attached to the bone. Current British Society for Rheumatology recommendations state that the modified New York criteria should be used to diagnose ankylosing spondylitis: Clinical criteria:  Low back pain, present for more than three months, improved by exercise but not relieved by rest Limitation of lumbar spine motion in both the sagittal and frontal planes Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values for age and sex.  Radiological criteria:  Sacroiliitis on x ray.  Diagnosis:  Definite AS if the radiological criterion is present plus at least one clinical criterion Probable AS if three clinical criteria are present alone or if the radiological criterion is present but no clinicial criteria are present.  It is widely accepted that making the diagnosis early is difficult because the onset is insidious, and there is no definitive diagnostic test. One study has stated that the average time from onset to diagnosis ranges from 3-11 years. Timely diagnosis therefore requires a high index of suspicion. HLA-B27 is found in 90% patients with AS but also in 8% of the general population and therefore should not be relied upon in making a diagnosis. MRI can visualise sacroiliitis in patients with typical symptoms of AS but normal radiographs, and it is evolving as the most important diagnostic imaging tool in early disease. However, as yet a diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis cannot be made on MRI findings alone and these cases are currently termed non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA). Both HLA-B27 and sacroiliitis on MRI play a major role in the recently proposed Assessment of Spondylo-Arthritis International Society (ASAS) diagnostic algorithm. This may replace the modified New York criteria in the future. An x ray of the lumbar spine may show bridging syndesmophytes between the vertebral bodies in keeping with ankylosing spondylitis but this is not part of the diagnostic criteria, and it is a late sign. Radiographic sacroiliitis is a requirement for patients to be eligible for anti-TNF treatment for AS. The sacroiliitis is usually bilateral and symmetrical. It progresses from blurring of the subchondral bone plate to irregular erosions of the margins of the sacroiliac joints to sclerosis, narrowing, and finally fusion. Erosions of the sacroiliac joint are generally seen earlier in the lower portion due to its synovial lining, and on the iliac side due to the thinner cartilage covering this side of the joint. Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition is the pathological basis of pseudogout, which typically presents as acute monoarthritis of the peripheral joints. It is not typically associated with spinal disease, and would be unusual in some one of this age. Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, which classically presents with fever and erythema migrans following a tick bite in an endemic area (for example, the New Forest). Without treatment, it can progress to disseminated disease with a polyarticular arthritis but persistent back pain and stiffness is not usual. Osteoarthritis can affect the lumbar spine with similar symptoms to those described above, but is very uncommon in patients in their twenties. Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the small joints of the hands, and cervical spine involvement is more common than lumbar disease. "
immune system,299,"A 52-year-old woman presents with a two week history of malaise and lower limb joint pain, associated with a vasculitic rash over her shins, thighs and buttocks.

HSP is a small vessel vasculitis mediated by IgA-immune complex deposition. It is characterised by the tetrad of:  purpura abdominal pain arthritis, and renal involvement (haematuria and proteinuria).  The diagnosis can be easily missed, and a high degree of suspicion is required. Skin biopsy and immunofluorescence demonstrate leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition, which is pathognomonic for HSP. 90% of cases of HSP occur in children aged 2-10 years but can occur in any age group. It is typically commoner in males, and may follow an infectious agent. An important risk factor for the development of HSP in adults is thought to be chronic alcohol intake. A variety of disorders have been associated with HSP in adults, including Helicobacter pylori, hepatitis B and malignancy. In some cases, overlap with polyangiitis or polyarteritis-like disease is seen. Management of HSP in adults often involves the use of immunomodulatory or immune-suppressive regiments (in contrast to children where the majority of cases resolve spontaneously). There is often a more complicated course in adults, and 50% of patients who present with renal involvement develop renal insufficiency. In addition to renal disease, cardiac, pulmonary, ocular, gastrointestinal and neurological complications have been described. Amyloidosis is a clinical disorder caused by extracellular and or intracellular deposition of insoluble abnormal amyloid fibrils, which alter normal tissue function. It is classified chemically and is associated with a number of different conditions. There is typically a combination of symptoms which affect more than one system, including massive proteinuria, peripheral neuropathy, hepatomegaly and heart failure. A vasculitic rash affecting the lower limbs is not typical. Haemolytic ueaemic syndrome (HUS) is a triad of microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure. It is most commonly associated with Escherichia coli O157:H7. The classical presentation is profuse diarrhoea with blood, and the absence of this in the above scenario makes HUS unlikely. Membranous nephropathy is a histological diagnosis and usually presents with proteinuria without haematuria. 85% of cases are idiopathic, and the remainder are secondary to autoimmune conditions (SLE), infection (hepatitis B), drugs (captopril, NSAIDs) and malignancy. In myeloma there is malignant proliferation of plasma cells, which produces marrow infiltration and overproduction of a monoclonal antibody detectable in serum and/or urine (Bence Jones protein). Common presenting features include pathological fractures, anaemia, anorexia, bruising and infection. Myeloma can rarely cause vasculitis which is antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) negative but this is rare and less likely than HSP in this scenario. "

She appears unwell, with a swinging fever, 3 kg weight loss over two months, generalised myalgia, polyarthralgia affecting wrists, knees, ankles, elbows and metacarpophalangeal joints, and a sore throat. Investigations demonstrate normochromic normocytic anaemia 98 g/L, ESR 81 mm in the first hour, CRP 31 g/L, serum ferritin 1756 mg/dL, RF negative, ANA negative, ENA negative, ASO titre less than200 IU. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Adult onset Still's disease (AOSD),Polymyositis,Rheumatic fever,Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,A,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is adult onset Still's disease. This is a rare systemic inflammatory disease characterised by high spiking fever, evanescent salmon pink rash, polyarthralgia, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and neutrophilic leucocytosis. There is often an accompanying sore throat and myalgia. The fever occurs once or twice daily and is described as quotidian or diquotidian returning to 37°C or below between episodes. The characteristic evanescent salmon-coloured non-pruritic macular or macular-papular rash occurs in approximately 90% of patients and is often seen only when the patient is febrile and is easily missed. Aetiology is not clearly understood, but it is likely triggered by an infectious agent in a genetically predisposed host. Diagnosis is clinical, and should include exclusion of infectious disease, neoplasms and other autoimmune disease. Laboratory tests reflect systemic inflammation, with a high ESR, leucocytosis and raised acute phase reactants (in particular ferritin). Rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody are typically negative. Liver function tests can be abnormal. High serum ferritin, with low glycosylated fraction, are characteristic and can be used as disease activity markers. Interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-18, macrophage colony stimulating factor, interferon gamma and TNF-alpha are all elevated. The clinical course can be divided into:  Self-limited or monophasic intermittent Polycyclic systemic, and Chronic articular pattern.  Prognosis tends to be better when systemic symptoms predominate. Therapy includes non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and biological agents. Intravenous immunoglobulin may have a role. Polymyositis is an inflammatory condition which typically presents with relatively painless, progressive, proximal muscle weakness. Rheumatic fever develops in relation to group A streptococcal infection. It presents with chorea, carditis, subcutaneous nodules, erythema marginatum and migratory polyarthritis. Systemic upset to the extent described in the above case is unusual with rheumatoid arthritis. One would expect ANA to be positive in systemic lupus erythematosus. "

His CK is elevated at 1200. Which of the following antibodies is most likely to be elevated?",Anti-Jo antibody,Anti-La antibody,Anti-signal recognition particle antibody,Anti-Rho antibody,Anti-smooth muscle antibody,A,"The proximal myopathy and raised creatine kinase (CK) in the absence of a violaceous rash suggests that polymyositis is the most likely diagnosis. Around 20% of patients with polymyositis have anti-Jo 1 antibodies. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of immunosuppression. Patients with anti-Jo 1 antibodies are at increased risk of lung fibrosis, and therefore immunosuppression is usually continued long term. A steroid sparing agent, such as azathioprine, may well be added to reduce the corticosteroid dose. There are a variety of other autoantibodies present in polymyositis, including anti-signal recognition particle antibody, which can be associated with different forms of the disease.  Anti-Rho and -La antibodies are seen in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and are associated with the development of neonatal lupus.

The right knee is warm, tender, and there is a tense right knee effusion. Knee flexion is painful and restricted. Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",Aspirate right knee,Blood culture,CRP,MRI right knee,Serum urate,A,"Septic arthritis must be excluded in an individual with acute mono-arthritis. Septic arthritis may be oligo- or polyarticular in the immunosuppressed, and may present without pyrexia. Joint aspiration, followed by microscopy and culture of the synovial fluid is critical to the diagnosis of septic arthritis. Examination of joint fluid under polarised microscope may show monosodium urate (negatively birefringent) or calcium pyrophosphate (weakly positively birefringent) crystals, and lead to a diagnosis of acute gout or acute CPP crystal arthritis (pseudogout). Knee radiograph is likely to be normal in someone with inflammatory joint symptoms of short duration. A blood culture may be negative in over half of patients with septic arthritis, and a high CRP does not differentiate between causes of acute hot swollen joint. Knee MRI will show a wide range of non-specific changes in this scenario, for example, effusion, synovial proliferation, bone marrow oedema, none of which is specific to septic arthritis. There is no role for serum urate in the diagnosis of acute gout. Serum urate, a negative acute phase reactant (like albumin), reduces during an acute illness."

immune system,307,The Mantoux reaction is an example of which type of hypersensitivity reaction?,Humoral immune response,Type I hypersensitivity ,Type II hypersensitivity,Type III hypersensitivity,Type IV hypersensitivity,E,"The tuberculin skin test is an example of a type IV hypersensitivity or a delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction. This reaction develops when primed Th1 cells encounter their specific antigen. An inflammatory response evolves over 24-72 hours. In the tuberculin skin test, the injected antigen is protein derived from M. tuberculosis. Th1 cells recognise peptide bound to major histocompatibility complex on APCs and are activated to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL2), interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), chemokines, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). There is recruitment of inflammatory cells, predominantly macrophages, to the site of antigen deposition with activation of phagocytes. Some cytokines (TNF) as well as macrophage derived lytic enzymes cause local tissue destruction. CD8+ T-cells have also been implicated in DTH responses. The result is an indurated erythematous lesion at the site of injection which indicates previous exposure to TB."

Maternal samples should be tested for FMH and additional dose(s) given as guided by FMH tests Following potentially sensitising events, anti-D Ig should be administered as soon as possible and always within 72h of the event. If, exceptionally, this deadline has not been met some protection may be offered if anti-D Ig is given up to 10 days after the sensitising event In pregnanciesFor potentially sensitising events between 12 and 20 weeks gestation, a minimum dose of 250 IU should be administered within 72h of the event.

There is no peripheral adenopathy nor abnormal enlargement of an organ (organomegaly). A chest x ray showed bilateral hilar adenopathy and a CT guided biopsy of the mediastinal lymph nodes was performed. This showed chronic inflammation with multiple non-caseating granulomas. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Histoplasmosis,HIV,Lymphoma,Sarcoidosis,Tuberculosis,D,"The presence of bilateral hilar adenopathy in someone with erythema nodosum-like lesions, fever and weight loss suggests the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that commonly presents with pulmonary involvement. It is diagnosed on the basis of clinical and radiological manifestations, which can be supported by histiological demonstration of non-caseating granulomas in biopsy tissue. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is a classical feature demonstrated on chest radiograph. The aetiology of sarcoidosis is still not fully understood but may include exposure to an environmental antigen in combination with a genetic predisposition. Traditionally pulmonary involvement is classified in to five stages based on chest radiograph findings:  Stage 0 - normal chest radiograph Stage 1 - bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) Stage 2 - BHL with pulmonary infiltrates Stage 3 - parenchymal infiltrates without hilar lymphadenopathy Stage 4 - pulmonary fibrosis (volume loss) +/- cavitations, calcifications, bullae.  Treatment of sarcoidosis is symptomatic and the mainstay remains oral corticosteroids. These should be continued for 12 months and the dose tapered to stop within two years maximum. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of immunosuppressants routinely. Methotrexate and azathioprine can be used in refractory cases. Surgical intervention can be considered in severe cases. Cutaneous disease typically responds to oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory treatment. Differential diagnosis of bilateral hilar adenopathy includes:  Sarcoidosis Lymphoma Tuberculosis Pneumoconiosis Berylliosis, and Fungal diseases like histoplasmosis.  Ninety per cent of people infected with histoplasma are asymptomatic. If symptoms are present they typically commence within three to 10 days of exposure, and consist of fever, headache and malaise. HIV has a variety of clinical manifestations often due to opportunistic infection, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Biopsy of lymphoma would be expected to demonstrate malignant cells. Tuberculosis is an important differential diagnosis, but histology is typically caseating granulomas. "

They contain storage granules that contain lytic enzymes (for example, tryptase) and inflammatory mediators, for example:  Histamine Heparin 5-Tryptase hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) Leukotrienes Platelet aggregating factor Leukocyte chemotactic factor Hyaluronidase.  Release of these mediators occurs during mast cell degranulation, which can be triggered by:  tissue injury drugs complement activation, or foreign antigenic material.  An anaphylactic reaction occurs when a previously sensitised individual is re-exposed to the antigen. It is an IgE mediated immune response. Mastocytosis occurs when excess mast cells are present in the circulation or as tissue infiltrates."

A number of mechanisms therefore need to be in place to prevent 'graft rejection' in the form of the mother mounting an immune response against the foetus. The placenta plays a key role herePlacentaImmunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an immunologically privileged site i.e. able to tolerate foreign antigens without provocation of immune response. A number of mechanisms help achieve this:1. MHC (HLA complex) Antigen ExpressionIt has been shown that differences between class 1 and class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens are the basis for transplant rejection. In Trophoblast cells MHC class II antigens are not presented. HLA genes can be classes as 1a (HLA-A, -B, and -C) or 1b (HLA-E, -F, and -G) In trophoblast cells only HLA-C is expressed from the 1a group along with all three types of 1b genes. It has been shown that HLA-G in particular has several roles in immune suppression such as reduction of NK cell killing activity, reduction of IFN-y production, regulation of cytokine production and suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing activity and T-helper activity.2. Complement Protein InhibitionDAF, MCP and CD59 are proteins expressed by the placenta that inhibit complement proteins. Complement is an important part of the immune system in graft rejections.3.T-cells/T-helper cellsChanges to both the cell populations occur during pregnancy. Increased T regulatory cell (TREG cell) populations occur in pregnancy. These cells can both up and down regulate various immune responses. Th2 levels increase during pregnancy Th1 levels decrease during pregnancy4. PhosphocholinationThe addition of the phosphocholine molecule to glycoproteins inhibits T and B lymphocyte responses. It is a mechanism used by some parasites5. PDL1Cell signalling molecule that down regulates T-cell response6. ProgesteroneThought to play a role in immune suppression by stimulating lymphocytes to produce a blocking factor that mediates cytokine production.Other mechanismsPlacental exosomes, retroviral envelope proteins and CRH may all play a role in maternal immune tolerance but this level of detail is unlikely to be required by the MRCOG"

Despite confounders in the history (alcohol use suggesting gout, nail pitting highlighting the possibility of psoriasis) a destructive septic arthritis is a potential diagnosis and it must be excluded as a matter of urgency. Although serum WCC is usually raised in systemic infection it is not necessarily always raised in a localised infection such as septic arthritis, especially early in the disease course. Checking rheumatoid factor, anticyclic citrullinated peptide antibody and knee radiograph is incorrect in this instance. This not a typical history of rheumatoid arthritis and waiting for immunological investigation prior to initiating treatment is not appropriate. A radiograph may be appropriate, but in the acute stages of septic arthritis it may be normal. Commencing allopurinol is incorrect. This may be gout, but septic arthritis requires urgent orthopaedic management and you need a joint aspirate to exclude it prior to starting treatment for another condition. Commencing NSAID is incorrect. Whilst analgesia is appropriate, alone it risks missing a serious diagnosis. Commencing oral steroids and a DMARD is incorrect. A diagnosis needs to be made prior to commencing such medications. These are used in rheumatoid arthritis which is unlikely to be the diagnosis in this case. Joint aspirate is the most crucial step in excluding a septic arthritis, and allows the timely commencement of surgical management and appropriate antibiotics."

immune system,321,"A 37-year-old carpenter comes to the rheumatology clinic complaining of pain going from the lateral aspect of his elbow and down his forearm. He has been recently working excessive overtime on a housing project. On examination he has pain on palpation over the lateral aspect of the humerus, and on resisted dorsiflexion of the wrist. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Carpal tunnel syndrome,Cervical nerve root entrapment,Lateral epicondylitis,Olecranon bursitis,Osteoarthritis of the elbow,C,"This patient has symptoms that are consistent with tennis elbow (lateral epicondylitis), most probably due to excessive forearm extension as a result of his work as a carpenter. Lateral epicondylitis occurs due to inflammation of the extensor forearm muscle origins, and causes lateral elbow and upper forearm pain and tenderness. On examination, patients have pain and tenderness over the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, radiating into the forearm and pain on resisted dorsiflexion of the wrist and middle finger. Pain is exacerbated by active and resisted movements of the extensor muscles of the forearm. Lateral epicondylitis is a self-limiting condition, and usually resolves within 6 months to 2 years. Whilst awaiting for resolution rest, ice, activity restriction and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs can reduce symptoms. Physiotherapy has been shown to be beneficial. Steroids injections have been shown to be harmful in the long-term and are therefore not recommended. Glyceryl trinitrate patches over the painful area do improve outcome."
immune system,322,"A lady known to have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) delivers her baby at 37 weeks. At the initial newborn check, the baby appears to have a scaly red rash and to be bradycardic. An ECG shows complete heart block. Which antibodies are most likely to be responsible for these findings?",Anti-Jo1,Anti-La,Anti-Ro,dsDNA,pANCA,C,"Anti-Ro antibodies from a mother with SLE can cause fetal heart block as part of neonatal lupus. It affects only 3-5% of babies born to mothers with SLE, and the most common cause of heart block is anti-Ro antibodies. Anti-La antibodies are also a cause of fetal heart block, but less commonly than anti-Ro. dsDNA is used as a marker of disease activity in Lupus, but is not associated with neonatal heart block. pANCA is common in a number of vasculitides but is not specific to neonatal lupus. Anti-Jo1 antiboides are associated with dermatomyositis and polymyositis."

immune system,327,"You are reviewing a 42-year-old woman in clinic. She was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis last year after presenting with small hand joint synovitis and stiffness. At that time her rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP levels were 1:20 titre and 700 U/ml respectively. Unfortunately, despite 12 months on a combination of prednisolone, methotrexate and leflunomide, she still has moderate disease activity based on a DAS-28 (disease activity score) score of 3.2. She is being considered for etanercept. Preliminary tests demonstrate a normal chest radiograph, but positive QuantiFERON test. She is asymptomatic. From the following options, which is the most appropriate treatment?",Consider infliximab as an alternative,Hold etanercept until treatment is completed for active TB,Prescribe etanercept and monitor closely,Prescribe etanercept with TB prophylaxis,None of the above,D,"It is important to be aware of the following teaching points:  Recommendations for biologic therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Contraindications to biologic therapy, and Basic disease scoring in RA.  This lady has a DAS-28 score persistently greater than 3.2 and has failed on a combination of more than two disease modifying agents, thus fulfilling the criteria for consideration of anti-TNF (biologic) therapy. Patients receiving anti-TNF alpha treatment have an increased risk of clinical tuberculosis (TB) development. The current British Thoracic Society guidelines therefore recommend a clinical examination, chest radiograph and thorough history taken to check for prior TB. Any patient with an abnormal chest radiograph or previous history of TB should be referred for assessment by a specialist with an interest in TB. Those with symptoms raising a suspicion of TB should be thoroughly investigated to exclude active disease. Any patient with active TB, either pulmonary or non-pulmonary, should receive standard chemotherapy. They must complete two months full treatment before starting anti-TNF alpha treatment. Patients with an abnormal chest radiograph consistent with past TB, or a history or prior extrapulmonary TB but who have received previous adequate therapy can be started on anti-TNF alpha therapy but need to be monitored regularly. Where there is an abnormal chest radiograph, or a history of prior pulmonary or extrapulmonary TB not previously adequately treated, chemoprophylaxis should be given before commencing anti-TNF alpha treatment. For patients with a normal chest radiograph who have not started immunosuppressive threrapy, a tuberculin test is helpful. If a patient is already on immunosuppressive treatment, the result of the tuberculin test is dampened and it is therefore not useful. An individual risk assessment should be made: if the annual risk of TB is greater than that of drug-induced hepatitis then chemoprophylaxis should be given. If not, the patient should be monitored and investigated early if symptoms consistent with TB develop. Chemoprophylaxis is generally with isoniazid for 6 months. The BTS guidelines have not been updated to include recommendations regarding Quantiferon and Elispot tests. Practice does vary between individual NHS trusts regarding who to test with one of these, and which to use. However, the most accepted recommendations are that patients who test positive with either of these should be treated with chemoprophylaxis (either isoniazid for 6 months, or dual therapy for two months) at the same time as being started on anti-TNF alpha treatment.

SAPHO is an acronym for synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. It is characterised by osteosclerotic bone lesions, sterile osteomyelitis, and a variety of skin lesions.  Synovitis - may be present rarely, and associates with erosions. Acne - may be severe (conglobate or fulminans) and recur with new bony involvement. Pustulosis - palmo-plantar pustulosis occurs in approximately 50% of patients, other skin lesions may include psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, and rarely Sweet's syndrome. Hyperostosis (increase in bone substance) and osteitis (inflammation of the bones) - the bony lesions typically involve the acromioclavicular, and sternoclavicular joints. Other sites include anterior chest wall, sternum, clavicle, pubic symphysis, spine, and mandible. These lesions are visualised on 99m technetium bone scan or MRI.  The cause of the SAPHO syndrome is unknown. The skin lesions are characterised by neutrophilic pseudoabscesses. Bone biopsy can reveal sterile osteomyelitis. Diagnosis should be suspected when there is an association of rheumatic pain with a pustular skin disease. SAPHO has no specific treatment, and some cases remit spontaneously. Typical treatment can be used for the arthritic symptoms (i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatories and disease modifying anti-rheumatic agents). Isotretinoin and aciretin can be used to treat the skin disease. In the more severe cases corticosteroids, calcitonin, bisphosphonates and TNF-inhibitors can be used."

It is a simple procedure with a high diagnostic yield. A destructive septic arthritis is a potential diagnosis and it must be excluded as a matter of urgency. Joint aspirate is the most crucial step in excluding a septic arthritis, and allows the timely commencement of surgical management and appropriate antibiotics. Sending the joint aspiration for M/C/S in a blood culture bottle may increase yield. Whilst joint washout is appropriate management of septic arthritis, a diagnosis must be made prior to this being considered. The risk of introducing infection into the knee joint during simple aspiration by non-experts is 1 in 10,000 procedures, so the procedure is safe."

immune system,345,A 30-year-old woman presents with Raynaud's phenomenon. Which one of the following clinical features suggests an underlying connective tissue disease?,Episodes lasting in excess of one hour,Involvement of toes ,One previous miscarriage in early pregnancy ,Symmetrical involvement of fingers ,Symptoms developed as a teenager,A,"Raynaud's phenomenon is a common clinical presentation, which may be primary or secondary to underlying disease. It can be diagnosed if there is a history of clearly demarcated pallor of the digit(s) followed by at least one other colour change (cyanosis and/or erythema). Symptoms are usually precipitated by cold (or less commonly emotion). Vasospasm without endothelial damage is thought to be the main cause for primary RP. The pathogenesis of secondary forms is probably initiated primarily by endothelial damage. Physical examination, nailfold capillaroscopy and immunological tests can differentiate between primary and secondary Raynaud's. You should suspect secondary Raynaud's phenomenon if any of the following are present:  Onset at more than 30 years of age Intense, painful or asymmetrical episodes Presence of additional clinical features suggestive of underlying disease Positive anti-nuclear antibody Abnormal nail-fold capillaries Digital ulcers, gangrene or severe ischaemia of one or more digits.  Primary Raynaud's can be diagnosed if all the following are present:  No suspicion of underlying disease Symmetrical episodes affecting both hands, but not necessarily all fingers No tissue necrosis, ulceration, gangrene or severe ischaemia Normal nail-fold capillaries Normal ESR and negative anti-nuclear antibodies.  Treatment involves prevention so that permanent ischaemic damage can be avoided. Patients should avoid exposure to the cold. The mild forms of primary RP can be controlled by non-pharmacological approaches alone. If insufficient, the first choice therapy is calcium channel blockers. In severe forms, intravenous prostaglandin, endothelin-1 receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors are used. Future treatment options may include selective alpha-2c adrenergic receptor blockers, tyrosine and Rho-kinase inhibitors and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Differential diagnosis of Raynaud's phenomenon includes:  Chilblains (perniosis): erythematous itchy swellings on fingers and toes in response to cold Acrocyanosis: continuous blueness of the extremities aggravated by cold Erythromelalgia: painful erythema caused by paroxysmal dilatation of blood vessels Vascular embolism Livedo reticularis Mottled, cyanotic discolouration of skin.  Whilst it is not a strict criteria given in the current guidance, it is recognised that episodes do tend to be longer in secondary Raynaud's. Episodes typically terminate within 15 minutes following warming in primary disease, but can often be prolonged in secondary disease. All the other features described here would be consistent with a diagnosis of primary Raynaud's disease. Whilst miscarriage can be associated with connective tissue disease, in particular antiphospholipid syndrome, it is common in the population especially in early pregnancy. "

Investigations show:    ESR 40 mm/hr (0-10)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute exacerbation of osteoarthritis ,Psoriatic arthropathy,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic lupus erythematosus ,B,"This woman has psoriatic arthritis. Synovitis is indicative of an inflammatory arthritis. The rash typically pre-dates the arthropathy by a number of years, but the opposite can be true. Small plaques should be looked for on the elbows and scalp. There are five patterns of disease:  Symmetrical polyarthritis ('rheumatoid pattern') - affects wrists, hands, feet and ankles. The distal interphalangeal joints are more commonly affected than the metacarpophalangeal joints, which helps to distinguish it from rheumatoid arthritis. Asymmetrical oligoarticular arthritis - dactylitis. Distal interphalangeal joint disease - typically in men. Arthritis mutilans - rare. Spondylitis pattern with sacroileitis.  Rheumatoid arthritis typically affects the metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints symmetrically. Psoriatic arthritis affects the distal interphalangeal joints and tends to be asymmetrical. Joint involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus occurs in the form of a polyarticular arthralgia, frequently symmetrical and episodic. Intense tendonitis is more common than synovitis and can lead to deforming reversible subluxation of joints without erosive disease (Jaccoud's arthropathy). Osteoarthritis would be unusual in someone of this age group. Reactive arthritis is a sterile inflammatory arthritis which develops as a sequel to remote infection, usually of the gastrointestinal or urogenital tract. There is no history of such infection in this case. It also classically presents as a large joint oligoarthritis."

The HPA recommends screening for HBsAg in all pregnant women, and all babies of seropositive women should be immunised. This is given as soon as possible after birth, then at 1, 2 and 12 months of age. Hepatitis B immunoglobulin is recommended to all 'high-risk' infants. This should be given as soon as possible after birth, no later than 48 hours. Infants considered to be 'high-risk' are those born to mothers who are HbeAg positive, or e markers are not available, or those who have had acute hepatitis B in pregnancy. Infants born weighing less than 1500 g are also considered high-risk. should also be administered only if the neonate has a low birth weight or the mother is a chronic carrier of high infectivity (hepatitis B eAg positive).

If IBD is inactive, the risk of relapse is the same as for non-pregnant women, which is approximately a 30% chance of flare over a year. Reproductive Immunology Immune Tolerance in PregnancyThe fetus can be considered an allograft with antigenically different material to the mother. A number of mechanisms therefore need to be in place to prevent 'graft rejection' in the form of the mother mounting an immune response against the foetus. The placenta plays a key role herePlacentaImmunological barrier between the mother and the fetus, creating an immunologically privileged site i.e. able to tolerate foreign antigens without provocation of immune response. A number of mechanisms help achieve this:1. MHC (HLA complex) Antigen ExpressionIt has been shown that differences between class 1 and class II Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) antigens are the basis for transplant rejection. In Trophoblast cells MHC class II antigens are not presented. HLA genes can be classes as 1a (HLA-A, -B, and -C) or 1b (HLA-E, -F, and -G) In trophoblast cells only HLA-C is expressed from the 1a group along with all three types of 1b genes. It has been shown that HLA-G in particular has several roles in immune suppression such as reduction of NK cell killing activity, reduction of IFN-y production, regulation of cytokine production and suppression of cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing activity and T-helper activity.2. Complement Protein InhibitionDAF, MCP and CD59 are proteins expressed by the placenta that inhibit complement proteins. Complement is an important part of the immune system in graft rejections.3.T-cells/T-helper cellsChanges to both the cell populations occur during pregnancy. Increased T regulatory cell (TREG cell) populations occur in pregnancy. These cells can both up and down regulate various immune responses. Th2 levels increase during pregnancy Th1 levels decrease during pregnancy4. PhosphocholinationThe addition of the phosphocholine molecule to glycoproteins inhibits T and B lymphocyte responses. It is a mechanism used by some parasites5. PDL1Cell signalling molecule that down regulates T-cell response6. ProgesteroneThought to play a role in immune suppression by stimulating lymphocytes to produce a blocking factor that mediates cytokine production.Other mechanismsPlacental exosomes, retroviral envelope proteins and CRH may all play a role in maternal immune tolerance but this level of detail is unlikely to be required by the MRCOG"
immune system,352,A 68 year old male presents with leg pain on walking.  His leg feel heavy and sometimes numb.  It is worse walking down hill and is relieved when he stops and sits down. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Intermittent claudication,Lumbar disc prolapse,Spinal stenosis,Osteoarthritis,Ankylosing Spondylitis,C,"The most likely diagnosis given is spinal stenosis.  It is caused by narrowing of the spinal canal causing root ischaemia and neurogenic claudication. It is often caused by a combination of loss of disc space, osteophyte formation and a hypertrophic ligamentum flavum. There can be reduction of spinal diameter due to osteoarthritis.  An x-ray is normal and straight leg raising test is negative.  It is often exacerbated by extension of the spine and thus going downhill can be worse and when sitting down.  This is the main differentiating feature from its main differential Intermittent claudication where these features are not seen."
immune system,353,"A 45-year-old woman notices that she develops tingling and numbness over the palmar surface of her thumb, index, and middle fingers after several hours at her computer workstation doing word processing. Pain in the same area often occurs at night as well. Which of the following pathologic findings most likely accounts for her symptoms?",Gout,Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy,Entrapment neuropathy,Rheumatoid arthritis,Toxic peripheral neuropathy,C,"Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the most common entrapment neuropathies, and is a recognised occupational disease. The carpal tunnel is an anatomical compartment bounded on three sides by the carpal bones, and the transverse carpal ligament on the palmar side. Intermittent or sustained high pressure within this compartment produces ischaemia of the median nerve, resulting in the classical symptoms or paraesthesia and pain. If allowed to progress, weakness and wasting develop which eventually become irreversible. Nerve conduction studies are an important diagnostic test, and are the best predictor of symptom severity and functional status. Treatment depends on severity, and includes splinting, corticosteroid interventions or surgical decompression. In the future pulsed radio frequency may be used. Gout is caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals within a joint, leading to excruitiating pain and swelling. It is not a common cause of the symptoms described above. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy may occur secondary to primary lung carcinoma. It presents with clubbing, arthralgia, arthritis and periostosis of the tubular bones. Pain is severe and is present throughout the day. Rheumatoid arthritis is a possibility in women of this age group, but more commonly presents with swelling and pain of the small joints of the hand. Toxic neuropathy presents with weakness, sensory loss and reduced reflexes secondary to diffuse nerve damage. This can be caused by a variety of agents but is much less common than carpal tunnel syndrome, making it a less likely answer in this case. "

APAS can be diagnosed if:  the patient has anticardiolipin antibodies, or lupus anticoagulant on two occasions, over a period of 12 weeks,  and either:  has had a thrombus, or a history of recurrent less than 10 week pregnancy loss, or one pregnancy loss greater than 10 weeks in gestation when other causes of pregnancy loss have been excluded.  The occurrence of even a single thrombotic event in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome warrants lifelong anticoagulation, as the risk of recurrence is 20-70%. Low molecular weight heparin should be used initially whilst loading warfarin. In general, it is recommended that the INR is maintained above 2.0, although a higher level (above 3) may be indicated for patients with recurrent thrombosis on treatment. Anticoagulation to prevent foetal loss remains controversial. New evidence suggests the use of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixiban can be used in patients with lower risk disease. "

He is known to have a history of an acute gout episode affecting his left first MTPJ. He had recently been travelling in Europe and returned yesterday. During his trip he had had one episode of night sweats which he put down to the possibility of having caught flu, but he did mention that he had noticed feeling less fit than previously during activities. Clinically he had a low grade pyrexia of 37.7°C but was otherwise well. Blood results showed an elevated ESR 40 and CRP 15, FBC, renal profile and LFTs were otherwise unremarkable. Physical examination revealed normal abdominal, chest and cardiovascular findings. There were two patches of raised rash over his knees, which were painful. There were no features of synovitis elsewhere. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next investigation?",Ankle aspirate,Blood cultures,CXR,Serum urate,Skin biopsy,C,"This man has bilateral swollen ankles with raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and mildly raised C reactive protein (CRP), some constitutional symptoms and a rash suggestive of erythema nodosum. Sarcoidosis is therefore high on the list of differentials. The typical erythema nodosum (EN) rash consists of a sudden onset of symmetrical, tender, erythematous, warm nodules and raised plaques usually located on the shins, ankles and knees. The description above should therefore lead you to consider EN. Joint aspirate is not the next best investigation as the patient is not clinically septic and has bilateral swelling which decreases the likelihood of septic arthritis. Blood cultures are not clinically appropriate currently, as the patient is afebrile and not clinically septic. A chest x ray may show bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy to guide towards a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and is the most appropriate investigation listed here. The history is not typical of gout and urate levels will not alter treatment nor is this a diagnostic test. The results of a skin biopsy will take up to a week, and it is therefore not the most appropriate first line investigation. In general, a biopsy will only be taken if the clinical diagnosis is in doubt. If done the histopathology will show a mostly septal panniculitis, with no vasculitis. The septa of the subcutaneous fat are thickened, and variously infiltrated by inflammatory cells that extend to the periseptal areas of the fat lobules. The composition of the inflammatory infiltrate in the septa varies with the age of the lesion^1. Miescher's radial granulomas (relatively small histiocytes radially placed around a central cleft) may be present, which are a characteristic marker of erythema nodosum^2. "

Lung involvement usually causes fibrosis and hence a restrictive pattern on lung function testing. Atlanto-axial ligament laxity, together with odontoid peg erosion, may result in cervical subluxation and possible cord compression. Twenty five per cent of rheumatoid arthritis sufferers have cervical instability, but only 7% have clinical signs. Cervical spine x rays are required and a gap of more than 3 mm between the odontoid peg and the posterior arch of the axis is diagnostic of subluxation. Cricoarytenoid involvement may cause hoarseness, stridor and airway obstruction. A normochromic normocytic anaemia plus anaemia from chronic gastrointestinal loss (NSAIDs) are often found on a pre-operative FBC.

His mother states that although he had a mild coryza over the last week, he was improving and so they had gone to a children's picnic with nursery friends. Two hours ago he started coughing and spluttering, and ever since the breathing has remained noisy. He is an ex-premature baby born at 30 weeks gestation, but has attained all his milestones to date and is fully immunised. Although he appears well in the department, his current observations demonstrate a raised respiratory rate and saturations of 91% on air. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylaxis,Croup,Epiglottitis,Foreign body aspiration,Laryngomalacia,D,"Added airway sounds must always be addressed with the utmost urgency. In children stridor can be heard on both inspiration and expiration depending on the anatomical level of the pathology, but in all cases implies a compromised upper airway. It is important to emphasis that stridor is a sign and not a diagnosis, and the underlying cause must be sought urgently. As all the causes listed above can present with stridor, thus the history is paramount in helping to identify the correct precipitant. This scenario is the classic case presentation of foreign body aspiration, in which an inquisitive child, usually aged 1 to 3 years, has put an object into their mouth and inhaled it. The foreign body is now lodged within the trachea or main bronchi and obstructs airflow causing the stridor. The concern is that the airway may fully obstruct depending upon the position and lead to respiratory deterioration. The nature of onset is always abrupt and may be highlighted by a choking or vomiting episode. All cases must be referred to specialists for consideration of bronchoscopy and removal of foreign body. Anaphylaxis can also have an abrupt onset, however a more definitive precipitant such as a new food may be implicated. In children croup (viral laryngotracheitis) is the most common reason for a patient to present with stridor, with parainfluenza 1 virus being the most common precipitant. The classic 'barking cough' of croup and subsequent stridor is predominantly limited to children under the age of 12. Risk stratification can be done in these children by performing a Westley croup score to classify patients as mild, moderate or severe and to allow initiation of treatment appropriately. In this scenario, croup is a possibility however other diagnoses are more probable. Epiglottitis has now become rare in children, as the previous main precipitant of Haemophilus influenzae B is now routinely immunised against. Laryngomalacia is associated with premature babies and in the early weeks can present with stridor however with increasing age the larynx matures and stridor should settle. ENT teams will follow these patients closely and the stridor history from the parents will be a chronic one. "

Bisphosphonate therapy is relatively contraindicated however, given her history of gastric ulcer perforation and ongoing alcohol abuse. More, it is doubtful that she would comply with the special instructions relating to the administration of a bisphosphonate. For these reasons, current NICE guidance recommends denosumab^1, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the nuclear factor-kappa ligand (RANKL) involved in osteoclast activation.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Guillain-Barre syndrome,Hypothyroidism ,Myasthenia gravis ,Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR),Polymyositis ,E,"Polymyositis classically presents with relatively painless progressive proximal muscle weakness. Dysphagia is common but the ocular muscles are very rarely involved unlike myasthenia gravis where this is a predominant feature. Diagnosis of polymyositis confirmed by elevated muscle enzymes (creatine kinase) and typical EMG and muscle biopsy findings. PMR is characterised by marked proximal stiffness and pain but rarely weakness and the muscle enzymes are typically normal. Although hypothyroidism can present with a proximal myopathy and elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels the latter are rarely elevated above 500IU/l and dysphagia would not be typical. Guillain-Barre syndrome causes demyelination and axonal degeneration, which results in acute, ascending and progressive neuropathy. 75% of patients have a history of preceding infection, usually of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. Mild rises in CK can be seen but they are not as marked as in polymyositis, and the progression of disease is much quicker."

C5b recruits C6, C7, C8 and C9 to form membrane attack complex"
immune system,381,"A 79-year-old woman presents with mild dyspnoea and confusion. Of note in her past medical history is a one year history of Raynaud's phenomenon. On examination her pulse is 118 beats per minute, she has a blood pressure of 122/88 mmHg, and she has a small ulcer on her right big toe.

The most likely diagnosis here is Waldenström's macroglobulinaemia (WM). WM refers to a condition that presents in the seventh or eighth decade of life. It is characterised by the presence of a high level of a macroglobulin (immunoglobulin M [IgM]), elevated serum viscosity and the presence of a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate in the bone marrow, resulting in pancytopenias. Raynaud's phenomenon may herald the onset of this condition and is due to cryoglobulinaemia. The monoclonal IgM causes:  hyperviscosity syndrome cryoglobulinaemia types 1 and 2 coagulation abnormalities polyneuropathies cold agglutinin disease and anaemia primary amyloidosis, and tissue deposition of amorphous IgM in skin, the gastrointestinal tract, kidneys, and other organs.  The other conditions described here are not commonly associated with WM, and are more often seen in combination with myeloma. Erythema repens gyratum is a skin rash thought to be a paraneoplastic process."
immune system,382,"A 55-year-old woman with longstanding well controlled seropositive RA, treated with methorexate (20 mg/week) and folic acid 5 mg/day, presents with cough productive of green phlegm, fever (38.5°C), and severe sore throat. On examination, the BP is 110/70 mmHg, SaO2 is 98% on air, there is an occasional crackle at the right base. A chest x ray is normal. FBC, UEC, and LFTs are also normal. The CRP is 34 mg/L. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action?","IV antibiotics, continue methotrexate","IV antibiotics, stop methotrexate, and give folinic acid rescue","IV antibiotics, stop methotrexate temporarily","Oral antibiotics, continue methotrexate",Stop methotrexate,C,"The most likely diagnosis in this scenario is a lower respiratory tract infection. In the setting of acute infection, most DMARDs (except hydroxychloroquine) should be discontinued until the infectious process has resolved. Whilst it is possible the infection could be successfully treated with oral antibiotics, there is not an option here which includes this with stopping methotrexate therefore this is the correct answer. Methotrexate is a folic acid antagonist. It can result in a pneumonitis that manifests with non-specific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, cough and dyspnoea. It is rare and the presence of a productive cough here makes the diagnosis less likely but if suspected methotrexate should be stopped immediately. Additional adverse effects include hepatotoxicity, alopecia, mouth ulcers and nausea. Folic acid should be given daily to reduce the incidence of these in patients treated with methotrexate. Taken in overdose, methotrexate can cause multiple organ damage. Folinic acid is indicated and should be given intravenously as soon as it is suspected to limit toxicity. There is no suggestion of methotrexate overdose in this patient, and therefore folinic acid is not indicated."

He is currently partially weight bearing and reports particular difficulty ascending the stairs at home. His temperature is 37.2°C, pulse 88, blood pressure 128/90 mmHg. The left knee is swollen, tender and normothermic with crepitus present during a markedly reduced active range of motion. Initial investigations demonstrated the following;    FBC Normal   Westergren ESR 38 mm/hr (0-30)   CRP less than5 mg/L (less than10)   Rheumatoid factor titre 1:80 (greater than1:40)   Synovial fluid aspirate WCC 1800/mm^3 (less than2000)    Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Borrelia burgdorferi monoarticular synovitis,Calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy,Patellofemoral osteoarthritis,Prepatellar bursitis,Rheumatoid arthritis,C,"This 72-year-old man presents with a classical history for patellofemoral osteoarthritis (OA). The following fulfil the clinical criteria for diagnosis:  His age (greater than45 years) Morning stiffness lasting less than 30 minutes Functional limitation joint crepitus on active motion  Joint crepitus does not occur with prepatellar bursitis. His inflammatory markers are normal, militating against rheumatoid arthritis. The upper limit for synovial fluid WCC in OA is 2000/mm^1. White cells higher than this may suggest an inflammatory or septic arthritis, depending on the clinical context. His weakly positive rheumatoid factor (titre should be greater than1:40) is likely a product of his age. The minimum incubation period for Lyme disease is three days^2, and the diagnosis is much less likely in a patient of this age where osteoarthritis is highly prevalent There is no mention of crystals on synovial fluid examination to suggest pseudogout, although this can complicate osteoarthritis.

immune system,386,A 75-year-old man has persistent back pain for several months that is unrelated to physical activity. He has lost 12 kg in weight during this time.

Which of the following additional laboratory test findings is he most likely to have?,Blood culture positive for Neisseria gonorrhoeae,"Parathyroid hormone, intact, of 100 pg/mL (normal less than65)",Positive serology for Borrelia burgdorferi,Serum calcium of 1.4 mmol/L,Serum prostate specific antigen of 35 µgram/L,E,"The combination of back pain, weight loss and osteosclerotic lesions makes prostatic adenocarcinoma the most likely diagnosis in this case. Several malignancies, including those originating in the prostate, exhibit a propensity to metastasise to the bone. The sequelae include severe pain, pathological fractures, hypercalacaemia and spinal cord compression. Osteoclast-mediated bone degradation and subsequent bone loss are the hallmarks of secondary bone metastases from most solid tumours. In prostate carcinoma, the majority of lesions are osteosclerotic due to inappropriate bone production. The mainstay of treatment of metastatic bone disease is usually with intravenous bisphosphonates, which reduces bone pain in addition to treating hypercalcaemia. Current evidence indicates that the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, especially zolendronic acid, are potent inhibitors of bone resorption. Radiotherapy can also be used to reduce symptoms from localised bone lesions, and taxane-based chemotherapy can be effective for widespread disease. Increased understanding of the pathogenesis of bone metastases has resulted in the development of targeted therapies including RANKL inhibitors, and inhibitors of SRC and cABL kinases. Gonorrhoea, caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is the second most common sexually transmitted infection in the UK. It typically affects a younger age group than described here, and septicaemia is uncommon. Whilst it can be associated with septic and reactive arthritis, these CT findings are not typical. Hyperparathyroidism is a disease of increased bone resorption and bone formation. Radiographic findings differ in primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, but neither would explain the weight loss and the pain is typically more generalised. Borrelia burgdorferi causes Lyme disease, which classically presents with fever and erythema migrans following a tick bite in an edemic area (e.g. the New Forest). Without treatment, it can progress to disseminated disease with a polyarticular arthritis but isolated persistent back pain is not typical. Hypocalcaemia can be seen in patients with bone metastases, but this is rare and at levels this low you would expect symptoms of neuromuscular irritability (e.g. paraesthesia and carpopedal spasm).

She had been stung by a wasp and remembers a very severe reaction in which her whole forearm swelled up the last time she was stung by a wasp some three years earlier. Production of which of the following cytokines is most likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",IL-2,IL-4,IL-18,Interferon alpha,Interferon gamma,B,"This patient has an acute hypersensitivity reaction to a wasp sting. Th2 CD4 positive lymphocytes are involved in the pathogenesis of anaphylaxis, via the production of IL-4/IL-13 that act on B cells to increase IgE production and precipitate the development of acute hypersensitivity. IL-4 also exacerbates anaphylaxis by acting synergistically with other vasoactive mediators to increase vascular permeability. Th1 cells lead to increased production of:  Interferon gamma IL-2, and Tumour necrosis factor.  An increase in the Th1:Th2 ratio is associated with a reduction in the risk of allergic/hypersensitivity reactions."

Which autoantibody test would confirm the diagnosis?",Anti ds-DNA,Antihistone,Anti-Jo-1,Anti-RNP,Anti-SCl70,B,"This patient has developed drug-induced lupus as a result of minocycline therapy. This is a syndrome of positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) that appears during therapy with medications and biologic agents. It has less female predilection than systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rarely involves central nervous system (CNS) and kidneys. It is rarely associated with anti-ds-DNA and is commonly (almost 100%) associated with antibodies to antihistones. Therefore, antihistone is the correct answer. It usually resolves over several weeks after discontinuation of the offending medication. About 50 drugs have been listed. The important ones are penicillamine, procainamide, phenytoin, carbamazepine, isoniazid, minocycline, ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, hydralazine, propylthiouracil, hydrochlorthiazide, interferons and TNF inhibitors.

Over the last few months she has noticed firm to hard swelling on several distal and proximal interphalangeal joints which were painful at onset, but are relatively painless now. There is no early morning stiffness. On examination, there are hard (bony) swellings on several distal and proximal IPJs, and squaring of the thumbs. A full blood count, ESR, and CRP done by the GP have been normal. What is the diagnosis?",Osteoarthritis (OA),Psoriatic arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,RS3PE,Tophaceous gout,A,"This patient has osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common joint diseases, and its incidence is increasing with the age and weight of the population. It presents with pain, commonly affecting the knees, hips and small joints of the hand. There may be bony swellings at distal and proximal IPJs, termed Heberden's and Bouchard's nodes respectively. Pathogenesis involves the localised loss of cartilage, with remodelling of adjacent bone. The associated pain is exacerbated by exercise and relieved by rest, although in advanced disease rest and night pain can develop. There may also be joint stiffness, typically in the morning or after rest. Diagnosis is often late, and treatment is usually aimed at reducing pain and improving function rather than targeting the disease process. The lack of early morning stiffness and absence of synovitis (soft-boggy swelling) at small hand joints makes RA or psoriatic arthritis unlikely. RS3PE (remitting seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting oedema) presents with acute onset polyarthritis, mainly in older men, with acute onset pitting oedema of hands and/or feet. Patients are seronegative for rheumatoid factor, and have an excellent response to low dose steroids. Gout is unlikely, as there is no history of acute gout, and no gouty tophi are described. "

Vitamin D concentrations should therefore be measured. Serum alkaline phosphatase is typically high as it is released from bone reflecting osteoblastic activity. Serum PTH is also usually elevated and normalises gradually on response to treatment.  Hypercalcaemia would be expected in multiple myeloma, hyperparathyroidism and hyperthyroidism. A DEXA scan would assess the bone mineral density which allows osteoporosis to be diagnosed. Due to her age, this patient may have osteoporosis, but it is unlikely to be the cause of her pain. Classically, osteoporosis in the absence of fracture, does not cause pain. Many patients with osteoporosis have concomitant disorders such as osteomalacia and osteoarthritis which cause bone pain."

Select the single best answer.",Aspirin 300 mg by mouth,Methylprednisolone 500 mg IV,Prednisolone 40 mg by mouth,Prednisolone 60 mg by mouth,Nothing,B,"These symptoms and investigation findings are typical of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA affects large and medium sized arteries, with a predilection for the external carotid, ciliary and retinal arteries. Endovascular damage and cytokine-mediated inflammation causes local ischaemia. There is considerable overlap with polymyalgia rheumatica, and symptoms of both should be sought. 20% of patients develop loss of vision, which can be prevented with timely recognition and treatment. Visual loss typically occurs early in the course of disease and, once established, rarely improves. The classically described jaw claudication occurs in a minority of cases, but does indicate a high risk of ischaemic complications. The typical presentation of GCA is a temporal headache, with myalgia, malaise and fever. ESR and CRP are usually raised. As soon as the diagnosis is suspected, high dose corticosteroids should be given. Current BSR guidelines recommend:  Uncomplicated GCA (no jaw or tongue claudication, or visual symptoms)  prednisolone 40-60 mg daily   Complicated GCA:  Evolving visual loss or history of amaurosis fugax: IV methylprednisolone 500 mg-1 g daily for three days, followed by oral corticosteroids Established visual loss: at least 60 mg prednisolone daily    Bone protection and proton-pump inhibitors should be co-prescribed. It is important to note that the pathological findings of giant cell arteritis persist for one to two weeks following initiation of corticosteroid, and therefore treatment should not be delayed to obtain a biopsy. Aspirin 75 mg once daily is sometimes given as an adjunct but higher doses are not recommended. Symptoms usually resolve quickly, often with two or three days. Once they and laboratory abnormalities resolve, the dose of corticosteroid can be reduced and usually stopped within two years. The patient should be monitored for recurrence throughout the taper: ESR every 4 weeks for 2-3 months, then every 8-12 weeks until 12-18 m after cessation of therapy. Giant cell arteritis is a medical emergency and should be treated without delay. It is not acceptable to give no treatment. "

immune system,409,A 40-year-old man presents with acute monoarthritis of the right knee. Gout is confirmed following joint aspiration and examination of the fluid under polarised light microscopy. He underwent endoscopy three weeks earlier because of dyspepsia and this confirmed a duodenal ulcer. Which of the following would be the best initial treatment for him?,Allopurinol,Indomethacin alone,Indomethacin and lansoprazole,Indomethacin and misoprostol,Intra-articular corticosteroid injection,E,"The principles of treating an acute episode of gout are:  Commence anti-inflammatory medication immediately, and continue for two weeks - non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first line in conjunction with gastro-protective medication where indicated; colchicine is an alternative but is slower to work and can be associated with significant diarrhoea Rest the affected joints Allopurinol should not be started during an acute attack but in patients already established on allopurinol it should be continued If diuretics are being used to treat hypertension an alternative antihypertensive should be considered, but they should not be stopped in the presence of heart failure Corticosteroids are highly effective, and can be used where NSAIDs are not tolerated, or in refractory disease (intra-articular, oral, intramuscular, intravenous).  In this scenario, NSAIDs are contraindicated due to the presence of active gastrointestinal ulceration. Even with coadminsitration of a gastroprotective mediation (for example, lansoprazole or misoprostal) the risk of haemorrhage or perforation is too high to use NSAIDs in this case. Initiation of allopurinol can prolong an acute attack of gout due to shifts in uric acid levels. It is therefore recommended only one to two weeks after the resolution of symptoms, usually with colchicine cover. Intra-articular corticosteroids is therefore the most appropriate answer in this case. If available, colchicine would be a reasonable option but it can be associated with significant gastrointestinal toxicity. The systemic absorption from intra-articular corticosteroids is extremely low, and as you are bypassing the intestine they do not carry risk of peptic ulceration associated with oral corticosteroid use. Potential local side effects of corticosteroid injections include increased pain for the first couple of days, septic arthritis, subcutaneous atrophy (causing skin dimpling), skin depigmentation, accidental nerve injury and tendon rupture.

immune system,410,"A 42-year-old woman presents with a small joint polyarthritis and significant morning stiffness which has increased over the past few months. On examination she has a symmetrical small joint polyarthritis affecting the proximal interphalangeal joints, metatarsophalangeal joints, wrists, elbows and knees; otherwise the physical examination is unremarkable.    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 7.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 201 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 82 μmol/L (60-120)   Rheumatoid factor Negative   Anti-CCP antibody Positive    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Polymyalgia rheumatica,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis,Seronegative arthritis,SLE,C,"Anticyclic citrullinated protein (CCP) antibodies were identified as early as the 1970s in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is only recently that more specific assays have become available. They are the most specific biomarker associated with the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. It has been suggested that citrullination and the anticitrullinated peptide antibodies play a critical role in initiating the inflammatory response within rheumatoid arthritis. In patients with the clinical picture of rheumatoid arthritis who are rheumatoid factor negative, anti-CCP antibodies can aid in making the diagnosis between rheumatoid and other causes of arthritis. Positive rheumatoid factor is associated with a worse prognosis in rheumatoid arthritis. Polymyalgia rheumatica is associated with a markedly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and is characterised by severe bilateral pain and morning stiffness of the shoulder, neck and pelvic girdle. Reactive arthritis is the triad of arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivitis which is classically associated with sexually transmitted or gastrointestinal infection. Seronegative arthritis is a heterogenous group of inflammatory rheumatic disease with predominant involvement of axial and peripheral joints, and enthesis. There is a high incidence of HLA-B27, but rheumatoid factor is typically negative. Diseases belonging to this group include ankylosing spondylitis, reactive arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and Behçet's disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a heterogenous, multisystem, inflammatory autoimmune condition which is characterised by positive antinuclear antibodies. "
immune system,411,An otherwise healthy middle-aged man with no prior medical history has had increasing back pain and right hip pain for the past 10 years. The pain is worse at the end of the day. He has bony enlargement of the distal interphalangeal joints. A radiograph of the spine reveals the presence of prominent osteophytes involving the vertebral bodies. There is sclerosis with narrowing of the joint space at the right acetabulum seen on a radiograph of the pelvis. Which of the following pathologic processes is most likely to be taking place in this patient?,Gout,Lyme disease,Osteoarthritis,Osteomyelitis,Rheumatoid arthritis,C,"Degenerative osteoarthritis is a common and progressive condition that becomes more frequent and symptomatic with aging. There is erosion and loss of articular cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis typically involves small joints of the hands and feet most severely and there is a destructive pannus that leads to marked joint deformity. A gouty arthritis is more likely to be accompanied by swelling and deformity with joint destruction. The pain is not related to usage. Osteomyelitis represents an ongoing infection that produces marked bone deformity, not just joint narrowing. Lyme disease produces a chronic arthritis but it is typically preceded by a deer tick bite with a skin lesion. It is much less common than osteoarthritis."

Which of the following must be administered immediately?,IV chlorphenamine,IV corticosteroids,IV adrenaline,Nebulised salbutamol,IM adrenaline,E,"In Anaphylaxis IM adrenaline must be administered. It is quick to administer and IV should not be utilised except by very senior staff who have experience with it's use. Salbutamol nebulisers, Chlorphenamine and Corticosteroids may also be administered after the adrenaline."
immune system,413,A 45-year-old female presents with symptoms and signs suggestive of a pyelonephritis. A MSU reveals +++ WBCs and a heavy growth of an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Escherichia coli is isolated. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?,Amoxicillin,Ciprofloxacin,Co-amoxiclav,Imipenem,Trimethoprim,D,An ESBL is an enzyme that inactivates most beta-lactamase antibiotics. These organisms are often resistant to other antibiotics such as trimethoprim and ciprofloxacin. Beta-lactam/beta-lactam inhibitor combinations such as co-amoxiclav may have some activity but are unreliable when used to treat severe infections.
immune system,414,"A 55 year old gentleman with a history of hypertension, currently controlled with ramipril, presents with swelling of his tongue and lips.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylactic reaction,Angioedema secondary to ramipril,Hereditary angioedema,Trauma,C1 inhibitor deficiency,B,The most likely diagnosis due to the age of the patient is ACE inhibitor-associated angioedema.  Hereditary angioedema/C1 inhibitor deficiency would be unusual at this age although levels should be checked to confirm.  Anaphylactic reaction would be possible if there was other features or a history of known allergen taken.  Idiopathic angioedema can occur but there is a likely precipitant in this case.
immune system,415,A 75 year old female with known osteoarthritis presents with a painful thumb.  She is otherwise well and there is no history of trauma.  On examination there is swelling and tenderness in the first carpometacarpal joint.  She is apyrexial.  Blood tests are normal.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pseudogout,Osteoarthritis,Fracture,Rheumatoid arthritis,Gout,B,The most likely diagnosis is osteoarthritis due to the history and OA commonly affects the first carpometacarpal joint whilst RA more commonly affects the MCPs.  A fracture is unlikely due to it being atraumatic.  Pseudogout and gout are also less likely as they do not normally effect these joints.
immune system,416,"A 30-year-old housewife with SLE had some blood tests. Results of investigations are as follows:    Hb 121 g/L (115-165)   WBC 8.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 84% (40-75)   Platelet 90 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 14 mm/hr (0 - 20)   INR 1.1 (less than1.4)   aPTT 48 seconds (30 - 40s)    aPTT did not normalise after addition of normal plasma. Blood film shows thrombocytopenia, no schistocytes. Urea, electrolytes, and creatinine are normal. What is the most likely explanation for the abnormal aPTT?",Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS),Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,A,"This patient has antiphospholipid antibody syndrome which is a non-inflammatory pro-thrombotic state in vivo, in the presence of laboratory tests suggesting an anticoagulant state. The antiphospholipid antibodies (anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant) cause coagulation defect in-vitro (raised aPTT which fails to correct after the addition of normal human plasma). However, despite the coagulation defects and thrombocytopenia, the lupus anticoagulant causes arterial and venous thromboses in vivo. Disseminated intravascular clotting and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura are severe systemic illnesses, where bleeding may occur due to consumption of clotting factors, and platelets by an overactive clotting cascade. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura does not cause raised aPTT. HUS can be typical or atypical often after exposure to E. Coli 0157 leading to haemolytic anaemia and renal failure."

HBsAg and HBcAg are seen during acute infection. HbcAg suggested previous infection.  Anti-HBe suggests previous infection with low infectivity.
immune system,419,"A 60 year old male presents to his GP complaining of pain in his legs. He is also complaining of lower back pain and knee pain. On examination there is bowing of the tibia. He is otherwise fit and well. Bloods reveal an elevated ALP, normal calcium and phosphate level. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Rickets,Osteoporosis,Osteomalacia,Paget's Disease,Bony Metastases,D,"The history, clinical findings and blood results are indicative of Paget's disease. It can lead to joint pain if the bone involved is close to a joint as it can cause cartilage damage and osteoarthritis. Common deformities include bowing of the tibia, kyphosis and frontal bossing. Complications include nerve compression such as deafness, pathological fractures, high output cardiac failure and spinal stenosis. The disease is often asymptomatic and may only be found incidentally with typical xray findings of osteolytic and sclerotic lesions or the findings of an isolated elevated ALP. Calcium, phosphate, PTH and vitamin D levels are usually normal although there can be hypercalcaemia if there is immobility. Urinary excretion of deoxypyridinoline and N-telopeptide are elevated. In metastases there is normally an increase in calcium and other features of underlying malignancy and bowing is not usually a feature. In Osteomalacia you would not expect to find bowing of the tibia and hypocalcaemia and hypophosphataemia are normally observed."

Among infants with complete heart block due to neonatal lupus, anti-Ro/SSA and/or anti-La/SSB antibodies bind to fetal cardiac tissue, leading to autoimmune injury of the AV node and its surrounding tissues"
immune system,421,"According to NICE guidelines, which of the following has a role in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA)?",Acupuncture,Chondroitin sulphate,Glucosamine hydrochloride,Intra-articular hyaluronic acid,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation,E,"NICE guidelines recommend formulating individualised management plans for patients with osteoarthritis. Behavioural change, such as exercise, weight loss and suitable footwear should be encouraged. Comorbidities which compound the effect of osteoarthritis symptoms should be identified and their treatment optimised. Paracetamol and/or topical NSAIDs (for knee or hand OA) should be offered before considering oral NSAIDs. If symptoms are not controlled with the above strategies, oral NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors (but not etoricoxib) can be used. A proton pump inhibitor should be co-prescribed. The lowest effective dose should be prescribed for the shortest period possible. If the patient is already taking low-dose aspirin, an alternative analgesic should be considered. Treatments which are not recommended include rubefacients, intra-articular hyaluronan, electro-acupuncture and chondroitin or glucosamine products. Adjuvants which can be used include opioid analgesics, topical capsaicin and intra-articular corticosteroids. Application of heat or cold packs, or TENS, can be considered if other strategies are ineffective. Manipulation and stretching can be helpful, particularly for hip osteoarthritis. Bracing/joint supports can be used for patients with biomechanical joint pain or instability. Patients should be referred for joint surgery if they have already been offered all of the core treatments or if they have refractory joint symptoms which have a substantial impact on their quality of life. If there is a clear history of mechanical locking, referral for arthroscopic lavage and debridement should be considered. "

immune system,423,A 60 year old farmer presents with left hip pain.  He first noticed 6 months previously however it has gradually worsened since then.  It worsens over the day and is worst at the end of the day or after movement.  He does notice some stiffness in the morning.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Gout,Rheumatoid arthritis,Osteoarthritis,Pseudogout,Lyme disease,C,"This history is indicative of osteoarthritis.  This is not typical joint involvement in RA and the pain is often worse in the morning.  Similarly the clinical and x-ray findings are typical of osteoarthritis rather than RA, gout or pseudogout.  Lyme disease follows a tick bite and has a characteristic rash of erythema chronicum migrans.  Although there can be arthralgia, there is often other systemic involvement and there is no evidence in the history of this."

This patient has developed bowel sepsis (foul smelling diarrhoea, hypothermic, tachycardic, hypotensive) secondary to pancytopenia induced by the co-administration of allopurinol and azathioprine. The prodrug azathioprine is metabolised to its active compound 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP). 6-MP undergoes catabolic oxidation to 6-thiouric acid by xanthine oxidase. Allopurinol has a peak onset of action of one to two weeks and works by inhibiting xanthine oxidase. Co-administration of these drugs may lead to accumulation of 6-MP and increases the risk of myelosuppression. The newer xanthine oxidase inhibitor, febuxostat, can also result in the same problem and is also contraindicated. A Crohn's flare would not typically cause pancytopenia. Normal amylase refutes pancreatitis. "

immune system,430,A 16-year-old female develops an urticarial reaction and is suspected of peanut allergy yet measurement of peanut-specific IgE antibodies on RAST testing is within the normal range. Which of the following would be the next most appropriate investigation?,C1 esterase inihbitor concentrations,Food provocation testing,Mast cell degranulation testing,No other test necessary diagnosis can be secured on history,Skin prick testing,E,"Skin prick testing remains the first line for detection of allergen-specific IgE. It involves inserting a small amount of allergen under the skin, and observing the result after a set time. It can induce anaphylaxis, and must therefore be done in an environment where resuscitation facilities are available. RAST testing detects the presence of allergen-specific IgE in the peripheral blood. There are a number of reasons for a false negative RAST test, including:  immediately following anaphylaxis / allergic reaction (transient drop in IgE) waning of allergen-specific IgE with time following a reaction, and unstable allergens in the RAST substrates (especially food allergens).  Mast cell tryptase can be measured, but is only secreted during true anaphylaxis. Levels peak at 1-2 hours, and return to baseline by 6 hours. It therefore must be taken during an episode of severe allergy and would not be helpful in this case. Food provocation testing can result in severe reactions, and therefore are reserved for cases where the other tests are not indicative of allergy, or where children are felt to have grown out of allergy. C1 esterase inhibitor levels can be measured where a patient is suspected of having deficiency. However, these patients present with angioedema rather than urticaria. Diagnosis of allergy has a significant impact on a patient's life, and diagnosis should not be made on history alone."

He states the pain is worse on movement and he has been building DIY furniture but now finds it difficult to use a screwdriver or even hold a cup of coffee, due to the pain. On examination pain is worsened on resisted wrist extension. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lateral Epicondylitis,Medial Epicondylitis,De Quervain's tendonitis,Cervical radiculopathy,Ulnar nerve palsy,A,"This patient is most likely suffering from lateral epicondylitis. It is an overuse syndrome due to wrist extension and is also known as tennis elbow. It typically leads to pain on the lateral side of the elbow which can radiate down the posterior aspect of the forearm. On examination there is tenderness over the lateral epicondyle and resisted wrist and middle finger extension worsen the pain. The pain can be so severe that patients find it difficult even to hold a cup. In medial epicondylitis, the pain is over the medial aspect of the elbow and pain is worse on resisted wrist flexion. Cervical radiculopathy would not lead to the findings here. De quervain's tendonitis leads to wrist pain."

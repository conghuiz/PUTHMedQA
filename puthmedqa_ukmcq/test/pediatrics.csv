pediatrics,1,A 6-week-old male infant presents with projectile vomiting following feeds. He has been perfectly well until now. Examination reveals that he is constipated and dehydrated. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Duodenal atresia,Diaphragmatic hernia,Hirschsprung's disease,Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,Staphylococcus food poisoning,D,The history of projectile vomiting suggests pyloric stenosis. This is due to thickening of the muscle at the pylorus and is treated by pyloroplasty. The incidence is approximately 1 in 4000 live births and is commoner in males than females.
pediatrics,2,A 4-month-old child is diagnosed with napkin rash. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment of mild napkin rash?,Bactroban cream,Exposure to air,Oral flucloxacillin,Topical betamethasone,Topical iodine,B,"Causes of napkin rash (or diaper rash) include contact dermatitis, due to ammonia from urine, which may burn the skin. Infection with bacteria and Candida yeasts may cause nappy rash, as can psoriasis and atopic dermatitis affecting the nappy area. Infection is often superimposed. Nappy rash is not an indicator of infantile eczema , but is often worse in those who have it, and it is not more common in boys, nor is it less common in soy fed infants. Treatment is best achieved by prevention with frequent (disposable absorbent) nappy changing, and fluid feeding early in the day to lessen night time urination. Anti-fungal lotions may also be useful."
pediatrics,3,A multiple drug resistant Escherichia coli was isolated from the urine of a patient with severe sepsis. What is the likely mechanism of resistance?,Alteration of drug target,Drug efflux,Drug impermeability,Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production,Penicillinase production,D,Some E. coli isolates produce an ESBL that inactivates second and third generation cephalosporins. The class of drugs that will most reliably treat these infections are the carbapenems.
pediatrics,4,You are a GP who has noted an increase in accidents in children attending your practice and want to find out where children are most at risk. What is the most common cause of accidental death in children?,Drowning,Falls,Fire and flames,Poisoning,Road traffic accidents,E,"After infancy, accidental injury is the main cause of death in children in the United Kingdom. Socioeconomic inequalities in accidental death and injury remain very marked, despite the absolute rates of death from injury falling over the last few decades. For example, the children of parents who have never worked are 13 times more likely to die from unintentional injury and 37 times more likely to die from exposure to smoke, fire or flames. Injury is also the most common cause of physical disability in young adults. Boys are more likely to have accidents than girls. Road traffic accidents are the leading cause of fatalities in children - road traffic accidents account for nearly half of all accidental injury fatalities in children altogether;  1 in 20 deaths in under 5's 1 in 9 between 5 and 14 years, and nearly 1 in 3 in the later teens.  Whilst transport-related deaths account for a larger proportion of deaths, the morbidity from other forms of injury is greater. "
pediatrics,5,A 17-year-old girl presents with vomiting and her investigations show:    Sodium 120 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 3.0 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 2.2 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Urine sodium 2 mmol/L -   Urine osmolality 700 mosmol/kg (350-1000)    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Addison's disease,Bulimia nervosa,Diuretic abuse,Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion,Water intoxication,B,"This patient is likely to have bulimia - young girl with a likely low body mass contributing to the low urea, vomiting contributing to the hypokalaemia/hyponatraemia. Her urine sodium is appropriately low and due to a relative dehydration she has appropriately concentrated urine. This is not Addison's disease as urine sodium would be high with high urea and likely high potassium. Similarly it is not SIADH due to the low urine sodium. Diuretic abuse would cause high urine sodium. Water intoxication would produce a dilute urine."
pediatrics,6,"A 14-year-old girl is referred with an abdominal mass. This has been progressing in size over the past few weeks, and initially was associated with morning vomiting. She is otherwise healthy and reached menarche at 13 years. On examination she is at Tanner stage 5 for breast and pubic hair development. She has an abdominal mass arising from the pelvis reaching almost to the umbilicus, which is dull to percussion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Constipation/encopresis,Inborn errors of metabolism,"Malignancy e.g. neuroblastoma, Wilm's, lymphoma",Pregnancy,Renal anomalies,D,"She is pregnant. This can be confirmed by the appropriate exposure history, absence of periods, positive pregnancy test and antenatal ultrasound."
pediatrics,7,"A 3-year-old girl is brought in by ambulance from a house fire. She has extensive areas of peeling skin over the trunk and face, with blackening around the mouth and nostrils. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.7°C, respiratory rate 25/min, pulse 130/min. Capillary refill time of three seconds. 40% of second and third degree burns over the trunk and face. What is the most important part of management?",Analgesia,Bag and mask ventilation,Face mask oxygen,Intubation,IV fluid bolus,D,"The picture is one of severe burns and smoke inhalation. Shock can occur in the first few hours from loss of large amounts of plasma from denuded skin. The airway should be secured by immediate intubation before it becomes too oedematous and occludes completely. One hundred percent O2 should be given, as pulmonary oedema can be anticipated. Two large-bore cannulae should be inserted and 20 ml/kg of N. saline given. Maintenance and continuing losses should be calculated from the time of the fire. Analgesia is essential. "
pediatrics,8,Which of the following is a feature of babies born to mothers with diabetes mellitus?,Anaemia,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperglycaemia,Hyperthyroidism,Shoulder dystocia,E,Features of infants of diabetic mothers include:  Hypoglycaemia (as the fetus has been exposed to high circulating glucose levels resulting in the insulin hypersecretion and hence macrosomia) Congenital abnormalities  Talipes Congenital heart defects Polycythaemia Hypocalcaemia   Birth injuries/shoulder dystocia.
pediatrics,9,"A 16-year-old boy presents with a swollen, painful left knee and has more recently been aware of a non-blanching rash over the lower limbs. Investigations reveal:    Urine dipstick analysis Blood+++   Protein+   Serum creatinine 210 µmol/L (60-110)   Urine culture Negative -    He undergoes a renal biopsy. Which pathological abnormality is most likely to be present in this patient?",Basement membrane thickening,Focal and segmental sclerosis,Linear deposition of IgG on the basement membrane,Mesangial deposition of IgA,Podocyte fusion,D,"Henoch-Schönlein purpura is an IgA mediated leucocytoclastic vasculitis that is characterised by a purpuric rash, arthralgia and glomerulonephritis. Bowel involvement is also a feature. An IgA nephropathy is typical of HSP but mesangioproliferative Gn is also a feature. The histology reveals mesangial deposition of IgA predominantly, but IgG, IgM, C3, and properdin deposition also may occur. These deposits also can occur in the subendothelial and subepithelial glomerular spaces."
pediatrics,10,"A 12-year-old girl presents with left ear pain and fever, worsening over the past three days. Today her mother has noted a whitish creamy discharge from the ear canal. She was born at 38/40 gestation weighing 3.8 kg and there were no neonatal problems. She is fully immunised. She trains regularly in a swimming team. On examination she has a temperature of 38.2°C and has a red left tragus. This is exquisitely tender, and examination of the drum is impossible because of the pain and creamy thin discharge. She has shotty tender posterior cervical glands. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Group A streptococcal pharyngitis,Mastoiditis,Otitis externa,"Otitis media, acute","Otitis media, recurrent",C,The history suggests an acute otitis externa. The tight adherence of skin to the underlying perichondrium and periosteum make the pain worse than the degree of inflammation would suggest. An ear swab culture should be sent and neomycin and colistin/polymyxin ear drops commenced. This covers the common Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria usually responsible. 
pediatrics,11,"A 10-month-old male baby with haemophilia is brought to the Emergency department by his parents with a 36 hour history of intermittent episodes of inconsolable crying and vomiting. The parents say the baby's stools are mixed with blood. On examination, a sausage-shaped mass is palpable over the right side of abdomen. Per rectal examination reveals an empty rectum but blood is noticed on the glove of the examining finger. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,Intestinal atresia,Intussusception,Meckel’s diverticulum,Meconium ileus,C,"Intussusception is caused due to invagination of a segment of bowel into its adjoining lower segment. Mesentery and vessels may also become involved with the intraluminal loop and squeezed within the engulfing segment. Although the precise aetiology is not clear intussusception is known to occur with greater frequency in children who have undergone recent abdominal surgery, either intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal operations. It may be due to early adhesions or focal oedema of the bowel wall, creating a lead point for the intussusception. Intussusception is more common in boys and usually occurs under the age of 1. Intussusception is associated with:  Haemophilia Henoch-Schönlein purpura Haemangiomas, and Gastrointestinal lymphomas.  Clinical features of this condition include severe colicky abdominal pain (causing intermittent inconsolable cries with the child drawing up the legs) and vomiting. Between attacks, the infant may appear in good health. The infant may pass redcurrant jelly stools and a sausage shaped mass is palpable on abdominal examination. Rectal examination may reveal blood. The treatment plan, in the absence of signs of peritonism, should be to reduce the intussusception by using either a barium or air enema. Ten per cent recur within 24 hours and so all patients should be admitted and observed. If this fails or if there are signs of peritonism then surgery is indicated."
pediatrics,12,"A 3-year 5-month-old child presents with a three day history of coryza, followed by cough and wheeze. He has had four similar episodes in the past, and has flexural eczema. There is a family history of hay fever. On examination his saturations are 92% in air, with a respiratory rate of 55/min and moderate recession. The heart rate is 150/min. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Atopy-associated asthma,Non-atopic wheezing,Gastroesophageal reflux,Transient early wheezing,B,"This child has cough and wheeze triggered by upper respiratory infection on an atopic background. Since these have begun in early pre-school years, happened on several occasions on a background of atopy, he can now be labelled atopy-associated asthmatic. These children are at highest risk for persistence of symptoms into later childhood and adulthood. It is associated with eczema, allergic rhinitis and food allergy. Transient early wheezing is very common in toddlers, with recurrent episodes of cough and wheeze usually triggered by respiratory viruses. This tends to resolve before the age of 5, with low risk for asthma in later life. Non-atopic wheezing begins in early life, often triggered by RSV. There is bronchial hyper-responsiveness in infancy, which tends to resolve with low risk for persistent asthma. "
pediatrics,13,Which of the following is a particular risk factor for child abuse?,Caucasian parents,Disability,Middle class background,Nursery aged child,Several adults living in same house,B,"Studies have shown that the aetiology of child abuse is multi-factorial. Disabled children are particularly vulnerable to child abuse. They have a high level of dependency on their carers and limited mobility to escape an abusive environment. Such children often have communication difficulties and may be unable to disclose any abuse to which they might be subjected. The high level of care these children require often causes stress within a family and they may have low bone density that contributes to an increased risk of fracture. Other risk factors include:  Mental illness in family Dysfunctional family relationships Deprived background Young age of child (less than1 year greatest risk) Alcohol/drug misuse Social isolation Parental depression/stress, and Exposure to maltreatment when potential abuser was a child.  "
pediatrics,14,Which of the following is the most appropriate action following aspiration of a foreign body?,Batteries should be removed immediately using a magnet,Bronchoscopy should be carried out as soon as a positive history of aspiration is obtained,Most aspirated food objects can be left to pass naturally,The object should be removed using a flexible bronchoscope,The object should be removed using a rigid bronchoscope,E,"Foreign body aspiration usually occurs in older infants and toddlers; children less than 3-years-old account for 73% of cases. It is also important to ask siblings in case they have caused the aspiration! Coughing or choking episodes accompanied by wheezing is highly suggestive of an aspirated foreign body. The most serious complication is complete obstruction of the airway. Globular food objects are especially dangerous. Three stages of symptoms occur from aspiration of object into the airway:  Initial event - paroxysms of coughing, choking and possible immediate airway obstruction occur immediately Asymptomatic interval - foreign body becomes lodged, immediate irritating symptoms subside. Complications - erosion, obstruction or infection develops. Complications include fever, cough, haemoptysis, pneumonia and atelectasis  Batteries are rarely aspirated, but usually swallowed into the oesophagus and could not be safely removed using a magnet. One-third of aspirated objects are nuts, especially peanuts. Other food fragments are also common. Bronchoscopy should be carried out promptly if foreign body aspiration is suspected, but preoperative studies must be obtained, the patient needs to be adequately hydrated and the stomach emptied to minimise further complications during the bronchoscopy. Aspirated food objects should be removed promptly to prevent late complications. A rigid bronchoscope should be used rather than a flexible scope. "
pediatrics,15,A 6-year-old attends clinic with the results of hearing tests. She has been followed up over the last four months because of otitis media with effusion (OME). Her hearing tests show reduced hearing levels of 30 dbHL the same as when she first attended. What is the recommended treatment for a child with persistent hearing loss with OME?,Insertion of ventilation tubes,Provision of hearing aids,Treatment with an extended course of antibiotics,Treatment with systemic decongestant and antihistamines,Systemic steroids,A,"Children with persistent bilateral OME documented over a period of three months with a hearing level in the better ear of 25-30 dBHL or worse averaged at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz (or equivalent dBA where dBHL not available) should be considered for surgical intervention with ventilation tubes. Exceptionally, healthcare professionals should consider surgical intervention in children with persistent bilateral OME with a hearing loss less than 25-30 dBHL where the impact of the hearing loss on a child's developmental, social or educational status is judged to be significant. "
pediatrics,16,"An 18-month-old boy is presented because of maternal concerns about delayed speech. He was born at 39+4/40 weighing 2.6 kg and there were no neonatal problems. He sat at 12 months of age, and now pulls to stand. He is able to make a tower of 2 inch-high bricks. He is saying two to three single words which his mother can understand and seems to hear well. He drinks from a bottle. He is fully immunised, on no medications, and there is no family or social history of note. On examination he looks well. He is on the 25th centile for height and weight and OFC. There are no specific findings of note. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Autism,Chronic secretory otitis media,Global developmental delay,Pervasive developmental disorder,"Speech delay, isolated",C,"The history suggests moderate global developmental delay. He is functioning at about the 12 month level in gross motor, fine motor and vision, hearing and speech, and social development. The history gives no indication of an underlying cause for the delay. A detailed developmental assessment should be performed plus investigations for an underlying cause. At minimum these should include thyroid function tests (TFTs) and karyotype to rule out Fragile X syndrome. Other investigations may be indicated if a specific disorder is suspected."
pediatrics,17,A child was brought in to emergency department by his parents for taking his grand- dad’s medicines. There is an extra systole in the ECG. Which drug was taken?,Digoxin,Amitryptiline,Atenolol,Ramipril,Bendroflumethiazide,A,Both digoxin and amitryptiline can cause extrasystole
pediatrics,18,A 9-year-old boy is rushed into the Emergency department after multiple syncopal episodes. He had been experiencing headaches in the past week. A diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning was made after his father raised concerns about their central heating system. Which of the following is the most useful treatment?,Carbon dioxide therapy,Desferrioxamine,Hyperbaric oxygen therapy,Hypobaric oxygen therapy,Methaemoglobin,C,"Carbon monoxide binds to haemoglobin and displaces oxygen. It has an affinity 250 times that of oxygen. Carbon monoxide impairs the ability of haemoglobin to release oxygen to the tissues. It also binds to cytochrome oxidase in tissues and impedes oxygen utilisation. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning depend on the concentration of carboxyhaemoglobin in the blood. Initial symptoms are non-specific and include headache, malaise, and nausea. Headaches then become more severe and dizziness, visual changes and weakness may occur. Syncope can be the first symptom. At high concentrations, coma, seizures, respiratory instability and death may occur. Treatment is supportive and includes the administration of high concentrations of oxygen. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is the use of oxygen at a level higher than atmospheric pressure. It increases the partial pressure of oxygen in the body tissues. Under normal atmospheric pressure, oxygen transport is limited by the oxygen binding capacity of haemoglobin. Desferrioxamine is used as a chelating agent to remove excess iron from the body. Carbon dioxide therapy would not increase the partial pressure of oxygen so would have no therapeutic benefit. Methaemoglobin administration would not be useful as it cannot carry oxygen. "
pediatrics,19,Which one of the following statements correctly applies to whooping cough infection?,Erythromycin invariably shortens the paroxysmal stage of the disease,Infants are usually immune within the first two to three months of life,Intracranial haemorrhage is a possible complication,Tetracycline is the antibiotic of choice,Vaccination against whooping cough is contraindicated in infants whose apgar score at birth is below five.,C,Any infant who has not received the full course of immunisation against pertussis is likely to develop the infection if exposed. Pertussis immunisation is contraindicated if there was an allergic reaction or seizures/encephalopathy following the first vaccine. Erythromycin is the recommended treatment for at least 14 days; it may eliminate the organism from nasal secretions but there is no evidence that it shortens the paroxysmal stage of the illness. Intracranial haemorrhage may rarely occur and subconjunctival haemorrhage is common.
pediatrics,20,A child presents because of concerns that he began walking late. Which of the following would lead you to suspect a diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy?,A history of recurrent falls,Abnormal nerve conduction studies,Calf muscle wasting,Poor feeding since birth,Urinary incontinence,A,"This form of muscular dystrophy usually manifests in toddlers and early childhood when motor skills are developed such as running and jumping. Pseudohypertrophy of the calf muscles is characteristic. The first symptoms may be delayed walking and frequent falls. Poor feeding is not a feature. Urinary incontinence is associated with spinal cord and upper motor neurone lesions and not with muscular dystrophy. Motor and sensory nerve conduction velocities are normal, but electromyogram (EMG) shows myopathic changes."
pediatrics,21,Which of the following conditions is detected on the newborn bloodspot screening test?,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Congenital adrenal hypoplasia,Congenital primary hypothyroidism,Secondary hypothyroidism,Tertiary hypothyroidism,C,"The newborn bloodspot screening test screens for primary hypothyroidism - raised thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Other conditions screened for in the newborn screening test are  Phenylketonuria Cystic fibrosis Sickle cell anaemia Medium chain acyl dehydrogenase enzyme deficiency (MCCAD).  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is not screened as part of newborn screening, unlike in some other countries. "
pediatrics,22,A 10-year-old child is referred to the community adolescent and mental health team as her mother has noticed that she has certain rituals.  Each time she leaves a room she has to turn the light off and on three times and she gets upset if furniture in the living room is moved to a different position. Her teacher has also commented that she becomes very distressed if there is the slightest dirty mark or error in her writing book so much so she often rips the page out and begins her work again even when it was nearly completed. She used to be very good at school but recently her performance has deteriorated. Select the most appropriate treatment option for this child?,Cognitive behavioural therapy,Cognitive behavioural therapy and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,Parental reassurance that she will grow out of the problem,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,Tricyclic antidepressants,B,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is considered to be a neuropsychiatric disorder which presents with common obsessions and compulsions. These often present in the form of rituals such as repeated hand washing, checking of objects and repeated movements. Recently OCD has been shown to occur in up to two to three out of 100 children and adolescents at any one time. The treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder takes the form of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly fluoxetine, in combination with cognitive behavioural therapy. This form of combination treatment has been shown to have good effects. Whilst some studies have suggested there is an increased risk of suicide in adolescents treated with SSRIs further larger studies have not found this to be the case. It is generally felt that the benefits outweigh the risks in obsessive compulsive disorder. Clomipramine (a tricyclic antidepressant) may also be used however the side effect profile is considered to be worse than SSRIs. The prognosis of anxiety disorders as a whole is quite good and children with anxiety disorders often do not continue to have anxiety disorders as adults, the exception to this rule is obsessive compulsive disorder, which carries a particularly poor prognosis in its severest form."
pediatrics,23,A 2-year-old girl was brought into the Emergency department with a temperature of 38.9°C. She had stridor at rest and looked distressed and toxic. Her mother said that she had become unwell overnight. Which of the following should be next in the management of the patient?,Arrange prompt anaesthetic and senior review,Insert cannula and start IV antibiotics,Intubate immediately,Lie patient flat to check for organomegaly associated with vascular rings,Request a lateral neck x ray in the radiology department,A,"Further assessment, early anaesthetic and senior involvement would be appropriate in this case. Inserting a cannula and starting IV antibiotics is incorrect as it could further upset the child, although antibiotics may prove to be necessary. There is no suggestion from the question that the airway is at risk - more information is needed. Intubation has its own risks and should not be undertaken unless absolutely necessary. The safest option would be to call the anaesthetic team early so that they are aware of the patient and prepared to come quickly if required. Always call for senior help with a patient like this. Lying the child flat could upset them as they will feel more vulnerable and compromise their airway. There is no association with organomegaly and vascular rings. Do not x ray. Although appearances may be diagnostic, it wastes time and could be dangerous."
pediatrics,24,A 6-year-old is admitted unconscious. His breath smells of acetone. Blood gas estimation is as follows:    pH 7.05 (7.36-7.44)   pCO2 24 mmHg (35-45)   Standard bicarbonate 12 mmol/L (20-28)   Blood glucose 47 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)    Which one of the following statements is correct?,He has a metabolic acidosis,He has a respiratory acidosis,He should be treated with 5% dextrose.,He should be treated with subcutaneous insulin,Urea is likely to be low,A,"As a result of osmotic diuresis and natriuresis mediated by glucose he will be dehydrated. This will raise blood urea. pCO2 and serum bicarbonate are low and this is consistent with metabolic acidosis and respiratory compensation. In respiratory acidosis the pCO2 would be high and bicarbonate levels would be higher to effect a 'metabolic compensation'. In view of the fact that he has diabetic ketoacidosis, treatment with insulin should be commenced. Volume replacement with 0.9% saline must be adequate, however over-vigorous rehydration could precipitate cerebral oedema."
pediatrics,25,Which of the following is the correct advice to a mother who is concerned because she cannot retract the prepuce of her two year old son?,Circumcision is indicated,He is likely to get recurrent balanitis,Regular retraction of the prepuce during bathing,This is a completely normal condition at this age,Urethral valves are well known association and further investigations are required,D,This question relates to the natural history of the foreskin. The foreskin is still developing at birth and hence is often non-retractable up to the age of 3 years. The process of separation is spontaneous and does not require manipulation. By the age of 3 years 90% of boys will have a retractable foreskin. In a small proportion of boys this natural process of separation continues well into childhood. 
pediatrics,26,A 2-year-old child has an uncomplicated coarctation of the aorta. The constriction is located distal to the left subclavian artery. Which of the following would be decreased in this patient?,Blood flow in the lower body,Blood flow in the upper body,Blood pressure in the upper limbs,Vascular resistance in the lower limbs,Vascular resistance in the upper limbs,D,"This patient with a fully compensated coarctation blood flow is normal in both the lower and upper limbs despite increased pressure in the upper limbs compared to lower body. Thus as resistance = pressure/blood flow, resistance must be lower in the lower limbs."
pediatrics,27,Medical indications for circumcision in children include which of the following?,Ambiguous genitalia,Cryptorchidism,Hypospadias,Non-retractile foreskin in a 5-year-old child,Recurrent balanitis,E,Circumcision is contraindicated in hypospadiasis since the tissue of the foreskin may be required for urethral reconstruction. Circumcision should be considered in the setting of recurrent urinary tract infections and particularly balanitis. The foreskin would not necessarily be retractable at aged 5.
pediatrics,28,Which is true regarding iron deficiency anaemia?,Cow's milk is a major source of iron for children,It commonly co-exists with thalassaemia,It does not affect school progress,Lead poisoning is commonly associated with iron deficiency,The commonest cause in adolescents is chronic blood loss,D,"Iron is absorbed in the proximal small intestine, mediated partly by the duodenal protein mobilferrin. About 10% of dietary iron is absorbed, and iron is absorbed two to three times more efficiently from human milk than from modified cow's milk. During the first years of life, because relatively small quantities of iron-rich foods are taken, it is often difficult to attain sufficient iron. The diet should include foods such as infant cereals or formulae that have been fortified with iron. Breast fed infants should receive iron supplements from 4 months of age. At best, the infant is in a precarious situation with respect to iron. Should the diet become inadequate, or external blood loss occur, anaemia ensues rapidly. In children with microcytic anaemia who fail to respond to iron, thalassaemia should be considered. In this country there is an increased incidence in those from the Mediterranean and those from the Indian sub-continent. Because many such children are socio-economically disadvantaged, there may be an associated iron deficiency anaemia. Lead poisoning in this country is usually associated with eating lead paint. Since pica is associated with iron deficiency, the two often co-exist. "
pediatrics,29,A 1-year-old child presents with unexplained drowsiness. Which of the following investigations will be most helpful in making a specific diagnosis?,Chest x ray,ECG,Serum CK,Ultrasound scan of head,Urine toxicology,E,"Unexplained drowsiness should raise the suspicion of poisoning. The likely agents are hypnotics, tranquillisers or alcohol. Drug metabolites may be found in the blood or urine. Occasionally, the poisoning may be deliberate. An ultrasound scan of the head is only useful if the anterior fontanelle is open. Muscular disorders with raised CK usually present with hypotonia rather than drowsiness. Arrhythmias usually present with tachycardia or heart failure. "
pediatrics,30,"An 18-month-old girl presents with her mother to the emergency department with a viral illness. From examination findings you also note that her clothes are dirty, she has an offensive odour, her nappy is tattered and does not appear have been changed following soiling and she has dental caries in the few teeth she has. You suspect the child is being neglected. What should you do next?",Admit the child,Call the police,Confront the mother,Discuss with your senior colleagues,Inform social services,D,"This child has examination findings that would fit with being neglected. However, prior to any of the options listed above it would be better to take a full social history and a full examination by exposing and removing all the baby's clothes. If this is not possible, before informing other professionals such as the police or social services, it is key to discuss your concerns with a senior such as the registrar or the consultant. It may be that the child is admitted to the ward, but before doing so you should always share any child protection concerns with someone more senior. "
pediatrics,31,"The parents of a 7-year-old child are concerned that he has started bed wetting, because for the last three years he has been dry at night. What is the most appropriate action for this child?",Investigate for secondary causes,Prescribe DDAVP,Reassure that bedwetting would be expected at this age,Suggest a pre-bed routine and avoid drinks before going to bed,Suggest a star chart for this child,A,"Bed wetting would not be expected if the child has been dry for a considerable length of time, and so requires the exclusion of other causes such as:  Psychological effects (commonest) Urine tract infections, and Diabetes."
pediatrics,32,"Pulmonary function tests are not always helpful in infants and young children as they can be difficult to carry out.  However, they do have a role to play in cystic fibrosis and Guillan-Barre syndrome. Please select the correct definition:",Expiratory reserve volume - the forced expiratory volume in one second,Forced expiratory volume 1 - the amount of air left in the lungs after tidal expiration,Forced vital capacity - the amount of air that is moved in and out of the lungs with maximum inspiration and expiration,Functional residual capacity - the amount of air moved in and out of the lungs during each breath,Tidal volume - the amount of air exhaled by maximum expiratory effort after tidal expansion,C,It is important to understand the definitions before embarking on pulmonary function tests. Expiratory reserve volume is the amount of air exhaled by maximum expiratory effort after tidal expansion. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second is exactly that. Functional residual capacity is the amount of air left in the lungs after tidal expiration. Tidal volume is the amount of air moved in and out of the lungs during each breath. 
pediatrics,33,A 2-year-old girl presents with a 48 hour history of profuse diarrhoea which has become bloody this morning. Her parents are concerned as there is an outbreak of E. coli 0157 at her nursery. She has a haemolytic anaemia and acute renal failure. Which of the following is the best initial treatment for E. coli haemolytic uraemic syndrome?,3 day course of co-amoxiclav to treat the Escherichia coli gastroenteritis,7 day course of co-amoxiclav to treat the Escherichia coli gastroenteritis,Initial fluid bolus of 40 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride with 20 mml potassium chloride followed by electrolyte checks to protect kidneys,Loperamide or other antimotility agent until diarrhoea subsides and encourage fluid intake,"Supportive treatment, avoiding antibiotics and antimotility agents",E,"Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is the commonest cause of acute renal failure in children, particularly those less than 2 years of age. Diarrhoea associated HUS is the commonest type, usually as a result of Escherichia coli 0157. Toxin is released in gut and absorbed, causing endothelial damage, especially in renal microvasculature, leading to microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with thrombocytopenia and red blood cell fragmentation. Treatment is supportive, avoid antibiotics and antimotility agents; as motility slows, the gut is exposed to the toxins for a longer period of time and antibiotic induced injury to the bacterial membrane favours the acute release of large amounts of toxins. Fluid resuscitation is important due to the diarrhoeal illness, but fluid overload must be avoided and hyperkalaemia avoided and treated. If required, haemodialysis should be used. Plasma exchange may be required for severe cases. Antibiotics and antimotility agents should be avoided. If motility slows, the gut is exposed to the toxins for a longer period of time and antibiotic induced injury to the bacterial membrane favours the acute release of large amounts of toxins. Avoid antibiotics and antimotility agents in the treatment of Escherichia coli 0157 haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Initial fluid bolus of 40 ml/kg of 0.9% sodium chloride with 20 mml potassium chloride followed by electrolyte checks to protect kidneys would almost inevitably lead to fluid overload and hyperkalaemia. A fluid bolus is usually calculated using either 10 ml/kg or 20 ml/kg of crystalloid, and potassium should never be added to a bolus."
pediatrics,34,"A 6-year-old girl presents with cervical lymphadenopathy of three months standing, which has increased progressively in size. She has been off colour with a chronic cough and hoarse voice. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.8°C, respiratory rate 20/min and pulse 85/min. She looks unwell and thin and is in the third centile for weight, 25% for height. Massive rubbery enlargement of right cervical glands, which are non-tender. No overlying erythema. Otherwise well. What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV,Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Lymphoma,Mycobacterial adenitis,D,"The progressive enlargement of nodes over several months without associated inflammation suggests malignant infiltration. The abnormal voice suggests involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. Assessment will require chest x ray and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) of neck and thorax, and lymph node biopsy. Prognosis will depend on staging and histology (including molecular tests)."
pediatrics,35,There are a number of prognostic indicators in neuroblastoma.  Which one of the following confers a favourable prognosis?,1p loss,17q gain,Age greater than 1 year,Age less than1 year,MYCN amplification,D,"Infant (less than 1 year) neuroblastoma, if detected at a low stage, has a 90% survival, whereas disseminated disease is only cured in 20-30% despite intensive treatment. Decisions regarding the prognosis of neuroblastoma can be influenced by a number of factors.  Poor prognostic features include:  Age greater than 1 year 17p gain or 1q loss MYCN amplification Stage III or IV disease Raised LDH Unfavourable histology."
pediatrics,36,Which one of the following statements concerning pertussis infection is true?,A lymphocytic leucocytosis should be demonstrated to confirm the diagnosis,Absence of a whoop rules out the diagnosis in a child with a cough,Ampicillin is the drug of choice to eradicate the infection,Bronchiolitis obliterans is a recognised later complication,It can occur in the first three months of life,E,Pertussis can occur at any time in a child without immunity to the condition who is exposed. It is highly contagious. The whoop may not be seen and apnoeic episodes can occur as a feature. Although a lymphocytosis is observed the diagnosis is confirmed by culture of the organism in nasal secretions. There is no reported association with bronchiolitis obliterans. Erythromycin may assist in elimination of the organism from nasal secretions.
pediatrics,37,A 16-year-old female is found to be hypertensive at 26 weeks of her first pregnancy.    Blood pressure 144/92 mmHg   Dipstick urine +++ proteinuria   Serum creatinine 80 µmol/L   24 hour urine collection 1.2 g of protein/d    What is the most appropriate management?,Methyldopa,Labetalol,Nifedipine,Ramipril,Re-measure blood pressure in one week,B,"This patient has pre-eclampsia which is pregnancy-induced hypertension with proteinuria with or without oedema; a multisystem disorder originating in the placenta. As BP is greater than 140/90 mmHg with associated proteinuria she needs admission for observation and monitoring of the following:  BP biochemistry daily weight fluid balance, and urinary protein.  Oral labetalol would be the agent of choice to control hypertension. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) are contraindicated in pregnancy due to deleterious effects on renal development. ACE2, betablockers and diuretics should also be avoided. "
pediatrics,38,"A 4-year-old girl presents with fever 38.9°C for six days, associated with submandibular swelling. On examination you note an ill-looking, feverish (38.6°C) girl sitting on her mother's lap. She has an erythematous rash all over her body, hyperaemic lips and pharynx, cervical lymphadenopathy (2 cm in diameter), and conjunctival infection without exudates. The mother is upset because on the first day of fever she was diagnosed with pharyngitis and given co-amoxiclav without improvement, in addition to the rash that appeared one day after giving the antibiotic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Measles,Scarlet fever,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,B,"Kawasaki disease is a self-limiting acute vasculitis that is characterised by fever for more than five days, in addition to four of the following five clinical features:  polymorphic rash non-exudative conjunctivitis mucosal erythema with strawberry tongue desquamation of the hands and feet, and unilateral large cervical lymphadenopathy.  It is diagnosed clinically with some supporting laboratory tests. Fever with rash is a common presentation in the paediatric population. Therefore, accurate information about each disease is needed to formulate a diagnosis. Although infectious mononucleosis can have a similar presentation, there are more criteria that make Kawasaki more likely, bearing in mind that in Kawasaki, the rash may appear in any day of the illness. The rash of measles does not flare up before the third day of fever, in addition to the coryzal symptoms. Whereas in scarlet fever, a good improvement with co-amoxiclav is expected. In Stevens-Johnson syndrome there will be a worse presentation with a very painful rash. "
pediatrics,39,A mother is concerned as her 2-year-old daughter is not speaking yet. The daughter has a history of otitis media and she has had three grommet insertions. Her daughter is not responding to her name or any sounds and has a high pitched scream. ENT examination is normal. What is your next step and the reasoning behind it?,Ask the mother to observe the child for another month and see if she starts to speak in that time - there is no urgency to address the problem,Prescribe some analgesia for the mother’s headache and reassure her as she is upset and overly anxious,Refer to an audiologist as soon as possible as the child requires urgent assessment of her hearing,Refer to a developmental paediatrician as the child has a developmental delay,Refer to the child’s regular ENT service for further middle ear assessment,C,"Delayed language development in a child should be an immediate alert to formally assess hearing. All aspects of the audiological pathway must be tested - outer, middle and inner ear and a formal audiogram should be obtained. This should be treated as a 'hearing emergency' as the plasticity of language development pathways declines significantly from around six months of age until around seven years. The later the detection and initiation of an appropriate management programme, the poorer the outcomes of the intervention."
pediatrics,40,"Jenny, a 6-year-old girl who developed blistering of her skin following minor knocks, was diagnosed with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa after her parents were both found to be carriers of the trait. What is the chance of a patient with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa dying from the effects of squamous cell carcinoma?",20%,40%,60%,80%,100%,D,"Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are highly aggressive in patients with epidermolysis bullosa (EB). Non-UV related SCCs are the leading cause of death in patients with recessive EB. There are three main types of epidermolysis bullosa:  Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa Epidermolysis bullosa simplex Junctional epidermolysis bullosa.  There are also many subtypes within these main types. The goal of treatment is to prevent blisters from forming and complications. How much treatment is needed depends on how severe the disease is. Recommendations often include avoiding skin damage (trauma) and hot environments. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is the most serious complication of EB within adults, especially those with dystrophic EB. By mid-adulthood, nearly all will have had at least one SCC, and nearly 80% will have died of metastatic SCC despite aggressive surgical resection. When compared with SCCs arising within the normal population, the remarkably high risk of occurrence of and then death from SCCs among EB patients suggests likely differences in pathogenesis. "
pediatrics,41,"A 7-year-old child attends the clinic for asthma review. She is currently stable on 100 mcg inhaled beclomethasone BD and PRN salbutamol. Her mother has noted a significant improvement in her nocturnal cough and she is once again able to take part in class sporting activities. On examination her BP is 95/60 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular, she is of normal height and weight, and there is no wheeze on auscultation of her chest. Her mother is worried about significant adrenal suppression and wants to stop the inhaled steroids. Above what daily dose of inhaled beclomethasone is some impact on adrenal function noted?",100 mcg,200 mcg,400 mcg,800 mcg,1600 mcg,C,"The answer is 400 mcg. The effect of inhaled steroids on adrenal cortical function has been assessed with both measurement of morning cortisol (demonstrating a dip below normal levels), and with stimulation testing. Reports suggest that at doses above 400 mcg/day beclomethasone, some effect on adrenal function may be seen. For this reason, a step down approach is emphasised in the asthma guidelines, such that when a child's asthma symptoms are controlled, a step down in dose to the lowest appropriate, should take place."
pediatrics,42,"A 5-year-old girl presents with pallor and lethargy. This has been worsening over the last few weeks. Apart from occasional abdominal pain with dark stools from time to time, she has otherwise been well. She was born at 40+5/40 weighing 3.5 kg and there were no neonatal problems. On examination she has pale conjunctivae, but looks generally well. Her height and weight are on the 25th centile. Temperature is 36.5°C, HR is 95/min and RR 15/min. She has a 2/6 ejection murmur at the left sternal edge. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Dietary iron deficiency,"Haemaglobinopathies eg Sickle, Thalassaemia",Malignancy,Marrow failure,Occult blood loss,E,"The history suggests isolated anaemia, progressing over several months. The dark stools and abdominal pain suggest an occult source of bleeding from the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Potential sources include:  oesophagitis peptic ulcer Meckel's diverticulum, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.  Investigation may include:  full blood count and film Meckel's scan, or upper GI endoscopy."
pediatrics,43,A 9-year-old girl is referred to dermatology clinic by her GP. She has recently had rapid hair loss over her scalp occurring in round or oval patches that are well defined. Her mother is worried as now the fine hair over her body is starting to disappear. With which of the following is this condition associated?,Acne,Crohn's disease,Down's syndrome,Hyperpigmentation,Myotonic dystrophy,C,"Alopecia areata is as described above - a rapid and complete loss of hair in round or oval patches that are well defined over the scalp and body. These disappear to show underlying normal skin. It is associated with nail changes such as pits, ridge, opacification, dystrophy, cataracts or lens opacification, but not acne. It is also associated with autoimmune diseases such as Hashimoto thyroiditis, ulcerative colitis (not Crohn's disease), Addison disease, pernicious anaemia, myasthenia gravis and vitiligo. An increased incidence is also seen in children with Down's syndrome."
pediatrics,44,What is the most common cause of constipation in a 5-year-old child?,Cow's milk protein intolerance,Functional,Hirschsprung's,Hypercalcaemia,Iron supplements,B,"Most childhood constipation is functional (idiopathic constipation), that is, constipation that has no physical or physiological cause. Constipation is defined as having a stool that is difficult or painful to pass and often associated with soiling. Soiling is common if associated with megarectum. It should also be distinguished from encopresis (stooling in inappropriate times/places). Causes of chronic constipation: Social:  Lack of privacy Lack of exercise Poor diet Overfeeding in infancy Problems with school toilets, and Changes in routine/lifestyle (for example, new sibling).  Psychological:  Poor bowel habit - ignoring the urge or withholding, and Previous difficult toileting experience.  Physical:  Neuropathic - Hirschsprung's (usually presents neonatally), spina bifida, neurofibromatosis, tethered cord Endocrine/metabolic - hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, coeliac Connective tissue disorders - scleroderma, Ehlers-Danlos, systemic lupus erythematosus Cow's milk protein intolerance Lead or mercury poisoning Meconium ileus equivalent Anatomic malformation, imperforate anus (neonatal), anal stenosis, pelvic mass Medications - analgesics, iron supplements, anticonvulsants, antispasmodics, antacids Underweight/overweight Fever/dehydration Immobility Position for defecation Local pathology, for example, anal fissure, and Consider child abuse.

pediatrics,45,A 10-year-old boy with a history of asthma presents to the Emergency department with an asthma exacerbation which requires hospital admission. He has been admitted five times in the last year despite the fact that he regularly takes his steroid inhaler. Upon discharge you are asked to counsel the family about asthma management. On discharge examination you notice that the boy looks overweight. His BMI is greater than95th percentile. You have checked the adherence and inhaler technique and they were appropriate. While explaining to the family about the need to increase the dose of inhaled steroids the mother states that she feels that her son's condition would improve by lowering his weight. What is the next step in the management plan?,Lifestyle modification and counselling,Prescribe oral metformin,Reassure the mother that being overweight does not affect asthma,Refer for bariatric surgery,Refer to a paediatric respiratory specialist,A,"Childhood obesity is a common comorbid condition that affects patients psychologically and physically. It is associated with a worse prognosis for several diseases including asthma. It is generally hard to treat, and lifestyle modification and counselling remain the mainstay of treatment. The first step in the management of childhood obesity is by modifying lifestyle and counselling. This is true even in the most severe cases. The use of pharmacotherapy in treating childhood obesity can be considered as a second line of treatment if the lifestyle modification and counselling did not improve the patient's condition. Bariatric surgery is available for morbidly obese adolescents, and the success and complications of this procedure in adolescents are undergoing extensive study. Referral to a paediatric respiratory specialist is the fifth step in the management of asthma according to the British Thoracic Society, while increasing the dose of inhaled steroids is the fourth step. Therefore, it is wise to see the effect of increasing inhaled steroids dose before deciding to refer the patient to a respiratory paediatrician. "
pediatrics,46,"A 3-year-old boy was referred to cardiology clinic by his GP who heard a murmur while listening to his chest during a cold. The cardiologist explains to him and his parent that the condition he has is the commonest congenital heart defect, accounting for almost one 1/3 of all congenital heart problems. He explains that he can hear a murmur all over the chest wall, as a result of a 'shunt' through his heart caused by a hole in one of the walls and that it is reassuring that the murmur is loud as it suggests a small defect. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic stenosis,Ostium primum atrial septal defect,Ostium secundum atrial septal defect,Pulmonary stenosis,Ventricular septal defect,E,"VSD is the most common congenital heart defect, accounting for approximately 30% of all congenital heart disease. It affects all four chambers. Patients with small defects are asymptomatic. Examination in these cases reveal:  Patient looks well, normal pulses, blood pressure, saturations Pansystolic murmur loudest at lower left sternal edge, heard all over chest wall.  Treatment is needed if there are haemodynamic symptoms. In haemodynamic significance:  Murmur may be softer (implies larger lesion) Displaced apex beat (indicates volume loading due to large left to right shunt) Hyperactive praecordium and thrill at lower left sternal edge Diastolic murmur at apex (increased blood flow into left ventricle from pulmonary veins during diastole) Loud S2 (increased pulmonary blood flow- pulmonary hypertension) Symptoms of cardiac failure Effects on growth Cardiomegaly ECG - left ventricular hypertrophy CXR- cardiomegaly, enlarged pulmonary arteries, increased vascular markings from pulmonary oedema.  Eighty per cent close spontaneously. Atrial septal defects (ASD) are \'shunts\' through the heart, but ostium secundum atrial septal defects are the most common type of ASD and account for only approximately 7%. Pulmonary stenosis and aortic stenosis are both obstructive problems and cause turbulent flow."
pediatrics,47,A mother comes with her 15 months child. Which of the following will bother you?,Shies away from strangers,Can walk but not run,Vocabulary consists of only 2 meaningless words,She can’t make a sentence,None,C,At 15 months the child can clearly say 5 words and his first meaningful clear word he says at 12 months
pediatrics,48,"A 16-year-old female weighing 80 kg presents with a six month history of excessive weight gain and weakness. On examination she had central obesity with abdominal striae, a blood pressure of 178/96 mmHg and proximal muscle weakness. Urinalysis showed glucose ++. What is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient?",1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test,9 am plasma cortisol concentration,24 hour urinary free cortisol concentration,ACTH concentration,A short Synacthen test,C,"This patient is likely to have Cushing's syndrome. It is a difficult choice between an overnight dexamethasone suppression test and the urine free cortisol estimation and there are no clear national guidelines regarding which is best. However, Prague et al.^1 state that if the clinical suspicion of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is high then either a 24 hour urinary free cortisol (if the patient has normal renal function) or a late night salivary cortisol are the most likely to make a diagnosis. If the clinical suspicion is low and the aim is to exclude Cushing's syndrome then late night salivary cortisol or an overnight dexamethasone suppression test are more appropriate due to their higher sensitivities. 9 am cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations will not confirm the diagnosis. A short Synacthen test is used to confirm hypoadrenalism. "
pediatrics,49,A woman with phenotypically normal parents has two brothers with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. She experiences mild muscle weakness in her legs. Which of the following mechanisms is most likely to be directly involved?,Germline mosaicism,Mutation near the pseudoautosomal region of the Y chromosome,New mutation in this woman,Nondisjunction of her mother's X chromosomes,Skewed X inactivation,E,Skewed X inactivation is responsible for the weakness in some female carriers of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
pediatrics,50,"The midwives ask you to see urgently a neonate who looks blue. Despite giving high flow oxygen, his oxygen saturations and blood gas results do not improve. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Coarctation of the aorta,Ostium primum atrial septal defect,Ostium secundum atrial septal defect,Pulmonary valve stenosis,Tricuspid atresia,E,"Tricuspid atresia is correct. It is an example of a cyanotic cardiac defect. The other answer options are incorrect as they are all acyanotic cardiac defects. The hyperoxia test (give high flow oxygen and see if the partial pressure of oxygen improves) is a crude test to determine whether the cyanosis has a respiratory or cardiac cause. Cyanotic congenital heart disease (5Ts)  Transposition of great arteries Truncus arteriosus Tetralogy of Fallot Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage Tricuspid atresia Pulmonary atresia.  Decreased pulmonary blood flow:  Tricuspid atresia Pulmonary atresia Ebstein's anomaly Tetralogy of Fallot.  Poor mixing:  Transposition of great arteries.  Common mixing:  Truncus arteriosis Double outlet right ventricle Total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage Univentricular heart (often causes mild, difficult to detect cyanosis)."
pediatrics,51,A 2-year-old male child is brought to the Emergency department by his mother. He has been unable to bear weight since a fall from a chair this morning. He is tender over the mid-tibia but there is no obvious limb deformity. What is the x ray most likely to reveal?,Angulated fracture,Compound fracture,Epiphyseal fracture,No fracture likely,Spiral fracture,E,"This child has most likely a spiral fracture as he is tender in the mid tibia, and there is no obvious deformity. The injury is commonly caused by a twisting movement along the long axis of the bone which would have been caused by the fall."
pediatrics,52,"A 16-year-old male presents with a day history of malaise, weakness and vomiting. He was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus three years previously. Which one of the following supports a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?",A serum standard bicarbonate of 10 mmol/L (22-26),A random serum glucose 14 mmol/L (4.5-6.4),Abdominal pain at onset,Decreased appetite in the past few days,Shallow respirations,A,"Abdominal pain at onset is an unusual but recognised feature, particularly in children. However it does not support a diagnosis of DKA. 'Normoglycaemic DKA' can occur and a glucose of 14 is compatible with a diagnosis, but is not suggestive as one might expect to find these sort of concentrations with diabetes per se. The low plasma bicarbonate is highly suggestive of a metabolic acidosis. Usually patients are unwell with infections and anorexia. Fasting is itself associated with the presence of ketones in the urine but not necessarily ketoacidosis. Respiratory compensation leads to rapid deep (Kussmaul's) breathing."
pediatrics,53,A 2-year-old child comes to the clinic with a lower respiratory tract infection. He is allergic to penicillin and you plan to start him on clarithromycin. He is treated with long term antiemetic/prokinetic therapy for reflux disease. Which of the following antiemetics would raise particular concern when used in combination with clarithromycin?,Cyclizine,Diphenhydramine,Domperidone,Ginger,Promethazine,C,"Domperidone is an antidopaminergic antiemetic/prokinetic agent and is used in the treatment of children with reflux disease. It has however been recently subject to a CSM warning about long QT syndrome. Given that macrolide antibiotics are also implicated with respect to long QT, co-prescription in this situation is best avoided. Cyclizine, diphenhydramine and promethazine are antihistaminergic antiemetics and are not thought to be associated with long QT. Ondansetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and is centrally acting, but has also been associated with QT prolongation. Ginger has been demosntrated to be an effective anti-emetic in pregnancy-related nausea but not as an anti-emetic otherwise."
pediatrics,54,"A 2-year-old boy presents with a tender red swelling in the left side of the neck. He had a sore throat seven days ago. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 37.4°C, respiratory rate 20/min and pulse 100/min. He is generally well. His head is held to the left. There is a raised erythematous lump in the left anterior triangle, which is tender. The throat, which is difficult to examine, appears normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial adenitis,Hodgkin lymphoma,Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Streptococcal pharyngitis,A,"The erythema makes a bacterial infection most likely, so the differential lies between streptococcal pharyngitis or bacterial adenitis. In addition to a sore red throat +/- pus, the former may be associated with tender glands, but these are not usually red. Glandular fever may appear similarly. Hodgkin's nodes tend to be large, multiple and rubbery. In Kawasaki disease the glands are usually multiple, un-inflamed, and associated with multiple other clinical features (more than five day fever, rash, cracked lips, peripheral oedema then peeling, non-purulent conjunctivitis)."
pediatrics,55,A 12-year-old girl presented to her GP with sudden onset of weak legs that developed four days after she had flu. He suspected Guillain-Barré syndrome and referred her immediately to the hospital for further examination and tests. Which of the following results would be most consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome?,"Ascending paralysis, low CSF protein and high CSF white cell count, conduction block in nerve conduction studies","Ascending paralysis, high CSF protein and normal CSF white cell count, conduction block in nerve conduction studies","Ascending paralysis, normal CSF protein and normal CSF white cell count, conduction block in nerve conduction studies","Descending paralysis, low CSF protein and high CSF white cell count, conduction block in nerve conduction studies","Descending paralysis high CSF protein and normal CSF white cell count, conduction block in nerve conduction studies",B,"Guillain-Barré syndrome is an acute, inflammatory, post-infectious polyneuropathy. A prodromal malaise with vomiting, headache, fever and limb pains is rapidly surmounted by a progressive and (usually) ascending paralysis. This can lead to respiratory dysfunction, and as such, the acute presentation can be a neurological emergency. The incidence of the Guillain-Barré syndrome is 2 per 100,000 per year. Key investigations in Guillain-Barré syndrome show:  CSF protein is elevated in most patients after the second or third week of illness. The gamma globulin fraction is usually raised. Cells, usually monocytic, are found in 20% of cases, but the characteristic appearance is one of an elevated protein level without cells. Nerve conduction - prolonged conduction velocities are a late phenomenon Virology - occasionally, rising titres to specific viruses may be found Campylobacter serology should be performed as positive titres identify a group with a poorer prognosis Forced vital capacity measurements should be used to assess the progression of the disease and predict the need for respiratory support.  The results that would be most consistent with a diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome are:  Ascending paralysis High CSF protein and normal CSF white cell count, and Conduction block in nerve conduction studies.  The CF (CSF) typically shows a high protein count without an associated pleocytosis. If the CSF white cell count is consistently high, an alternative infectious cause should be sought. "
pediatrics,56,"A 5-year-old boy presents with a three day history of smoky coloured urine. This is not associated with dysuria. He had tonsillitis four weeks ago. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he is apyrexial and well. Respiratory rate is 14/min and pulse is 90/min, with a blood pressure of 100/80 mmHg. Abdomen is non-tender with no masses. Urine dipstix shows protein 3+ and blood 4+. Microscopy shows red cell and granular casts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glomerulonephritis,Haemorrhagic cystitis,Renal stone,Urinary tract infection,Wilm’s tumour,A,The history of throat infection followed by haematuria and proteinuria and red cell casts suggest post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. A throat swab and antistreptolysin-O test (ASOT) should be performed. Complement level (C3) is often low.
pediatrics,57,"You see a 9-year-old girl in clinic. She has been referred by her GP who has concerns that she is obese and continuing to gain weight. Using the UK-WHO growth charts, which of the following is correct?",A child on the 10^th BMI centile is classified as underweight,A child on the 80^th BMI centile is classified as clinically obese,A child on the 98^th BMI centile is classified as clinically obese,A child with a BMI of 25 kg/m^2 is classified as obese,A child with a BMI of 30 kg/m^2 is classified as overweight,C,"BMI is the most frequently used measure for child obesity prevalence in the United Kingdom. Children are usually classified as overweight or obese by comparing their BMI with a reference population that describes the distribution of BMI within a population by both age and sex. This is necessary because a child's BMI changes with age and sex so fixed thresholds as applied to adults (for example, 25 and 30 kg/m^2) cannot be used. Thresholds are quoted using BMI centiles or z scores. Using the new recommended UK WHO centile chart, the following thresholds are used:    Underweight 2nd centile   Overweight 91st centile   Obese 98th centile    Children on the 80th or 10th BMI centiles would fall within normal range.

There is no obvious cause clinically. Known causes include:  Infection Gastro-oesophageal reflux Electrolyte disturbance Anaemia Convulsions, and Intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH).  Initial assessment is to search for these. The commonest diagnosis, by exclusion, is apnoea of prematurity. "
pediatrics,59,A 17-year-old female who is 16 weeks pregnant reports that her elder brother has vitamin D resistant rickets. What is the most likely mode of inheritance of this condition?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance,Autosomal recessive,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,D,"Vitamin D resistant rickets is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Therefore an affected female will transmit the disease to 50% of her sons and 50% of her daughters. An affected male will transmit the condition to all of his daughters but none of his sons. In this case as the mother is unaffected, therefore there is no risk of the condition being passed to her unborn child."
pediatrics,60,Which one of the following conditions is DNA analysis the most useful diagnostic test?,Adult polycystic kidney disease,Down's syndrome,Huntington's chorea,Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy,Klinefelter's syndrome,C,"Klinefelter's syndrome and Down's syndrome are diagnosed principally by chromosomal analysis/karyotype - XXY in the former and trisomy C21 or translocation in the latter. A trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the Huntington gene is diagnostic of Huntington's disease. The majority of cases of HOCM are autosomal dominantly inherited yet defective genes are located on a variety of chromosomes. DNA linkage analysis is used to assist in the diagnosis of adult PCKD but the presence of multiple copies continues to complicate the development of reagents for direct genetic testing, at least of the 70% of PKD1 that is replicated elsewhere."
pediatrics,61,Which of the following is true regarding head injury in children?,An uncommon cause of trauma death in children aged 1-15 years,Resulting in primary brain damage may be caused by diffuse axonal injury,Resulting in primary brain damage may be caused by ischaemia due to poor cerebral perfusion,Resulting in secondary brain damage is usually caused by hypercapnoea,Under one year is most commonly due to a road traffic collision,B,"Head injury is the commonest cause of trauma death in children aged 1-15 years. In infancy (up to 12 months of age) the commonest cause of fatal head injury is child abuse. Primary brain damage is caused by:  Cerebral lacerations Cerebral contusions Dural sac tears, and Diffuse axonal injury.  Secondary damage occurs because of the consequences of the brain injury, or from associated injuries and stress. Causes of this include ischaemia from poor cerebral perfusion due to raised intracranial pressure, and ischaemia due to blood loss and hypotension. Hypoxia and hypoglycaemia are other causes."
pediatrics,62,"A 7-month-old girl presents with fever and a rash. She was completely well until five days ago, when she developed a slight cold.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",CMV infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Measles,Parvovirus infection,Roseola infantum,E,"The history of a well child with high fever for a few days followed by resolution of fever at around the time of appearance of a rose-coloured rash is characteristic of roseola infantum. Since the introduction of the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine, this is by far the commonest cause of a measles-like rash. The peak incidence is six to eighteen months. 5% develop febrile seizures. It is caused by human herpes virus 6 and 7."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV infection,Isolated IgA deficiency,Cystic fibrosis,Severe combined immune deficiency,Tuberculosis,D,"The history is suggestive of severe failure to thrive associated with chronic respiratory symptoms, and chronic diarrhoea with cryptosporidia detected. Immunodeficiency, either congenital (eg. SCID) or acquired (e.g. HIV) should be suspected. The latter is less likely due to the lack of risk factors and lack of liver, spleen and lymph nodes. Isolated IgA deficiency is common but often asymptomatic. TB is unlikely due to lack of risk factors.   (C) "
pediatrics,64,A 4-year-old female is referred to the general paediatric clinic as her weight is above the 99.6th centile for her age. Her height is on the 50th centile. Her parents are both of average height with BMIs in the normal range. She has a 6-year-old brother whose height and weight are both on the 50th-75th centiles. Her parents state that they cannot stop her eating. They prepare healthy meals and only allow chocolate treats occasionally but their daughter raids the cupboards whenever they let her out of their sight. They have resorted to padlocking the cupboards but their daughter cries and complains she is hungry all the time. The parents state that their daughter started main stream school six months ago and whilst she enjoys it she is struggling to keep up with the other children academically. Which feature would make a diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome more likely?,A history of neonatal hypotonia,The presence of a Wilm's tumour,The presence of associated hyperinsulinism,The presence of polydactyly,The presence of retinitis pigmentosa,A,"Prader-Willi syndrome is a result of a deletion of the paternally inherited long arm of chromosome 15q. The clinical features of Prader-Willi incude  Neonatal hypotonia with feeding difficulties Food seeking behaviour from early childhood which is often persistent and results in obesity Learning disabilities (IQ 40-70) Hypogonadism A tendency to diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance and Characteristic facies (anti-mongoloid slant, carp mouth, abnormal ear lobes, olive shaped eyes).  Hyperinsulinism and Wilm's tumours are associated with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Retinitis pigmentosa and the presence of polydactyly/clinodactyly are associated with with Laurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome."
pediatrics,65,You see a 2-year-old boy in clinic who has severe profound deafness (he only hears sounds greater than90dB at frequencies of 2 and 4 KHz without hearing aids). His parents are worried that he does not seem to be hearing adequately with acoustic aids and ask about cochlear implants. What is the recommended management of a child this age regarding cochlear implants?,Bilateral cochlear implants,Cochlear implant in one ear and acoustic aid in the other,Optimise the acoustic aids,Sequential cochlear implants,Unilateral cochlear implant only,A,"NICE guidance on Hearing impairment - cochlear implants (TA166) recommends simultaneous bilateral cochlear implants in children. This is different from adults where unilateral implant is recommended. As part of the assessment for cochlear implants children and adults should also have had a valid trial of an acoustic hearing aid for at least three months (unless contraindicated or inappropriate). Adequate benefit of acoustic aids for children means developing speech, language and listening skills appropriate to age, developmental stage and cognitive ability."
pediatrics,66,You are asked to see a child who has been brought in with bruising. The Emergency Department doctor is concerned about the pattern of injury. Which one of the following injuries is most likely to be consistent with an accidental injury?,Bruising on the cheek of a 3-week-old,Bruising on the shins of a 4-month-old,"Burns, that look like splash marks on back of hand of a 2-year-old",Burns with a stocking distribution on the leg,Fractured femur in a 6-week-old,C,"Bruising is the most common manifestation of physical abuse. Patterns of suspicious bruising include bruises found in non-walking children, those found in well-padded areas such as thighs, cheeks, or buttocks. Accidental bruises are usually anterior and over bony prominences. Precisely dating bruises is difficult. An underlying medical reason for bruising such as a bleeding diathesis should always be considered. The pattern of a burn and scald can be very informative when trying to ascertain if a burn is accidental or intentional. Intentional burns are unlikely if:  agent is hot drink irregular margin and burn depth no glove/stocking distribution asymmetrical distribution on lower limbs, or involves head/neck/upper body.  Approximately 30% of childhood fractures are thought to be inflicted. Before the age of 1 year, the figure rises to 75%, especially when considering rib fractures. A fracture in a non-mobile child always warrants careful attention. "
pediatrics,67,"A 3-year-old child presents with delayed speech. Although he seems to understand full sentences and commands he says only occasional single words. He was born at 41/40 weighing 3.4 kg and there were no neonatal problems. He is fully immunised, on no medications, and comes from a middle class articulate family. On examination he is on the 25th centile for height, weight and OFC. There are no specific abnormalities to find. ENT examination is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Autism,Global developmental delay,Impaired hearing,Pervasive developmental disorder,"Speech delay, isolated",E,"The history is of isolated speech delay in a child who apparently hears normally. Hearing should be formally checked, as it is the commonest reason for speech delay. In this case the problem involves mainly expression rather than reception of speech. Such speech problems may interfere significantly with schooling."
pediatrics,68,Which one of the following statements is correct:,Children with diabetes mellitus always require treatment with insulin,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a cause of ambiguous genitalia in the newborn,Dyshormonogenesis is the commonest cause of congenital hypothyroidism,In patients with short stature (height below the 3rd centile) one should always screen for growth hormone efficiency,Onset of puberty is usually earlier in boys than in girls,B,"The commonest causes of congenital hypothyroidism are thyroid aplasia/hypoplasia or ectopic thyroid gland. Short stature may be the consequence of multiple factors and growth hormone deficiency is identified in a minority of patients. Growth velocity, parental height, intercurrent illnesses and use of drugs such as steroids may be more relevant. In females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, excessive adrenal androgens result in virilisation and ambiguous genitalia. The incidence of type 2 diabetes in children is rising, and children may be treated with weight loss/diet and or metformin. Also in the condition known as MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young, autosomal dominant, defective insulin secretion) oral hypoglycaemics are used initially. The onset of puberty is delayed by approximately two years in males, when compared to females."

pediatrics,71,"Which of the following is a likely explanation for the fact that some 45,X conceptions (Turner's syndrome) survive to term?",Delayed age of onset of the disorder,Imprinting on the X chromosome,Incomplete X inactivation,Germline mosaicism in one of the parents,Mosaicism in the fetus,E,Mosaicism in the fetus would explain why a Turner's syndrome baby could survive to term.
pediatrics,72,"A 3-month-old boy presents with fever, vomiting and unresponsiveness. The fever began 12 hours ago, but has rapidly progressed. Two hours ago he developed a rash, initially blanching and pink, but now purple. He had a full term normal delivery and no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 38.7°C, respiratory rate is 30/min, heart rate 150/min. He responds to voice. Peripheries are cool to the elbows and capillary refill time is four seconds. He has an extensive purplish rash, with irregular well-demarcated spots up to 4 cm across over his trunk, arms and legs. This does not blanch. What is the most likely organism?",Haemophilus influenzae,Listeria monocytogenes,Neisseria meningitidis,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,C,"The history is of purpura fulminans, with rapidly progressive non-blanching purpuric rash. The likely diagnosis is septicaemic shock. Meningococcal septicaemia is commonest, though H. influenzae type B and pneumococcus can cause a similar picture. He requires intensive care immediately, with airway protection, consideration of intubation, 100% O2 and rapid resuscitation with large volumes of fluid. Multiple doses of 20 ml/kg may be needed to restore intravascular volume because of the associated capillary leak."
pediatrics,73,Which of the following statements concerning Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 hydroxylase deficiency is correct:,It causes testicular enlargement,It has an autosomal recessive inheritance,It is more easily diagnosed in boys than girls,It results in delayed fusion of epiphyses,There is increased aldosterone secretion,B,"The condition causes virilisation in the female (male secondary sexual characteristics e.g. clitoromegaly, ambiguous genitalia) and in males sexual development may be entirely normal or pseudo-precocious puberty develops. Delayed epiphyseal fusion is not a feature. Aldosterone deficiency causes salt wasting in this condition. The disease has an autosomal recessive inheritance. The disease is far more easily diagnosed in females who develop abnormal genitalia, than males who may have no clinical signs. It causes pseudo-precocious puberty, driven by androgens produced in the adrenal. This is in contrast to true precocious puberty, driven by the HPA. "
pediatrics,74,A health visitor makes a routine visit to a 4-month-old breastfed child and her mother to discuss weaning. Which one of the following should the mother be advised regarding breastfeeding and weaning?,There is no reason for vitamin D supplementation in breast fed infants,She should avoid giving him honey until 12 months of age because of the risk of infant botulism,She should avoid progesterone-only contraceptive pills while breast feeding as they adversely affect milk volume,She should continue breast feeding as part of a mixed diet until he is at least 4 years of age,She should not introduce cows milk into her baby's diet until 12 months of age,B,"The World Health Organization's (WHO) infant feeding recommendation advises that babies are fed only breast milk for their first 6 months, and that breastfeeding then be continued as part of a mixed diet until the age of 2 years. Breastfeeding provides many health benefits for both baby and mother. A vitamin D supplement is recommended for all breastfeeding women and for breastfed babies. Vitamin D supplements are recommended for all children from 6 months to 6 years of age, as per RCPCH guidance. Cows' milk can be introduced into a baby's diet from the age of 6 months in cooking, but should not be given to drink until 12 months of age. Cows' milk fats and protein are harder to digest and cows' milk contains insufficient levels of vitamin E and fatty acids compared to infant formula or breast milk. Contraceptive pills containing oestrogen should be avoided as they have an adverse effect on milk volume, but progesterone-only pills do not affect supply. WHO recommend breastfeeding should be continued as part of a mixed diet until the age of 2 years. "
pediatrics,75,A 7-year-old girl complains of a sore throat. She has experienced this symptom on two previous occasions over the past three years. Her tonsils are large and congested.  Which of the following statements is correct?,An ENT opinion should be sought to advise whether to recommend tonsillectomy,Further sore throats should be treated aggressively with antibiotics to lessen the risks of sub-acute bacterial endocarditis,"If antibiotics are given, tetracycline is the drug of choice",Petechiae on the palate suggest infectious mononucleosis,White exudates on the tonsils indicates a viral infection,D,"This question describes a child with an upper respiratory tract infection. This is extremely common and in most cases the cause is viral and treatment is conservative only. Tonsillectomy is considered in children with a history of recurrent tonsillitis causing them to miss significant time at school. There are no fixed numbers of episodes to justify tonsillectomy but 5 over 2 years would be considered reasonable. If antibiotics are required to treat a bacterial infection, penicillin is the drug of choice as the usual organism is a group A Streptococcus. Tetracycline is contraindicated in children, due to the side effects affecting bones and teeth. Palatal petechiae are often seen in patients with glandular fever."
pediatrics,76,"You are asked advice by a young professional couple, Mr and Mrs X. Mrs X is nine weeks pregnant. Mr X's brother and his partner had a child with cystic fibrosis. As a result, Mr X was screened and found to carry the DF508 mutation for cystic fibrosis. Mrs X declines to be tested.

pediatrics,77,"A 4-year-old girl who has had a runny nose for 12 hours has woken up 2’oclock in the morning with difficulty in breathing, a barking cough. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Bronchiectasis,Bronchiolitis,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Croup,E,"Age, runny nose, dyspnea, and barking cough are suggestive features of croup"
pediatrics,78,"A 12-year-old girl presents to a local hospital with a history of a one hour generalised tonic clonic seizure. She does not respond to benzodiazepines or intravenous phenytoin and so is intubated with thiopentone induction and transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit. Her seizure terminates shortly thereafter and over the following 24 hours she is extubated and transferred to the paediatric ward. She is acutely confused and is hallucinating. Intermittently she makes sense and is coherent but then she lapses into periods of slurred and incomprehensible speech with disordered thought processes. Her mother states that one month prior to her seizure episode she had a stroke-like event which resolved within 24 hours, she has also had significant personality change over the last three months with outbursts of anger and aggression. Her blood tests are normal except for TSH of 19.6 mIU/L, fT4 of 10 pmol/L and elevated anti-thyroid antibodies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Graves' disease,Hashimoto's encephalopathy,Hyperthyroidism,Hypothyroidisim,Multinodular goitre,B,"Encephalopathy is a rare complication of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hashimoto's is also known as lymphocytic or autoimmune thyroiditis. It is the most common cause of thyroid disease in children and adolescents. It is four to seven times more common in girls than boys, and has a peak incidence in adolescence. It most commonly presents as goitre and growth retardation, some patients may be clinically hypothyroid but others may be clinically euthyroid with abnormal thyroid function tests. Occasionally children can show signs of hyperthyroidism such as irritability, hyperactivity and increased sweating even though their thyroid function tests are indicating hypothyroid or euthyroid status. Very occasionally Hashimoto's thyroiditis can co-exist with Graves' disease but then these children will show evidence of hyperthyroidism on thyroid function testing. As Hashimoto's thyroiditis is autoimmune in nature it may present with features in other systems, particularly secondary to a Hashimoto's associated vasculitis which is what occurred in this patient resulting in her suffering a stroke-like episode, prolonged seizures and a degree of encephalopathy. In this case the patient has evidence of hypothyroidism on her thyroid function tests with a significantly raised TSH, despite her T4 being in the normal range. This therefore rules out hyperthryoidism and Graves' disease. There is no description of a goitre and so this diagnosis is unlikely. Hypothyroidism is also not the correct answer as hypothyroidism outside the context of autoimmune/Hashimoto's thyroiditis is unlikely to cause the associated neurological symptoms."
pediatrics,79,"A 7-year-old girl presents with extreme joint pain and swelling, initially affecting the right knee. She had a sore throat three weeks previously but has otherwise been well. She had a full term normal delivery and no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 37.8°C, respiratory rate 16/min, pulse 80/min and blood pressure 104/68 mmHg. She looks well and well perfused. She has exquisitely tender swelling of the left wrist and elbow. There is a low pitched mid diastolic murmur without added sounds .    White cell count 15 ×10^9/L (4-11)   ESR 96 mm/hr (0-20 mm/1st hr)   CRP 124 mg/L (less than10)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lyme disease,Osteomyelitis,Reactive arthritis,Rheumatic fever,Septic arthritis,D,"The history of sore throat followed by exquisitely painful migratory arthritis, heart murmur and elevated inflammatory indices point to acute rheumatic fever as the diagnosis here. The Duckett Jones criteria are divided into major and minor. Major criteria are:  migratory polyarthritis pancarditis chorea erythema marginatum, and nodules.  Minor criteria are:  fever arthralgia raised inflammatory indices, and prolonged PR interval.  Diagnosis is based on evidence of a recent streptococcal infection plus two major or one major and two minor criteria. In the acute disease the mitral valve may be thickened and the murmur heard is the so called Carey Coombes murmur, which is a mid diastolic rumble but there is no opening snap. Usually this is accompanied by a pan systolic murmur at the apex."
pediatrics,80,"A 6-month-old boy is brought to clinic by his parents. He had a fever for three days, and as this disappeared he was noted to have a rash. On examination he is noted to be apyrexial, but has a macular rash on the trunk and lower limbs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Erythema multiforme,Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Idiopathic thrombocytopenia,Meningococcal septicaemia,Roseola infantum,E,Roseola infantum is due to herpesvirus 6 and characteristically causes a macular rash with lymphadenopathy. Erythema multiforme characteristically causes target lesions with blistering. Idiopathic thrombocytopenia causes a petechial rash. Henoch-Schönlein purpura causes a purpuric rash on the buttocks and lower limbs. Meningococcal septicaemia causes a non-blanching purpuric rash.
pediatrics,81,"A 10-year-old is about to undergo an indirect inguinal hernia repair. The surgeon asks his SHO to mark the surface of the deep inguinal ring, prior to the procedure. What area should the SHO mark?",2 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine,3 cm above the greater trochanter,Halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle,Halfway between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis,Mid-inguinal point,C,"The deep ring is at the midpoint of the inguinal ligament, which is halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine and pubic tubercle. 2 cm below the anterior superior iliac spine and 3 cm above the greater trochanter are both too lateral. Halfway between the umbilicus and pubic symphysis is too medial. The mid-inguinal point is halfway between the pubic symphysis and the anterior superior iliac spine; this is where the femoral arteries are palpable and this can be used for femoral angioplasties. "
pediatrics,82,A 7-year-old girl with cystic fibrosis Is brought by her mother to the Emergency department following a massive haematemesis. Examination reveals that she is hypotensive and she has a tachycardia. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aorto-intestinal fistula,Bleeding oesophageal varices,Boerhaave’s syndrome,Mallory-Weiss tear,Perforated peptic ulcer,B,The most likely cause for this type of large upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage causing shock in a child of 7 years would be from bleeding oesophageal varices secondary to portal hypertension. Perforated ulcer is less likely. Mallory Weiss tear would not cause such catastrophic bleeding. Aorto-intestinal fistula is seen in older patients with aortic abdominal aneurysm. Boerhaave's syndrome is due to oesophageal rupture normally after severe vomiting.
pediatrics,83,"A 6-year-old boy presents with pruritic, excoriated papules on his genitalia, wrists and web spaces for the past three weeks. A scrape from a burrow in his web spaces reveals this picture.  What is your diagnosis?",Ctenocephalides canis (dog flea) bites,Fire ant bites,Molluscum contagiosum,Pediculosis,Scabies,E,"The picture shows a typical sarcoptes scabies mite as seen under the microscope. Common in children, patients present with extremely pruritic papules, especially on the genitalia, web spaces and wrists. The other conditions listed do not present with these symptoms and are not represented by the picture."
pediatrics,84,A 3-year-old boy has been referred to clinic due to poor sleeping habits. During the consultation the mother reports this is actually because for the last four weeks he wakes at night complaining of pain in his right hip and whilst walking she has noted he has developed an obvious limp on the same side. She also notes that he looks paler than usual and has lost his appetite. What is the likely diagnosis?,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Developmental dysplasia of the hip,Osteomyelitis,Septic arthritis,Transient synovitis,A,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the commonest leukaemia of childhood. As a group the leukaemias consist of over a third of all childhood cancers. Typically children present with  Pallor and tiredness (due to anaemia) Easy bruising (due to thrombocytopenia) and Increased infections (due to neutropenia).  In addition  Weight loss Loss of appetite Headaches Dizziness Blurred vision Nausea and vomiting.  In children who present with a new onset of limp and bony pain particularly at night you should have a high index of suspicion that the underlying diagnosis is leukaemia.
pediatrics,85,An 18-month-old child is referred to the ophthalmology clinic by the GP as the health visitor has noticed a squint. The mother states the squint is apparent all the time and not just when the child is tired or ill. She notes that the right eye appears to turn inwards when the child is trying to focus on an object. On the cover/uncover test the right eye appears to fix on the object when the left eye is covered. Upon uncovering the left eye the right eye remains fixed on the object and the left eye remains in a deviated position. Neurological assessment of the cranial nerves is normal. Select the option which best fits the squint described above?,"A latent, alternating, divergent, non-paralytic squint","A latent, unilateral, convergent, non-paralytic squint","A manifest, alternating, convergent, non-paralytic squint","A manifest, alternating, convergent, paralytic squint","A manifest, unilateral, convergent, non-paralytic squint",C,"A squint is a misalignment of the visual axis of one eye. It can be either latent (only there in times of stress, fatigue or illness) or manifest (present all the time). It can be convergent (the affected eye turns inward) or divergent (the affected eye turns outward). Squint may be unilateral/monocular where only one eye is used for fixation and the other eye consistently deviates - on the cover/uncover test when the unaffected eye is covered the squinting eye fixes on the object, when the unaffected eye is uncovered the unaffected eye fixes on the object and the squinting eye resumes its deviated position. Alternately squint may be alternating where the patient uses either eye for fixation while the other deviates - on the cover/uncover test the squinting eyes fixes on the object when the unaffected eye is covered, when the unaffected eye is uncovered it remains in a deviated position and the squinting eye remains fixed on the object. A paralytic squint is a result of weakness or paralysis of one or more extraocular muscles. This is much less common than non-paralytic squint which makes up the majority of congenital and infantile convergent squints."
pediatrics,86,A 8-year-old girl discloses to her mother that their next-door neighbour has been inserting his fingers into her vagina and touching her inappropriately for the last year. This last occurred two days ago. Her mother has brought her to the Emergency department and is clearly distraught just as the child is. The girl has no vaginal bleeding and there does not appear to be any acute treatment needed. What is the most important thing you should do next?,Call the police,Conduct a formal interview as evidence,Examine the child yourself to obtain forensic samples,Inform social services,Inform your consultant and discuss with sexual assault referral centre,E,"Clearly in any child safeguarding case, it is important to inform social services and your senior colleagues. In the instance of cases of sexual abuse occurring within three days of presenting to medical professionals, samples that may be used as forensic evidence may still be possible to obtain. Therefore, most geographical areas should have access to a sexual referral centre where an organised examination can take place with the police present. Most general paediatricians are not trained in how to examine the genitalia accurately and should not risk contaminating evidence, but they should ensure that the child does not need any acute treatment and control bleeding if this is present. It is not appropriate to conduct a formal interview as the police should carry this out and in most instances open questions or phrases such as 'tell me more about that' or 'what happened' are more appropriate."
pediatrics,87,A 4-year-old child presents with pain of spontaneous onset in his knee of 2 days duration. He has developed mild fever in the 2nd day. He can walk but has a limp. Examination: painful restriction in the right hip. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Osteosarcoma,Septic arthritis,TB arthritis,Exostosis,Osteomyelitis,B,Points in favour of diagnosis: i) Pain in joints (knee and hip). In osteeomyelitis there is no joint pain but pain in other parts of bone like shaft. ii) Fever iii) Painful restricted movement of joint
pediatrics,88,A 4-year-old child presents with repeated chest infections. He has yellow discoloration of sclera and the mother gives a history of diarrhea as well. What is the single investigation most likely to lead to a diagnosis?,Sweat chloride test,Anti-endomysialantiboides,LFT (liver function test),Jejunal biopsy,TFT (thyroid function test),A,"Repeated chest infections, and jaundice suggests diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. In the hepatobiliary system which is damaged in about 25 to 30% of the cystic fibrosis patients, malfunctioning secretion can cause liver disease and gall stones, leading to pain and jaundice. For cystic fibrosis sweat chloride test can be done"
pediatrics,89,A 3-month-old infant boy is brought to you by his mother who is concerned about a rash on his body. Which of the following supports a diagnosis of eczema?,Cold weather relieves the symptoms,Dermographism excludes the diagnosis,The rash has been present from birth,The rash is mainly on the extensor surfaces,The rash is pruritic,E,"It is unusual for the rash of infantile eczema to be present at birth and usually occurs around three months after birth. Pruritus is a typical feature and relief with warmer conditions may occur. Dermographism is also a feature. The rash tends to be on flexor surfaces, unlike psoriasis which is usually on extensor surfaces.  Treatment is with emollients usually, though steroid creams may be required for more severe cases. A family history of atopy, hay fever, asthma or eczema is found in the vast majority of cases."
pediatrics,90,"A term newborn infant is noted to have slight facial asymmetry. He was born by vaginal forceps delivery. He is breast feeding well and active in himself. His mother mentions that her 'eyes' are different colours. He is on the 75th centile for head circumference and weight. He handles well, moving all four limbs and neck normally, with no respiratory distress. There is a pale forceps mark noted on the left cheek. He has slight drooping of the left eyelid with a blue iris and pale brown iris in the right eye. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Congenital Horner's syndrome,Congenital pneumonia,Heterochromia iridis,Sternocleidomastoid tumour,Traumatic damage to nerves,A,"The most likely diagnosis is congenital Horner's syndrome, which is caused by lesion of the sympathetic tract. Signs are the quadrad of:  Ptosis Anyhydrosis Enophthalmos, and Pupil constriction.  This diagnosis is most likely in view of the signs of Horner's syndrome with heterochromia of the iris (as a result of impaired sympathetic supply affecting melanin pigmentation). This can be a spontaneous mutation or autosomal dominant; as in this case where the mother is also affected. SCM tumour and traumatic damage to nerves may also cause a Horner's syndrome, but are less likely in the presence of normal movements. The history of a traumatic delivery here is a distracter; examination suggests minimal trauma and would not explain the different coloured irises. Isolated heterochromia iridis can also be inherited, but is not associated with ptosis. Congenital pneumonia leading to a Horner's syndrome is very unlikely in a well baby."
pediatrics,91,"A 13-year-old girl presents to the clinic as her parents are concerned regarding a two month history of recurrent episodes of abdominal pain associated with loss of appetite and nausea. On further questioning the pain is quite severe, tends to occur in the mornings, is intermittent and can occur during holidays. Her weight is on the 50^th centile and no abnormalities are found on examination. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Abdominal migraine,Appendicitis,Crohn's disease,Mesenteric adenitis,School avoidance,A,"Of the options given, abdominal migraine is most likely. Abdominal migraine is an idiopathic disorder seen mainly in children. The symptoms are of recurrent episodes of midline abdominal pain with attacks lasting 1-72 hours and complete normality between episodes. The pain is of moderate to severe intensity and is felt in the midline of the abdomen, usually around the umbilicus, or poorly localised. The attacks of pain are usually accompanied by anorexia and nausea and about half of the patients will vomit with at least some attacks. Marked pallor is commonly noted during the attacks although some patients may appear flushed. The pain is severe enough to interfere with normal daily activities and many children describe their mood during the attack as one of intense misery. The attacks are self limiting and resolve spontaneously and patients are completely well and symptom free between attacks. This is unlikely to be school avoidance as the description is so episodic and it can occur outside school times."
pediatrics,92,A 4-year-old sister of a newborn baby develops cough diagnosed as pertussis by pernasal swab. The mother gives a history of being immunised as a child. Which of the following is correct management of the baby?,Erythromycin should be administered to the infant,Hyperimmune globulin is effective in protecting the infant,"Reassure the mother, as the risk to the infant depends on the immune status of the mother",The mother has no risk of acquiring the disease as she is immunised,The 4-year-old should be immediately immunised with an additional dose of pertussis vaccine,A,"Newborn infants exposed to pertussis are at considerable risk of being infected regardless of the immune status of the mother. Erythromycin may be effective in preventing or lessening the severity of the disease if administered during the preparoxysmal stage. Hyperimmune globulin is ineffective and not recommended. In contrast to other childhood infections, pertussis is not prevented by transplacentally acquired antibodies. Immunity declines with age and adults who were immunised in infancy are susceptible to infection. Immunisation against pertussis is unnecessary if the patient has culture proven pertussis."
pediatrics,93,"A 3-year-old girl presents with a history of fever, sore throat and difficulty in breathing, worsening over the past few hours. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. She has not received her primary immunisations because her parents 'don't believe in them'. On examination she has a temperature of 39.8°C, respiratory rate 20/min (mild stridor), and pulse 120/min. She sits forwards, drooling, talks with a soft voice, and looks flushed and anxious. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial tracheitis,Croup,Epiglottitis,Infectious mononucleosis,Retropharyngeal abscess,C,"The history is of fever with upper respiratory obstruction in a child who is unimmunised. The degree of fever, drooling and tachycardia suggests epiglottitis. Of particular note is the quiet (rather than hoarse) voice. A hoarse voice would point more towards bacterial tracheitis or croup. She requires gaseous anaesthesia, intubation by the most experienced anaesthetist available and intravenous antibiotics to cover H. influenzae type B on a paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)."
pediatrics,94,You are attending a clinic on eating disorders. What renal change is typical in people with severe malnutrition?,Increase in serum urea,Increased clearance of serum urate,Increased glomerular filtration rate,Reduced aldosterone secretion,Reduced glomerular filtration rate,E,"Patients with severe malnutrition will have a reduced glomerular filtration rate and increased aldosterone secretion causing altered excretion patterns of many renally-cleared solutes. During starvation or severe malnutrition, the body systems have to make many adaptations to reduced food intake. Changes in renal physiology include increased aldosterone secretion and a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) causing altered excretion patterns of many solutes, electrolytes and drugs. There is increased urinary excretion of potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate, causing a tendency to hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia over time. The reduced muscle bulk in people with severe malnutrition causes low levels of production of urea and creatinine, although reduced excretion causes plasma levels to be normal or only slightly reduced. As muscle is broken down to provide substrates for gluconeogenesis a negative nitrogen balance ensues. Urate excretion is reduced causing a relative hyperuricaemia."
pediatrics,95,"A 3-year-old girl is referred with incidentally-discovered heart murmur. She has had no blueness nor breathlessness. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she is apyrexial, well and well grown with no dysmorphic features. Respiratory rate is 20/min and pulse is 100/min. Heart sounds are normal. She has a 1-2/6 murmur best heard under the right clavicle, which changes with posture. The liver is impalpable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic stenosis,"Atrial septal defect, secundum",Atrioventricular canal defect,Innocent murmur,Pulmonary stenosis,D,"The history is of asymptomatic heart murmur which is soft and varies with posture. This is most likely an innocent murmur, in this case a venous hum caused by the rumble of blood through the great veins of the neck. It requires explanation and reassurance."
pediatrics,96,"A 10-month-old child presents acutely with non-blanching, purpuric skin lesions. Which of the following statements is correct?","A haemoglobin of 73 g/L, with a white cell count of 2 ×10^9/L and platelets of 86 suggests acute leukaemia","If the haemoglobin is 123 g/L, the white cell count is 12 ×10^9/L, and the platelets are 97, this suggests Henoch-Schönlein purpura",Microscopic haematuria suggests infective endocarditis,Splenomegaly suggests idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura (ITP),The likeliest cause is meningococcal disease,A,"Thrombocytopenic causes of purpura in children include:  Impaired production - leukaemia, aplastic anaemia Excessive destruction - immune (ITP), secondary (SLE, drugs, viral infections), alloimmune neonatal thrombocytopenia Consumptive coagulopathy - DIC, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura Congenital - giant haemangioma, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.  Vascular disorders are also a cause:  Congenital - connective tissues disorders (osteogenesis imperfecta, Ehler's-Danlos, Marfan's) Acquired - meningococcal and other severe infections Immune - HSP, connective tissue disorders (SLE).  Although meningococcal disease is an important differential in all children with purpura, it is not the most likely cause. Even in febrile children, only 7% will have meningococcal disease. The platelet count in Henoch-Schonlein purpura is normal. In idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura there is an absence of hepatosplenomegaly. Acute leukaemia is an important differential in anybody with pancytopenia. Microscopic haematuria plus purpura may occur in infective endocarditis, but may also be related to HSP or SLE. "
pediatrics,97,"A boisterous 15-month-old girl presents with a painful elbow. She was reluctant to come with mother, who pulled her up by the arm with sudden onset of pain. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.5°C, respiratory rate 25/min and pulse 100/min. The left arm is dangling with forearm pronated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Condylar fracture,Epicondylar fracture,Physial fracture,Radial head dislocation,Supracondylar fracture,D,"The mechanism of injury and clinical findings point to a pulled (nursemaid's) elbow (subluxed annular ligament of radius). This can be restored by supinating the elbow and pushing backwards whilst holding the elbow. A click is usually felt with full immediate relief of symptoms. Fracture of the elbow include:  supracondylar condylar epicondylar physial (growth plate), and fracture dislocation.  "
pediatrics,98,"A 15-month-old boy presents with high fever of six days duration, rash, tender neck glands, red eyes and cracked lips. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There was no FH/SH of note. On examination:    Temperature 38.9°C   Respiratory rate 30/min   Heart rate 120/min    The rash is maculopapular erythematous and blanching. The hands and feet are swollen. He has tender cervical gland enlargement, non-purulent conjunctivitis and prominent tongue papillae. He is miserable and clingy. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Kawasaki disease,Measles,Rubella,Scarlet fever,Toxic shock syndrome,A,"The history is classical of Kawasaki disease (muco-cutaneous lymphnode syndrome). The features described fulfil the international criteria, the diagnosis being purely clinical. Often there is elevation of C reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and platelet count. IVIG 2 g/kg should be given within the first 10 days of illness to reduce the risk of coronary artery aneurysm."
pediatrics,99,Which of the following statements regarding hiccup is true?,Can reliably be treated with theophylline,Is caused by a tonic relaxation of the diaphragm,Is commonly caused by local irritation to the vagus nerve,May be caused by a foreign body in the nose,May be caused by a posterior fossa tumour,E,"Hiccup is caused by frequent or rhythmic clonic contraction of the diaphragm. When prolonged, other causes should be considered including:  CNS disease - posterior fossa tumour, brain injury, encephalitis Phrenic nerve or diaphragm irritation - tumour, pleurisy, pneumonia, intrathoracic adenopathy, pericarditis, gastro-oesophageal reflux, oesophagitis  Systemic causes include alcohol intoxication and uraemia. Other causes include foreign body or insect in the ear. In infants it may be associated with apnoea or hyperventilation. Folk remedies include aerophagia, breath holding, pharyngeal stimulation, distraction. Haloperidol, metaclopramide and several anaesthetic agents are also said to work. "
pediatrics,100,A male infant is brought to clinic with a short history of vomiting and diarrhoea. Which of the following is most applicable concerning this infant?,Bloody diarrhoea would be expected with Staph. aureus food poisoning,He should be treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic,"If dehydrated, he is likely to be hyponatraemic",In hyponatraemia is associated with 'doughy' skin turgor,Stool culture is not indicated,E,"Antibiotics are of little value as the condition is commonly caused by viruses. Haemorrhagic colitis may develop following Escherichia coli O157:H7 infections but Staph. aureus enterotoxin would not be expected to cause bloody diarrhoea. The commonest cause is rotavirus. Stool culture is indicated in the following situations as per NICE guidelines:  suspected septicaemia, blood or mucous in stool immunocomprimised child recent travel symptoms not improved after 7 days, or uncertainty about the diagnosis.  If severely dehydrated hypernatraemia may also develop if there has been disproportionate water loss. Clinical signs of dehydration are generally mild unless body weight has reduced by more than 5%, but they are not always present either, hence history is important. "
pediatrics,101,"You are asked to attend the delivery of a term neonate with an antenatal history of bilateral hydronephrosis and oligohydramnios. He is in a good condition at birth, does not require resuscitation, and is transferred to the postnatal ward. On examination he weighs 3.1 kg. He looks well and there are no abnormal findings on routine baby check. He does not have a palpable bladder and you observe him passing urine. How will you manage him?","Discharge, no follow-up required",Discharge with routine paediatric urology follow-up,"Discharge, but with an ultrasound scan of his renal tract and serum Uandamp;E within 1 week followed by a review in clinic","Keep in hospital, organise an ultrasound of his renal tract and Uandamp;E, no need to catheterise as he can pass urine normally","Pass a urethral catheter, request an ultrasound of his renal tract and serum Uandamp;E, and contact the paediatric urology team",E,"Posterior urethral valves (PUVs) are a congenital obstruction of the urethra. They commonly give rise to secondary changes to the bladder and kidneys, with significant deleterious effects. Young has classified them into three types:  Two separate, side-by-side valve leaflets arising from the verumontanum and extending through the region of the external urethral sphincter to attach to the anterior urethral wall (95% cases) Leaflets that extend upwards from the verumontanum - they are non-obstructive folds of mucosa with no clinical significance (rare) Transverse membrane in the bulbar urethra with no attachment to the verumontanum (5% cases).  The mortality rate was near 100% in the early 20th century. In a recent study it was documented at 0.3%, but at the expense of an increased rate of children with chronic renal failure. 80% are detected on antenatal ultrasound. VUR is present in 40-60% of cases at the time of diagnosis; it is unilateral in two-thirds of cases. Pulmonary hypoplasia can be associated, and hence requires consideration and appropriate early and ongoing management. The neonate should be assessed for a palpable bladder and micturition observed and documented. A urethral catheter or feeding tube should be passed (typically 6-8F), fixed in position, and urine output accurately measured and recorded. If the catheter becomes dislodged it should be promptly replaced. Even if the neonate does not have a palpable bladder and is seen to pass some urine, they may still have PUVs and could deteriorate further without adequate bladder drainage. The patient should be discussed with a paediatric urologist. An ultrasound scan of the renal tract and micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) should be organised within the first week of life. Treatment dose trimethoprim should be given one day before the MCUG, on the day of the investigation, and three days following. Serum Uandamp;E should be measured after 48 hours and repeated as regularly as necessary according to the degree of renal impairment. Note: before 48 hours the serum creatinine is a reflection of the maternal renal function. If PUVs are confirmed the neonate will undergo a cystoscopy and ablation of posterior urethral valves once the creatinine has stabilised and the neonate is fit enough for the general anaesthetic. There is no rush if the bladder is being drained by an appropriately sized catheter. "
pediatrics,102,"A 15-year-old girl is brought into the Emergency department. She has been feeling tired and weak and has been experiencing symptoms of loss of appetite, vomiting and abdominal pain. She has been previously well, but is now found to be hypoglycaemic with low sodium but high potassium. What is the underlying diagnosis for these symptoms?",Addison's disease,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Cushing syndrome,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Space occupying lesion,A,"Chronic adrenal insufficiency can present with:  fatigue weakness anorexia nausea vomiting, and abdominal pain.  All these features are very similar to diabetic ketoacidosis. Some individuals will also have postural hypotension, pigmentation of palmar crease and buccal mucosa. Biochemically there will be low sodium, low blood glucose and a high potassium level. Although Addison's disease and congenital adrenal hyperplasia would give a similar picture, given the girl is now 15 and had been previously well Addison's disease is the underlying diagnosis."
pediatrics,103,Which one of the following statements is correct concerning hyperglycaemia (non-ketotic) in an established diabetic child :,Is a cause of recurrent urinary tract infections,Is usually symptomatic,May be seen following an untreated hypoglycaemic convulsion,Requires additional insulin immediately,Should be treated by reducing the number of daily carbohydrate exchanges,C,"Non-ketotic hyperglycaemia is usually asymptomatic, or less frequently mild symptoms such as thirst and polyuria may develop. Additional 'stat' doses of insulin may cause hypoglycaemia later. Untreated hypoglycaemia may result in delayed hyperglycaemia through the influence of counter-regulatory hormones, for example, catecholamines and growth hormone, which will raise blood glucose (Somogyi effect). Recurrent urinary infections are not associated, however furuncles are. The condition should be treated according to the cause. For example, if the hyperglycaemia is reactive and preceded by severe hypoglycaemia, insulin dosage may have to be reduced and carbohydrates increased."
pediatrics,104,"A 2-month-old girl is brought to the dermatology clinic with bullous lesions. Her parents are told that she has a condition that is inherited. When reading about the condition they find that all daughters of an affected male will be affected, and males are more severely affected than females, so that there are usually an excess of females with the disease in question, even if it is not lethal in males. The geneticist also explains that no male-to-male transmission can occur. Which skin condition is being described?",Epidermolysis bullosa simplex,Ichthyosis vulgaris,Incontinentia pigmenti,Langerhans cell histiocytosis,Tuberous sclerosis,C,"Incontinentia pigmenti is an X linked dominant skin condition. It affects the skin, hair, teeth, nails and central nervous system. The skin lesions evolve through characteristic stages: blistering (from birth to about 4 months of age), a wart-like rash (for several months), macular hyperpigmentation, linear hypopigmentation. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is incorrect it is not an inherited disease. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex, ichthyosis vulgaris and tuberous sclerosis are incorrect because they are all autosomal dominant skin conditions. In X linked dominant inheritance the gene responsible for the condition is located on the X chromosome. Unlike X linked recessive conditions which require two doses, when an X linked gene is said to express dominant inheritance, it means that a single dose of the mutant allele will affect the phenotype of the female. X linked dominant conditions are very rare. Examples include:  Aicardi syndrome (lethal in affected males) Vitamin D resistant hypophosphataemic rickets X linked hereditary and sensory motor neuropathy type 1 Incontenia pigmenti Rett syndrome."
pediatrics,105,"A 7-year-old girl presents with a two week history of fever and leg pain. This has disturbed sleep and has not responded to paracetamol. She seems restless and uncomfortable, but alert and cooperative. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations up to date. There was no FH/SH of note. On examination:    Temperature 38.2°C   Respiratory rate 15/min   Heart rate 90/min    Chest and ENT examination are normal. Abdomen contains a large mass extending across the midline. She has tenderness locally on palpation of the thigh. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Neuroblastoma,Osteoblastoma,Osteomyelitis,Reactive arthitis,Septic arthritis,A,"The history of fever, large abdominal mass and focal bony tenderness suggest a malignancy with bony secondaries. In this case neuroblastoma seems most likely. Chromosome 1p deletion or MYCN amplification have a very poor prognosis.   "
pediatrics,106,Which of the following investigations is most likely to detect the earliest changes of Perthes' disease?,CT,MRI,Nuclear scan,Plain x ray,Ultrasound,B,"Legg-Calvé-Perthes' disease is the name given to idiopathic osteonecrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis of the femoral head. Plain x rays of the hip are extremely useful in establishing the diagnosis. MRI and contrast MRI in the early stages, will give far more detail of necrosis, revascularisation and healing than plain x rays. A nuclear scan will provide less detail and exposes the child to radiation although a technetium 99 bone scan is helpful in delineating the extent of avascular changes before they are evident on plain radiographs. "
pediatrics,107,"A 4-year-old girl presents with a history of a low grade fever fever and sore throat. She has had a coryzal illness for two days, but over the past 24 hours has had painful swallowing. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. Her elder brother has recently had a cold. On examination she has a fever of 38.5°C, with respiratory rate of 16/min and heart rate of 100/min. She is alert and well perfused. She has a crusty nose and her throat is red, but there is no exudate on the tonsils. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial tracheitis,Epiglottitis,Group A streptococcal infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Respiratory viral infection,E,"The history of family contact, preceding coryza, the low-grade fever, and age less than five years with absence of palatal petechiae point to a viral infection rather than group A streptococcal infection. Reliable distinction is impossible clinically, however. Usually this will burn itself out within five days, and treatment is with simple analgesia."
pediatrics,108,A 18-year-old male presents with blurring of vision in his right eye. Examination reveals visual acuity in the right eye of 6/18 and in the left eye 6/6. Visual fields to confrontation reveal a right temporal visual field defect and partial loss of superior part of the temporal field of the left eye. Where is the most likely position of the lesion responsible for this defect?,Occipital lobe,Optic chiasm,Optic nerve,Optic tract,Temporal lobe,B,The most likely localisation of the lesion is around the optic chiasm spreading up the right optic nerve. The signs indicate a bitemporal visual field defect with involvement of the right optic nerve (decreased visual acuity). Occipital lobe lesion causes a congruous homonymous hemianopia whereas an optic tract lesion causes an incongruous homonymous hemianopia. Temporal lobe lesion causes an upper homonymous quantranopia. Optic nerve lesions in isolation lead to unilateral visual signs. 
pediatrics,109,Which of the following suggests a diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum rather than chickenpox?,Absence of erythema surrounding lesions,Lesions disappearing within a month,Positive contact history,Presence of macules and papules,Presence of pruritus,A,"Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) pox virus. The lesions are small, skin coloured papules with central umbilication. There is little surrounding inflammation and they may be spread following scratching to other sites. Chickenpox lesions in the early stages may be mistaken for molluscum. However, the presence of associated macules and later vesicles and pustules help to differentiate them. These lesions also affect the mucus membranes, and usually disappear within a few weeks, while molluscum can persist for up to a year. "
pediatrics,110,"A 12-year-old girl attends the clinic for symptoms of a urinary tract infection, including dysuria and suprapubic pain. MCS is requested on a sample and the infection is found to be sensitive to trimethoprim. Which of the following most accurately reflects the mode of action of trimethoprim?",Inhibits cell wall synthesis,Inhibits DNA gyrase,Inhibits folic acid metabolism,Inhibits protein synthesis,Inhibits RNA polymerase,C,"The answer is it inhibits folic acid metabolism. Both trimethoprim and sulphonamides block bacterial folic acid metabolism. Folic acid metabolism is essential for driving bacterial growth. Inhibitors of cell wall synthesis include  Penicillins Cephalosporins and Vancomycin.   Additionally  The quinolones are inhibitors of DNA gyrase Rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase  A number of antibiotics including macrolides, tetracyclines, clindamycin and gentamicin inhibit bacterial protein synthesis."
pediatrics,111,A healthy baby boy is born at term to a woman who was unwell with confirmed acute hepatitis B during pregnancy. The mother is very concerned that she may have infected the baby with hepatitis B. What SINGLE preventative intervention should be given to the baby?,Full course of hepatitis B vaccine,Hepatitis B immunoglobulin alone,Hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immunoglobulin,Hepatitis B vaccine as single dose,None until hepatitis B status confirmed,C,"Babies born to mothers infected with hepatitis B have a high risk of acquiring infection, which can be prevented by vaccination at birth. All babies with seropositive mothers should have the full primary course of hepatitis B immunisation and should also have HBIG within 24 hours of birth"
pediatrics,112,"A 6-year-old girl presents with fever and coryza. The nurse has also found 2+ proteinuria on dipstix testing. She has previously been well. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a temperature of 38.9°C, with crusty nasal discharge and slight cough. Respiratory rate is 15/min, pulse 85/min and lung fields are clear. Her fever settles after 48 hours and the proteinuria disappears at the same time. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glomerulonephritis,Nephrotic syndrome,Orthostatic proteinuria,Transient proteinuria (benign),Urinary tract infection,D,"The picture is one of transient proteinuria in association with a mild febrile illness. Up to 2+ proteinuria can occur with fever for unknown reasons. It is considered benign when it disappears completely, as in this case."
pediatrics,113,You are considering prescribing salmeterol in combination with inhaled steroids for a 12-year-old boy who has asthma. Which of the following correctly describes the mode of action of salmeterol?,Complete beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist,Complete beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist,Partial beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist,Partial beta-2 adrenoceptor antagonist,Partial beta-1 adrenoceptor agonist,C,The answer is partial beta-2 adrenoceptor agonist. Salmeterol is a partial agonist at the beta-2 adrenoreceptor. It has less activity than salbutamol with respect to bronchodilatation but a much longer duration of action which means it can be given twice a day. Salbutamol is considered a complete beta-2 agonist and is valuable as a relieving agent in the treatment of acute asthma. Beta-1 antagonists are used in the treatment of blood pressure by reducing both heart rate and myocardial contractility. The first generation of beta blocking agents were non-selective beta antagonists affecting both the beta-1 and beta-2 receptor.
pediatrics,114,A 6-weeks-old baby has a blue mark near coccyx since birth. His mother is worried. What would you do?,Reassure,Coag profile,Karyotyping,Skeletal survey,CT,A,This is a benign condition known as “Mongolian spot” or “Mongolian blue”. Mongolian spot refers to a macular blue-gray pigmentation usually on the sacral area of healthy infants. Mongolian spot is usually present at birth or appears within the first weeks of life. Mongolian spot typically disappears spontaneously within 4 years but can persist for life
pediatrics,115,A stiff neck is not present in which of the following conditions in a young child?,Acute poliomyelitis,Gianotti Crosti syndrome,Retropharyngeal abscess,Still's disease,Tuberculosis,B,"Gianotti-Crosti syndorme is a rare childhood skin condition characterized by a papular rash with blisters on the skin of the legs, buttocks, and arms; systemic involvement is rare. The involvement of the cervical spine in the arthritis of Still's disease may cause neck stiffness. TB may cause tuberculous meningitis, or Pott's disease, both of which may cause neck stiffness. Retropharyngeal abscess is a recognised cause of neck stiffness with an extended neck. An aseptic meningitis can occur with acute poliomyelitis."
pediatrics,116,Which of the following mechanisms is known to cause Prader-Willi syndrome?,Autosomal monosomy,Autosomal trisomy,Chromosome duplication,Translocation,Uniparental disomy,E,"Prader-Willi syndrome is effected by genomic imprinting. Thus, a uniparental disomy could cause the disease."
pediatrics,117,"An 8-year-old boy is said by his parents to have a difficult temperament for many years now, so much so that is disrupting the rest of the family's life. He will often be aggressive, rude and swears a lot. He has learning and reading difficulties and is hyperactive. What is the likely diagnosis?",Attention deficit hyperactive disorder,Behavioural problems,Conduct disorder,Poor parenting,Tantrums,C,"Many children will have tantrums when they are younger, however, the scenario suggests that this child has significant behavioural problems and not simply tantrums. There may be poor parental issues but again this is not likely to be the main bulk of the situation. Behavioural problems usually constitute being rude, swearing, not doing as they were asked and being physically violent. When this has been a regular occurrence for a prolonged period of time, is in the state that it disrupts the family and is leading to developmental difficulties the child is said to have conduct disorder. There are not enough features to diagnose ADHD (hyperactivity, inattention and impulsiveness)."
pediatrics,118,"A 2-year-old boy presents with fever and cloudy urine, which is painful to pass. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination his temperature is 37.8°C, respiratory rate 15/min and heart rate is 100/min. He is alert and well perfused. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Urine dipstick testing shows +protein, 2+blood. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benign familial haematuria,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Haemorrhagic cystitis,Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,Urinary tract infection,E,"The fever and discoloured urine suggest a UTI. This impression is strengthened by the urine dipstick findings. At least two urine samples should be taken if possible by clean catch or catheter prior to commencing antibiotics. If the fever fails to settle within 48 hours or if there are recurrent episodes, then investigations should include at least ultrasound scan of the kidneys, ureter, and bladder (KUB). If there are abnormalities on this scan, then further investigations may be required. "
pediatrics,119,"A 1-day-old infant is brought to the Emergency department cyanosed and breathless. He was born at term by normal vaginal delivery to non-consanguineous parents following an uncomplicated pregnancy. On arrival he is floppy and deeply cyanosed. Heart rate 180 beats per minute, respiratory rate 70 breaths per minute, central capillary refill time 6 seconds. On examination he has dual heart sounds with no murmurs. Both femoral pulses are palpable. The chest x ray shows increased pulmonary vascular markings and the cardiac shadow has an 'egg on side' appearance. Which is the single most likely diagnosis?",Coarctation of the aorta,Hypoplastic left heart,Pulmonary atresia,Tetralogy of Fallot,Transposition great arteries,E,"Tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia and transposition of the great arteries are all cyanotic heart lesions. Co-arctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome do not result in cyanosis. Transposition of the great arteries is a duct dependant lesion and typically presents with neonatal collapse and cyanosis in the first week of life as the duct closes. There is no heart murmur and the chest x ray has an 'egg-on-side' appearance with cardiomegaly, a narrow mediastinum and pulmonary plethora. In tetraology of Fallot, cyanosis usually develops with time due to progressive right ventricular outflow tract obstruction and is rarely present at birth. An ejection systolic murmur at the upper left sternal edge is typical and the chest x ray has a characteristic 'boot-shaped heart' appearance. Ductal tissue encircling the aorta can cause co-arctation and obstruction as the duct closes and may present with weak or absent femoral pulses and signs of heart failure in the first week of life. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome is also an obstructive lesion with weak or absent femoral pulses, and is duct dependant."
pediatrics,120,"A previously well 13-year-old girl presents to her GP as her teachers are concerned that she is not able to concentrate at school. She also reports finding it difficult to get to sleep although she is always tired and has aching bones. After running blood tests, she is found to have an abnormal calcium level. Which of these conditions is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?",Cushing's syndrome,DiGeorge syndrome,MEN syndrome,Prader-Willi syndrome,Turner syndrome,C,"The symptoms of hypercalcaemia can be remembered using the mnemonic 'stones, bones, moans and groans'. Primary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid malignancy account for 90% of causes of hypercalcaemia. In children this often results from MEN syndrome. This is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. MEN 1 and MEN 2A are associated with hyperparathyroid hyperplasia. Cushing's syndrome and DiGeorge syndrome are both incorrect as these syndromes are associated with hypocalcaemia. Hypocalcaemia symptoms include paraethesia and tetany, and do not fit with the case described. Prader-Willi syndrome and Turner syndrome are incorrect as neither classically cause disturbance of calcium levels."
pediatrics,121,"A 17-year-old pregnant female attends antenatal clinic and is noted to have scattered small, raised lesions on her trunk and axillary freckles. She was not aware of any of her family members having these lesions. What is the likely mode of inheritance of this condition?",Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Trinucleotide repeating,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,A,This patient has neurofibromatosis with axillary freckling and neurofibromas. This is usually inherited as autosomal dominant although it may arise from a sporadic new mutation of the NF1 gene.
pediatrics,122,Which one of the following is a reliable method of assessing dehydration in a 3-month-old infant?,Assessment of intra-ocular tension by palpation,Blood pressure,Palpation of the anterior fontanelle,Serum sodium concentration,Skin turgor over the dorsum of the hand,C,"Signs of dehydration are not very reliable in the infant and always lag behind symptoms. Palpation of the anterior fontanelle is the most useful of the signs mentioned here. Thirst and oliguria may occur if the child is greater than5% dehydrated. Tachycardia and low blood pressure only occur in severe cases of greater than10% dehydration. Skin turgor is unreliable in overweight infants. Serum sodium may be entirely normal, or it may be low if there is electrolyte loss in the stool. However raised serum sodium can be seen when water loss is in excess of electrolytes."
pediatrics,123,Which of the following is a X-linked recessive condition?,Achondroplasia,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Cystic fibrosis,Klinefelter's disease,Red-Green Colour Blindness,E,"X-linked recessive conditions include:  Haemophilia A and B Duchenne Muscular dystrophy, and colour blindness.  Achondroplasia is autosomal dominant. Cystic fibrosis and congenital adrenal hyperplasia are Autosomal recessive. Klinefelter's is a consequence of XXY karyotype and has no pattern of inheritance."

What is the diagnosis?",Pyloric stenosis,Duodenal atresia,Hirschsprung disease,Achalasia cardia,Tracheo-esophageal fistula,A,"why not duodenal atresia? Pyloric stenosis is much commoner than duodenal atresia; in duodenal atresia the vomitus should contain bile, which is not the case in pyloric stenosis"
pediatrics,125,A 5-year-old girl is referred by her GP concerning a cardiac murmur detected during examination for recurrent pneumonia. Her mother explains the girl is very behind at school and has been referred for speech therapy. You note the girl's mother had a cleft lip repair and that she and her daughter share slightly unusual facial features. What is the most likely underlying condition?,DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion),Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD),Fragile X syndrome (FRAXA),Stickler syndrome (COL2A1/COL11A1 mutations),Williams syndrome (7q11.23 deletion),A,"The history suggests a genetic condition with facial characteristics, cardiac abnormality, immunity concerns, learning difficulties, and speech problems. These are all aspects of DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion). DiGeorge syndrome is an autosomal dominant microdeletion syndrome associated with:  characteristic facial features cardiac defects oropharyngeal abnormalities genitourinary problems endocrine and immune system dysfunction brain abnormalities developmental problems, and psychiatric disorders.  Although most affected children are detected at or before birth, 22q11 deletion has a very wide clinical spectrum of severity. Mildly affected parents may be unaware of their own genetic condition and should be investigated if 22q11 microdeletion is detected in their offspring. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is not an inherited condition and it would be highly unlikely that both mother and daughter would share FASD characteristics. Fragile X syndrome in females is not a usual cause of oropharyngeal abnormalities, cardiac disorders, or low immunity. Stickler syndrome is an autosomal dominant collagen gene mutation. Key characteristics are eye abnormalities (95% of cases), joint issues, and hearing loss, which are not seen in this scenario. Although Williams syndrome is associated with characteristic facies, developmental problems, and cardiac and renal anomalies, few patients with Williams syndrome go on to have children, and cleft lip or palate is not a feature."
pediatrics,126,"You are called to the delivery of a 41+4 gestation infant who is being delivered by emergency caesarian section. Mother is a healthy Caucasian of 27 years, who smokes 15/d. There have been concerns about fetal growth on serial ultrasound scans. Labour commenced 18 hours ago, and mother has been in Stage 2 for the past 90 minutes. There have been three bradycardias with delayed recovery, and the liquor is thickly meconium stained. The baby is given to you. She is floppy, pale and covered in thick meconium. What should you do next?",Check whether there are other risk factors for IUGR,Give inflation breaths with high flow oxygen,Give surfactant as soon as possible,Inspect the oropharynx and suction any obvious meconium,Tracheal intubation immediately,D,"Attempts to aspirate meconium from the nose and mouth of the unborn infant, while the head is still on the perineum, are not recommended. The emphasis should be on initiating lung inflation within the first minute of life in non-breathing or ineffectively breathing infants and this should not be delayed. If presented with a floppy, apnoeic infant born through thick particulate meconium it is reasonable to inspect the oropharynx rapidly to remove potential obstructions. Tracheal intubation should not be routine in the presence of meconium and should only be performed for suspected tracheal obstruction."
pediatrics,127,"A couple bring their 7-year-old daughter to clinic as they are concerned about her development. She has a history of delayed speech, ataxia with a broad based gait and also has been diagnosed with epilepsy. She has a strange affect characterised by inappropriate laughter. Her karyotype is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Alice in Wonderland syndrome,Angelman syndrome,Asperger's syndrome,Prader-Willi syndrome,Turner's syndrome,B,"Angelman syndrome is caused by a deletion of q12 in the maternal copy of chromosome 15. A similar deletion in the paternal copy of chromosome 15 causes Prader-Willi syndrome (mental retardation and hyperphagia). Asperger's syndrome is characterised by severe and sustained impairment in social interaction, development of restricted and repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests, and activities. The 'happy' behaviour is not a feature. "
pediatrics,128,A 12-month-old boy presents with rash and high fever. A diagnosis of measles is suspected. Which one of the following statements is true concerning measles infection?,Erythromycin may shorten the duration of illness,Immunisation should have been provided at the age of 6 months,Koplik spots are pathognomonic,The erythematous maculo-papular rash usually starts on the hands,Use of prophylactic antibiotics can prevent secondary bacterial infection,C,"Prophylactic antibiotics are of no proven benefit in measles infection. Koplik spots are specific to measles infection. Erthyromycin does not shorten the duration of measles. Immunisation is given at around 12-15 months with the MMR vaccine. The erythematous rash in measles is widespread and not to be confused with the vesicular eruption of chicken pox, which is centripetal. "

On examination, lethargy is noted, but no obvious clinical finding is identified.  You decide to admit the girl and do a septic screen. Blood results show normal renal function. She is diagnosed with an E-Coli UTI and commenced on antibiotics. She has shown good improvement within 48 hours and now she is ready for discharge. What is the next step in the management plan?",Order a DMSA,Perform an urgent ultrasound,Prescribe prophylactic antibiotics until MCUG is done,Ultrasound within six weeks,Urgent MCUG,D,"UTIs in children are usually simple, but in some situations, they might be atypical or recurrent which may lead to renal scarring or even renal failure. Therefore, NICE has developed a comprehensive guideline for the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of UTIs. In this case, the normal renal function, E-coli UTI, good response within 48 hours and lack of any clinical features to suggest septicaemia should suggest that the UTI is a simple one.

pediatrics,132,"A 12-year-old boy presents with a deformed right ankle, resulting from a rough tackle whilst playing football. The radiograph shows a Salter-Harris type III fracture of the right medial malleolus. Which of the following is correct regarding the Salter-Harris classification for bone injuries in children?",Accounts for less than5% of all fractures in children,Growth arrest is common in Salter-Harris type I injury,"In Salter-Harris type V, there is compression of the physis leading to growth arrest",Salter-Harris type IV is the commonest form of growth plate injury,This classification is for fractures through the metaphysis and the diaphysis,C,"This classification is for fractures through the growth plate or the epiphysis (in Salter-Harris types II and IV the metaphyseal fragment is also involved but the diaphysis is never affected). Salter-Harris types I and II do not involve the germinal layer and therefore growth disturbance is uncommon. Salter-Harris types II and I are the commonest forms of epiphyseal injuries. In Salter-Harris types III and IV the germinal layer is breached and growth disturbance is likely, although its incidence could be minimised by precise reduction of the fracture. Although not originally described, Salter-Harris type V fracture is recognised as a crushing injury of the physis (growth plate) following which growth arrest is common. This fracture is often diagnosed retrospectively, when disturbance of physeal growth is apparent as a limb deformity. It is rare (less than 1%) but has the worst prognosis. Because of the weakness of the growth plate these injuries are relatively common accounting for approximately one-third of all fractures in children."
pediatrics,133,A 17-year-old male student attends clinic complaining of right knee pain and left ankle pain. These pains have deteriorated over the last two months and are associated with episodic diarrhoea. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Amoebic dysentery,Chronic appendicitis,Coeliac disease,Ulcerative colitis,Whipple's disease,D,This patient has oligoarthropathy associated with episodic diarrhoea which suggests a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease.
pediatrics,134,"A 10-month-old boy presents with a three month history of diarrhoea. He was well until 6 months of age, when he developed vomiting and diarrhoea. The vomiting settled within 24 hours, but the diarrhoea has persisted three to four times a day, loose and watery. He has become thinner. He was born at term weighing 3.45 kg, is fully immunised, and there is no FH/SH of note. On examination he looks thin and wasted, with loose buttock skin folds. He is below the 3% for weight and on the 25% for height. He looks pale but is not clubbed. Cardiac and respiratory examination is normal. His abdomen is distended and tympanic and he has perianal excoriation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune enteropathy,Coeliac disease,Post-enteritis enteropathy,Toddler diarrhoea,Ulcerative colitis,C,"The history suggests acute gastroenteritis, followed by malabsorption with acidic stools causing perianal excoriation. The likely diagnosis is post-enteritis enteropathy (post-infectious secondary lactase deficiency). In this condition there is delayed recovery of the intestinal villi. Since only mature enterocytes are fully competent to digest food, this results in diarrhoea due to maldigestion. Stools may contain excess carbohydrate (more than 2+ on Clinitest) and pH less than 5.6.   (c) "

HSP is an inflammatory disorder of unknown cause characterised by IgA-dominant immune complexes in smaller venules, capillaries and arterioles. It presents with purpura, arthritis (especially ankles and knees), abdominal pains, haematuria and proteinuria. HSP is often associated with infectious agents such as group A Streptococci and Mycoplasma. If there is progression to renal impairment then renal histopathology may include minimal change to severe glomerulonephritis that is indistinguishable from IgA nephropathy. However, mesangial IgA deposits are the most typical features of HSP on renal biopsy."

Regular surgical review.",Bell's 2 - Diagnosis of NEC. For laparotomy as soon as resuscitated/stabilised.,Bell's 3 - Diagnosis of NEC. For laparotomy now; on NICU if too unstable to transfer to the operating theatre.,C,"Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is common in NICUs with a prevalence of 3-10% depending on the case mix. The pathophysiology is unclear but is thought to be multifactorial resulting from the combination of an immature gut (reduced IgA, immature villi, and poor motility), splanchnic hypoperfusion, and enteral feeding (too much too early and hyperosmolar feeds that damage the mucosa - higher risk in formula versus breast milk-fed neonates). It typically occurs in preterm neonates between 7 and 10 days of age. In term babies, it may be secondary to congenital heart disease or birth asphyxia. Bell's staging can be used to categorise patients into one of three groups:  Suspected NEC - Signs and symptoms include irritability, apnoeas, bilious aspirates, abdominal distension +/− faecal occult blood. Radiology shows intestinal distension. Definite NEC - Signs and symptoms as above, plus possible gastrointestinal bleeding +/− abdominal mass. Radiology shows pneumatosis, 'fixed loops' of bowel on serial x rays, portal venous gas. Advanced NEC - Signs and symptoms as above + shock +/− marked GI bleeding. No improvement or deterioration with conservative management. Radiology shows pneumoperitoneum, severe ascites.  Bell's stage 1 and 2 are generally managed conservatively with resuscitation, IV antibiotics, NBM, IVF, or TPN. If improving then continue conservative management for 7-10 days before recommencing enteral feeding. If Bell's 3 or failing to progress after 24-48 hours then surgical intervention is required; this most commonly involves a laparotomy and proceed. Indications for surgery include:  Pneumoperitoneum - indicative of perforation Failure to improve after 24-48 hours of conservative management Obstructive features - increasing distension and bilious aspirates Fixed loop' on serial imaging suggesting a mass Increasing abdominal wall erythema, and Palpable abdominal mass.

pediatrics,138,"Compared with bottle feeding, breast feeding is relatively protective against which of the following?",Late haemorrhagic disease of the newborn,Type 2 diabetes,Maternal breast cancer,Prolonged jaundice,Under-feeding,C,"Breast fed infants have a reduced risk of infection, though the effect is less in industrialised societies. The protective effect is increased for low birth weight infants. There may also be:  improved cognitive and psychological development reduced risk of juvenile onset diabetes, and reduced risk of maternal breast cancer.  Disadvantages of breast feeding include:  social limitations - unfortunately, there are still social situations where breast feeding is not sufficiently supported under-feeding: if breast feeding is not established, then the child may be admitted with excessive weight loss at a few days of age late haemorrhagic disease of the newborn breast milk jaundice: this may result in investigations for prolonged jaundice  "
pediatrics,139,A 12-year-old girl presents with anxiety and weight loss. She is noted to have a fine tremor and a pulse of 100 beats per minute. Thyroid function tests confirm thyrotoxicosis. Which one of the following statements is true of thyrotoxicosis in children?,Is more common in males,Is often associated with short stature,Is treated in the first instance with anti-thyroid drugs such as carbimazole,Is usually associated with a high TSH level,Is usually not due to an auto-immune process,C,"Thyrotoxicosis has a female preponderance in all age groups. Thyrotoxicosis in early life may cause delayed sexual maturation, although physical development is normal and skeletal growth may be accelerated. Thyrotoxicosis in this age group is mostly due to Graves' disease. Anti thyroid drugs, are used initially and relapses can be treated with drugs or surgery. Radioactive iodine is generally not administered. TSH is suppressed."
pediatrics,140,A 14-year-old Bangladeshi boy presents with a history of cough and fever of two months duration. Recently he has begun to produce rusty brown sputum and has been hot and sweaty at night in bed. On examination he is on the 50th centile for height and the third centile for weight. He has a respiratory rate of 20/minute with mild recession. He is dull to percussion at the right base with poor air entry there. He has a patch of bronchial breathing at the right mid-zone posteriorly. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Allergic rhinitis,Asthma,Mycoplasma pneumonia,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Tuberculosis,E,"The history is one suggestive of a chronic chest infection with pleural effusion and weight loss. The night sweats and ethnicity make tuberculosis the prime suspect. Treatment requires prolonged therapy, and this is best given as directly observed therapy (DOT) three times a week. The medications are unpleasant, and partial treatment encourages the development of resistant organisms."
pediatrics,141,A 2-month-old baby is admitted with seizures and failure to thrive. Following a seizure he is found to have a blood glucose concentration of 1.2 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). Other biochemistry reveals a lactic acidosis and hyperlipidaemia. Examination reveals hepatomegaly with palpable kidneys. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Gaucher's disease,McArdle's disease,Niemann-Pick disease,Pompe disease,Von Gierke disease,E,"This baby has hypoglycaemia accounting for fits, associated with lactic acidosis and hepatomegaly which would point to a diagnosis of von Gierke's disease. This is a glycogen storage disease due to deficiency of glucose-6-phosphatase. Glycogen is stored in both liver and kidney causing enlargement. Both Gaucher's and Niemann-Pick disease are lipid storage disorders. McArdle's disease is a glycogen storage disease affecting muscle rather than liver as is Pompe's disease. Neither would be expected to produce profound hypoglycaemia."
pediatrics,142,A 10-month-old boy is brought to clinic. His parents are concerned after he came into contact with another child with mumps two days previously. What is the most appropriate strategy for this child?,Do nothing now but give MMR at the appropriate age,He should have his mumps serology assessed now,He should receive MMR plus mumps immunoglobulin now,He should receive mumps immunoglobulin now,He should receive the MMR now,A,"There is little that can be done as the development of immunity following mumps vaccination is too slow to be of any value. Thus, he should receive the appropriate vaccination strategy as usual."
pediatrics,143,"A 6-month-old girl presents with unresponsiveness. She had a slight cold the night before, but when mother went to wake her this morning she was drowsy and lethargic. She also had a purple rash over her arms. She was born at 36+4/40 3.1 kg and there were no neonatal complications. She had been thriving.

pediatrics,144, A 10-year-old boy presents with these lesions since birth. His father and older brother have similar lesions. What is the inheritance pattern of this condition?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Sporadic,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,A,"The patient has neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), caused by a mutation in the NF1 gene. The condition is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. However, many cases present as a new mutation.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Bronchiolitis,"Pneumonia, bacterial","Pneumonia, viral",Virus-induced wheeze,B,"The picture is of initial upper respiratory tract infection progressing to severe lower respiratory tract symptoms and signs. In this age group this is typical of bronchiolitis. Most cases are caused by Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and there are epidemics each winter. Severity is related to baby and maternal factors. Baby factors include:  chronic lung disease congenital heart disease immunodeficiency, and gastro-oesophageal reflux.  Maternal factors include:  smoking, and bottle feeding.  Breast feeding is partly protective. A modest fever to this level is not unusual. Treatment is supportive with O2 and NG or IV fluids. Occasionally ventilation may be required. "
pediatrics,147,An antihypertensive used for the management of blood pressure in adults is currently dosed twice per day. There are hints that differences in its metabolism between adults and children may allow you to dose it once per day in the paediatric population. Which of the following pharmacokinetic parameters are you most interested in when considering whether the drug is suitable for once a day dosing?,AUC drug concentration,C-max,Half life,T-max,Volume of distribution,C,"The answer is half life. Half life is the time taken for the peak concentration of an administered agent to fall by 50%. It is clear therefore that a drug with a half life of only one to two hours is highly unlikely to be suitable for daily dosing, whereas one which has a half life of 14 hours, allowing for achieving steady state concentration would be eminently suitable. C-max is the maximal plasma concentration which a drug reaches, and T-max is the time taken to reach that concentration. Both these factors may be important in determining when dose dependent adverse events may occur, and if a peak concentration is required for the drug to reach therapeutic benefit, when that is likely to occur in relation to dosing.  AUC concentration is a measure of total exposure to a drug, volume of distribution is a measure of its solubility."
pediatrics,148,"A 14-year-old girl presents with a history of cough and breathlessness on exercise. She has seasonal rhinitis, and admits to having started smoking. Clinical examination is unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Asthma,Cystic fibrosis,Gastroesophageal reflux,Sinusitis,B,"A typical history of asthma in later childhood, with exercise-induced symptoms and a general deterioration on commencement of smoking."
pediatrics,149,Which of the following will yield the highest recurrence risk for Down syndrome in a family?,20-year-old father who carries a 21/14 Robertsonian translocation and has had no previous children with Down syndrome,20-year-old mother who carries a 21/14 Robertsonian translocation and has had no previous children with Down syndrome,25-year-old mother with a previous child with trisomy 21,45-year-old mother,65-year-old father,B,"A 21/14 Robertsonian translocation is one cause of Down syndrome. If this is the case then it is much more likely that the mother is the carrier i.e. has a Robertsonian translocation. A 45-year-old mother has around a 2% chance of having a baby with Down syndrome. The previous history of Down does not constitute a higher risk, as most cases are from individual nondisjunction events."
pediatrics,150,A young boy presents with fever and cough. His father was diagnosed with TB a week ago. The parents don’t want him to have a BAL under anesthesia. Which other samples can be taken for diagnosis?,Urine,Blood,CSF,Gastric washing,Sweat,D,A young boy is able to cough up sputum unless it is dry cough where suspected TB is diagnosed by broncho-alveolar-lavage (BAL). As in dry cough TB bacteria contaminate saliva and goes to stomach with swallowed contaminated saliva Gastric- washing can bring out bacteria and detected thereby. So gastric-washing is an alternative to BAL in dry cough
pediatrics,151,"On suspecting biliary atresia in a neonate with persisting jaundice, what would be the most useful single investigation?",Direct bilirubin,Hepatoportoenterostomy,Liver function tests,Radionuclide scan,Ultrasound,D,"The best outcome for infants is if surgery is carried out before 60-days-old with the treatment of choice being the Kasai procedure (hepatoportoenterostomy). However, while this is the correct treatment it is not an investigation. A radionuclide scan is the investigation of choice. It will show unimpaired hepatic uptake, but failure of excretion of the radio-labelled isotope into the duodenum. Direct bilirubin would only indicate whether the jaundice is conjugated or unconjugated. If picked up early, liver function tests will often be normal, except for showing a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Ultrasound scan may be normal so is not very useful. However, it may show the triangular cord sign."
pediatrics,152,A 14-year-old boy presents with hypertension. Which of the following statements concerning hypertension in the young is true?,Abnormalities are frequently seen on DMSA scan,Aortic coarctation is the commonest secondary cause,Headache is the usual presenting feature,It is defined as systolic blood pressure above the 99^th centile for age,Sodium nitroprusside is useful for the long-term treatment of severe cases,A,"Sodium nitroprusside is useful only in the short term, as cyanide levels accumulate with time. Hypertension is usually diagnosed incidentally, and is defined as systolic blood pressure greater than the 95^th centile for age. Secondary causes are usually due to renal abnormalities, with reflux-associated scarring being the commonest renal disease. This will cause abnormalities on dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan. Coarctation of the aorta is the commonest non-renal cause, with pheochromocytoma/neuroblastoma, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome and steroid therapy being rarer causes. "
pediatrics,153,A 16-year-old pregnant female is seen in the emergency department with a four hour paracetamol level in the toxic levels. What is your next step in management of this case?,Avoid N-acetyl-cysteine as it does not prevent hepatoxicity in the fetus,Avoid N-acetyl cysteine as it is teratogenic,Proceed with gastric emptying,Use activated charcoal alone,Use the same dose and administration of N-acetyl-cysteine as if the mother was being treated alone,E,"Current data suggest that the use of N-acetyl cysteine protects both mother and the fetus, since the fetal hepatotoxicity is possible with an overdose. N-acetylcysteine does not appear to be teratogenic. Current recommendations are to treat pregnant women with the same protocol as any ingestion, since the risk of not treating exceeds the potential risk of N-acetyl cysteine to the fetus."
pediatrics,154,"A 15-month-old girl presents with a generalised convulsion lasting eight minutes. She has previously been well and apyrexial, though she drinks about 3 litres/day of dilute juice. She was born at 37+4/40 weighing 3.9 kg and there were no neonatal problems. On examination she is apyrexial but remains drowsy. She is on the 75% for height and weight. Respiratory rate is 20/min and pulse is 100/min. There are no specific abnormalities to find. BM stix is 4.5 mmol/L. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Drug ingestion,Hypocalcaemia,Hypoglycaemia,Hyponatraemia,Idiopathic epilepsy,D,"She has had an afebrile generalised seizure. The history of polydipsia makes hyponatraemia the likely diagnosis. A large number of electrolyte disturbances can cause fits including:  hypoglycaemia hyponatraemia hypocalcaemia, and hypomagnesaemia."
pediatrics,155,"A 15-year-old boy from India presents with a four week history of cough and weight loss. Initially the cough was dry, but recently he has coughed up some blood. He has lost 8 kg in weight. He has previously been healthy. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date, including BCG at birth. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 38.5°C, and he has loose skin folds suggesting recent weight loss. He has crackles at the right base. A Mantoux test gives 12 mm induration after 48 hours. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Active tuberculosis,Latent tuberculosis,Miliary tuberculosis,Positive Mantoux due to BCG,Tuberculous meningitis,A,"In this case the chronic symptoms of fever, cough and weight loss, at risk background, and positive Mantoux test (more than 10 mm) make active TB likely. This can be confirmed by 3 × sputum for acid and alcohol fast bacilli (AAFB). Treatment requires at least two months of triple therapy and at least a further four months of double therapy. It is preferable to monitor this directly (directly observed therapy or DOT) to reduce the risk of relapse and the development of resistant organisms."
pediatrics,156,A 15-year-old girl with type 1 diabetes is found unconscious by her mother. She usually takes a basal bolus insulin regime. She had been at a party the night before and returned in the early hours that morning. Paramedics recorded a BM of 1.4 mmol/L. They gave 2 boluses of 10% dextrose and started on a dextrose infusion. On arrival in the Emergency department she starts to fit.

She has obvious nystagmus, dysdiadochokinesis and falls to the left when asked to walk. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Encephalitis,Medulloblastoma,Migraine,Opiate ingestion,Seizure,B,The history is of subacute cerebellar abnormality in the absence of fever. The most likely diagnosis is a posterior fossa tumour. This can be confirmed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The latter is preferable because the bony posterior fossa interferes with CT images.
pediatrics,158,A 6-year-old girl presents with multiple antibiotic allergies and a history of recurrent urinary tract infections. Which of the following antibiotics should always be avoided for paediatric use?,Amoxicillin,Cephalexin,Doxycycline,Erythromycin,Trimethoprim,C,"The answer is doxycycline. Tetracyclines can lead to permanent staining or discoloration of teeth and as such are contraindicated in the paediatric population. Other antibiotics best avoided in the paediatric population include the quinolones, which are associated with increased risk of tendon rupture in pre-clinical animal models. Trimethoprim is associated with reduced levels of folate but in practice over a short course this would not be considered a clinically significant problem. Penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides are generally considered a safe option."
pediatrics,159,"A 3-year-old girl presents with eye prominence, which has been worsening over the past three weeks. She has generally been tiring easily. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has proptosis of the right eye, with bilateral bruised appearance of the eyelids. She looks a little pale and quiet, but alert and cooperative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Buphthalmos,Cruzon's disease,Graves's disease,Neuroblastoma,Orbital cellulitis,D,"The appearance is of proptosis and periorbital ecchymoses, and is characteristic of metastatic neuroblastoma. This tumour of the sympathetic ganglia or chain is protean in presentations, and may secrete catecholamines producing hypertension. Most present with a large abdominal mass, which may embarrass breathing in infants. About 30% present with thoracic or cervical mass."
pediatrics,160,"A 3-year-old boy is brought unconscious to the paediatric assessment unit. He had suffered from chickenpox for five days with mild fever controlled by paracetamol and aspirin, but seemed to be recovering. Today he began vomiting profusely then became combative, later drowsy and unresponsive. On examination he is responding to pain. His respiratory rate is 10/min, heart rate 140/min and oxygen saturations 95% on air. He is completely floppy. There is no jaundice. He has 2 cm hepatomegaly and his BM stix is 0.9 mmol/L. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chickenpox encephalitis,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Hepatic failure,Hypoglycaemia,Substance abuse,C,"The history is highly suggestive of Reye's syndrome (fulminant hepatic failure). This starts with a prodromal illness, usually an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), and aspirin is an independent risk factor. It should only be given to children under 12 for specific indications (Kawasaki disease or rheumatic fever).   "
pediatrics,161,"An 11-year-old boy undergoes an indirect inguinal hernia repair. A few days after the operation, the boy complains of numbness over his left anterior scrotum and medial aspect of his thigh. Which nerve is most likely to have been affected during surgery?",Internal pudendal,Ilioinguinal,Iliohypogastric,Genitofemoral,Obturator,B,"The ilioinguinal nerve travels through the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is usually opened during indirect hernia repair, and the ilioinguinal nerve can be damaged. The internal pudendal nerve supplies the perineum and is more commonly damaged during childbirth. The iliohypogastric nerve supplies the skin over the lateral gluteal region and above the pubis. The genitofemoral nerve supplies the anterior surface of the scrotum too, but only the superior aspect of the thigh. It passes under the inguinal ligament so is unlikely to be damaged during indirect inguinal hernia repair. The obturator nerve supplies the medial compartment of the thigh but not the scrotum. "
pediatrics,162,A 7-year-old boy presents with a two week history of left-sided limb pain. On examination he has reduced movement in the left hip joint. A plain radiograph is highly suggestive of Perthes' disease. Which of the following regarding Perthes' disease is correct?,Has an incidence of 20% of in obese children,Is commonly seen in the 15-20 age group,Is bilateral in 10% of cases,Results in displacement through the growth plate with the epiphysis slipping down and back,Results in normal x ray appearance,C,"Perthe's disease is avascular necrosis of the femoral head, and affects those aged 3-11 years (commonest 4-7 years). It is bilateral in 10% with a Male to Female ratio of 4:1. Patients (children) present with pain in the hip or knees, and with a limp. All movements of the hip are restricted. It is not associated with obesity; obesity is a feature in patients with slipped upper femoral epiphysis. Early x rays show widening of the joint space; later there is decrease in the size of the nuclear femoral head with patchy density. Normal x ray is a feature of 'irritable hip' (also called transient synovitis). The important differential diagnoses for this condition are:  slipped upper femoral epiphysis irritable hip, and tubercular arthritis  "
pediatrics,163,"An 18-month-old boy who was born at term, with no complications, presents with delayed walking. You note he has scissoring of his legs when you lift him, increased tone and reflexes in his lower limbs but normal motor function in his arms. What is the most likely neuroanatomical site of the lesion?",Basal ganglia,Cerebellar cortex,Cerebellar vermis,Primary motor cortex,Subcortical motor fibres (bilateral internal capsule),E,"Bilateral damage to the subcortical motor fibres causes the classical picture of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. The underlying lesion is periventricular leukomalacia, which can be visualised on MRI scan. It is associated with maternal infection and raised levels of inflammatory mediator interleukin 6. This form of cerebral palsy is generally not associated with severe intellectual disability; 80-90% will eventually walk independently, and they are usually continent. Motor fibres descend from neurons in the primary motor cortex through the internal capsule and subcortical motor fibres. They synapse on the lower motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. Lesions of the primary motor cortex or internal capsule cause an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion with spasticity, weakness, clonus, and hyperreflexia. Lesions of the basal ganglia cause extrapyramidal signs such as bradykinesia and tremor. Lesions in the cerebellar cortex cause ipsilateral cerebellar signs (intention tremor, heel-shin ataxia, nystagmus). Lesions of the cerebellar vermis cause midline cerebellar signs such as gait ataxia and dysarthria. Lesions os the primary motor cortex would cause contralateral upper motor neuron signs of spasticity, clonus, and hyperreflexia. "
pediatrics,164,A 12-week-old child is about to receive vaccination with pertussis. In which of the situations below should the vaccine should be withheld?,He had febrile convulsions in the neonatal period,He was delivered by forceps,His sister aged 4 has epilepsy,The parents do not wish the child to receive the vaccination,There is an allergy to egg protein,D,"Allergy to egg protein, forceps delivery and family history of epilepsy are not contraindications. Convulsions, only if occurring within seven days of the first vaccine and not attributed to another cause are a contraindication. The vaccine should be withheld if the parents do not give consent. "
pediatrics,165,"A 15-year-old male presents with a two hour history of pain in the left testis. He is unaware of preceding trauma and feels that the pain has deteriorated with time. He feels nauseated and has been pyrexial. Whilst examining him he confesses to having a sexual relationship. On examination, he has a tender swollen left testis with a temperature of 37.5°C. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?",Arrange emergency admission,Arrange urgent referral to urology clinic (within two weeks),Reassure and re-assess in clinic in 24 hours,Take FBC and MSU and await results before prescribing.,Treat with clarithromycin,A,"In a male under 20 years of age who presents with acute testicular pain, torsion is the most important diagnosis to be considered and should not be missed. The most important action is admission for acute urology opinion as most testes can be saved if treated within six hours but almost none after 12 hours."
pediatrics,166,"A 7-year-old girl presents with a three day history of rash and ankle swelling. She had a cold four weeks previously, but has otherwise been healthy. She was born at 39+1/40 weeks, weighing 2.96 kg, with no neonatal problems. She takes no drugs or medications and is fully immunised. On examination she has palpable non-blanching purple spots 1-4 mm in diameter especially over the shins and buttocks. Her left ankle is swollen, warm and tender, with restricted movement. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Child physical abuse,Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Pneumococcal septicaemia,C,"The history is of preceding upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) followed by vasculitis on the shins and buttocks, and ankle swelling. This is classical of Henoch-Schönlein purpura. The pathological lesion is a vasculitis, hence the lesions are often palpable. In contrast thrombocytopenic purpura are not raised. The classical features are:  Rash Joint swelling Haematuria, and Gastrointestinal symptoms, e.g. vomiting, abdominal pain, PR bleeding, occasional intussusception."
pediatrics,167,"A 4-year-old girl presents with a three day history of fever, cough and respiratory distress. This has progressively worsened. She has previously been healthy. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a fever of 39.8°C, respiratory rate of 45/min with moderate recession, and pulse of 120/min. Oxygen saturations are 89% in air. She has a painful cough, which she tries to suppress. She has crackles at the right base. ENT examination is normal. Chest x ray shows consolidation of the right lower lobe. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,"Pneumonia, aspiration","Pneumonia, bacterial","Pneumonia, mycoplasma","Pneumonia, viral",C,"The history of fever, progressive cough and respiratory distress with focal crackles and chest x ray findings suggest a pneumonia. The height of the fever suggests a bacterial infection, but discrimination of bacterial from viral lower respiratory infection (LRI) is notoriously difficult, even on chest x ray. However, the lobar pneumonia and degree of illness make Pneumococcus the prime suspect. IV penicillin should be given for 48 hours or until the fever settles, followed by five days orally. Repeat chest x ray after four weeks is indicated if complications (for example, pleural effusion) are present to confirm complete resolution."
pediatrics,168,A child is scheduled for elective surgery under general anaesthesia. How long must the surgeons wait after the child has been breast fed? ,30 minutes,1 hour,2 hours,4 hours,8 hours,D,The child must be clear of breast milk for 4 hours and clear of fluids for 2 hours before the anaesthetic (similar to adults). The biggest risk of not fasting for 4 hours is the risk of aspiration. Shorter fasting times may sometimes be necessary where the risk of not conducting the surgery outweighs the risk of anaesthesia. Eight hours would be too long to wait. 
pediatrics,169,Which one of the following is true regarding inguinal hernia in infants?,Has a lower risk of recurrence in the preterm infant,Is more common in females,Is usually of direct type,May be managed conservatively if asymptomatic,May contain the ovary in girls,E,"Inguinal herniae are most common in boys and are usually indirect. Contents include bowel, bladder and ovary. They always require herniotomy and herniae are particularly prone to incarceration in infants below the age of 1 year. Preterm babies have a higher incidence of bilateral herniae and also of recurrence."
pediatrics,170,"A 3-month-old girl presents to the Emergency department. Her parents tell you that she is a difficult baby, she gets upset when trying to feed and seems uncomfortable. She has been vomiting on a daily basis many times a day and the parents had been given a prescription for antireflux medication but not tried it. They have brought her into to hospital today, as they are concerned that the vomits have changed colour and now look bright green. This has been associated with what the parents feel is abdominal pain. On examination, she appears not to be gaining weight and has abdominal distension with tenderness on palpation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Colic,Failure to thrive,Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,Malrotation,Meckel's diverticulum,D,"This infant has signs of acute intestinal obstruction - bile stained vomiting, abdominal distension and tenderness. If the infant has not presented earlier on in life they may go onto to have recurrent episodes of abdominal pain caused by intermittent volvulus. This infant has now presented with small bowel obstruction due to life threatening volvulus. Colic and reflux may account for the abdominal pain and vomiting but in this acute setting does not explain the bile stained vomiting. Although the child is not thriving this does not give the underlying diagnosis. Meckel's diverticulum usually presents with a rectal bleeding and is less commonly associated with bowel obstruction."
pediatrics,171,A 14-year-old female is admitted to the paediatric ward following ingestion of 25 500 mg paracetamol tablets. She states she did it because life is not worth living as her boyfriend of six months just broke up with her. She has a stable family background and a good relationship with her parents. She bought one packet of paracetamol from a local pharmacy and found the rest in the bathroom cabinet at home. You start her on n-acetyl cysteine (Parvolex) and the following morning refer her to the Community and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). Which feature of a suicide attempt should increased your concern that the individual may attempt suicide again?,A history of schizophrenia,A supportive family structure and good relationship with parents,Attempted suicide in the form of hanging,Female sex,The lack of a suicide note,C,"Suicide is the third leading cause of death amongst adolescents. Risk factors for suicide include  Male sex Broken home Disturbed relationships with parents Living alone Immigrant status Recent loss or stress Previous suicide attempt Drug or alcohol addiction.  Violent methods of suicide, attempts made in isolated places and a written suicide note are all significant factors that may indicate an individual will attempt suicide again. Only a minority of adolescents who attempt suicide have an underlying psychiatric disorder and this is not necessarily a risk factor for future attempts."
pediatrics,172,Regarding retinoblastoma which of the following statements is correct?,Bilateral involvement is found in 70% of cases,The predisposition may be inherited as an autosomal recessive condition,There is an increased risk of autoimmune disease,They have often metastasised by the time of diagnosis,They usually present with leucocoria,E,"The incidence is 1 in 16,000 live births. Genetic predisposition occurs in 20% of patients with unilateral disease, and 30% of patients with bilateral disease. The gene has been localised to 13q and the inherited form is associated with an increased risk of malignancy such as osteosarcoma and pineal tumours. It may be inherited as autosomal dominant. The commonest presentation is leucocoria (yellowish white pupil reflex), and there may be diminished or absent vision or strabismus. Late symptoms are:  pupil irregularity hyphema pain proptosis, and signs of raised intracranial pressure.  The tumours have rarely metastasised before they are detected. "
pediatrics,173,"A 3-year-old boy is referred with an incidental heart murmur, discovered during a recent upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). He has never been blue nor breathless and is otherwise healthy. He had a full term normal delivery and no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.6°C, respiratory rate 20/min and pulse is 100/min. Pink in air with no dysmorphic features. Pulses of normal volume, normal praecordium and apex beat. Heart sounds normal, with 2/6 ejection murmur maximal at the upper left sternal border and conducted to the back. No liver palpable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic coarctation,"Atrial septal defect, secundum",Innocent murmur,Pulmonary stenosis,Ventricular septal defect,D,"The history is of a healthy boy with heart murmur, maximal in the pulmonary area and conducted along the line of the pulmonary arteries. This is likely to be due to pulmonary stenosis. In valvular stenosis an ejection click may be heard. The requirement for treatment can be gauged by measuring the transvalvular gradient on echodoppler. Pulmonary valvotomy may be possible via a cardiac catheter. Valve replacement may be required later. An innocent murmur is not conducted, no louder than 2/6, and either blowing (venous hum) or vibratory. Both tend to change with posture.   "
pediatrics,174,A 10-year-old girl presents with pallor and mild jaundice. She has recently moved to the United Kingdom from the Indian subcontinent. She had frontal bossing and maxillary overgrowth. She has multiple small scars on her abdomen. On palpation of her abdomen she is noted to have hepatosplenomegaly. You suspect beta thalassaemia major and wish to make a rapid diagnosis. What is the best test to confirm the diagnosis in this case?,Blood film,Bone marrow aspirate,Full blood count,Genetic testing,Haemoglobin electrophoresis,E,"All the tests mentioned will aid towards the diagnosis.  However, the haemoglobin electrophoresis will detect extremely high level of haemoglobin F (approximately 90%) with no haemoglobin A and increased or normal haemoglobin A2. A blood film will demonstrate microcytic hypochromic anaemia, marked anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, basophilic stippling, target cells and red cell fragments (also seen in haemolytic uraemic syndrome). A full blood count will demonstrate increased nucleated red cells, white cells and platelets. Although genetic testing is extremely useful this would not necessarily be a first line investigation."
pediatrics,175,"A 16-year-old girl presented to the nephrology clinic with a four day history of steadily increasing generalised oedema. There was no past history of note. On examination she weighed 45 kg. Her blood pressure was 90/55 mmHg. Investigations revealed:    Serum creatinine 55 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum albumin 20 g/L (37-49)    24 hour urinary protein excretion 4.8 g (less than0.2 g). Ultrasound scan of kidneys normal. If this patient is treated with prednisolone (1 mg/kg for six weeks), what are the chances of her disease going into complete remission?",<20%,20-39%,40-59%,60-80%,>80%,B,"This girl has probably developed idiopathic glomerulonephritis, which accounts for 90% of all childhood cases of the nephrotic syndrome. The main cause is minimal change nephrotic syndrome. The first line treatment for minimal change nephropathy is prednisolone for four to six weeks (60 mg/m^2) reducing to 40 mg/m^2 for a further four to six weeks. With this treatment 93% of children will respond with complete loss of proteinuria within eight weeks. However, once remission is induced, 66% of children will have at least one relapse (34% will have complete remission). Between 40 and 55% of children affected, who initially respond to steroids will develop multiple relapses when the steroids are reduced. Early, frequent relapses (three or more in the first six months) signify a relapsing course, and requires treatment with cyclophosphamide."
pediatrics,176,"A 15-year-old boy was treated with permethrin cream for scabies infestation, with the treatment being repeated after 7 days as recommended. On follow-up three weeks later he was found to have continuing infestation. What is the most likely reason for this?",Facial skin was not treated,Non-disposal of underwear,Other household members were not treated,The organism is resistant to permethrin,The treatment was not repeated for a third time as recommended,C,"Scabies is an intensely pruritic and highly contagious infestation of the skin acquired through close personal contact. A delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mites, their eggs, or excreta occurs approximately 30 days after infestation and is responsible for the intense pruritus that is the hallmark of the disease. Treatment is topical, and often with permethrin. Application should be repeated 7 days after initial treatment to kill any mites hatched from eggs in that time, and if done properly treatment failures are uncommon. Recurrence of the eruption usually means re-infection has occurred, and this is often from close household contacts. All household members and close personal contacts should therefore be treated whether or not they are symptomatic and patients should be re-examined two weeks after treatment to evaluate effectiveness."
pediatrics,177,"A 12-year-old girl presents with joint pain and stiffness of four months duration. This affects the hands, wrists, elbows, knees and ankles bilaterally, and she is stiff in the mornings. Paracetamol has been of little benefit. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.7°C, respiratory rate 12/min and pulse 80/min. She has swelling of the MCP and IP joints of all digits bilaterally. Her wrists, elbows, knees and ankles have limitation of movement and are swollen and warm. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Dermatomyositis,Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis,Reactive arthritis,Systemic juvenile arthritis,C,"The symmetrical prolonged joint pain and swelling are characteristic of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthtitis. Involvement of the temperomandibular joints can cause micrognathia, and cervical involvement can cause atlanto-axial instability."
pediatrics,178,According to NICE guidelines for the management of mild obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) which of these is the most appropriate initial management?,Cognitive behavioural therapy involving family/carers,Guided self help,Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs),Personal cognitive behavioural therapy,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),B,"The definition of OCD from the NICE guidelines on Obsessive compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder (CG31) is:  andquot;OCD is characterised by the presence of either obsessions or compulsions, but commonly both. Symptoms can cause significant functional impairment and/or distress. An obsession is an unwanted intrusive thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters the person's mind. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that the person feels driven to perform. These can be either overt and observable by others, such as checking that a door is locked, or a covert mental act that cannot be observed, such as repeating a certain phrase in one's mind.andquot;  Guided self help should be the first step in treatment for those suffering from OCD with mild functional impairment. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) involving family/carers should be the next step if self help is ineffective or has been refused. It should not be considered before self help has been tried in those with mild functional impairment. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) is incorrect as other antidepressants, except SSRIs, are not recommended in the management of OCD. Personal cognitive behavioural therapy is incorrect as if cognitive behavioural therapy is used it is more effective when family/carers are involved. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) is incorrect as although SSRIs are the drug treatment of choice they should only be considered with CBT and the need for them carefully assessed in those suffering with moderate to severe functional impairment."
pediatrics,179,"A 14-day-old infant is admitted with jaundice. She was born at term weighing 3.98 kg, and has been breast feeding well and gaining weight. Stools are yellow. No family or social history of note. On examination she looks well and well hydrated. The temperature is 36.5°C, respiratory rate 34/min and pulse 124/min. There is no palpable liver or spleen or rash. The serum bilirubin is 245 μmol/L (15 conjugated). What is the most likely diagnosis?",ABO incompatibility,Breast milk jaundice,Hypothyroidism,Physiological jaundice,Urinary tract infection,B,"The picture is one of prolonged unconjugated jaundice in an otherwise healthy breast-feeding infant. Therefore hypothyroidism (congenital) and infections (UTI) are ruled out. The most likely diagnosis is breast milk jaundice. It is useful to exclude UTI (urine dipstix) and hypothyroidism (easily treatable). Features of hypothyroidism include:  hoarse cry sluggish reflexes constipation lethargy poor feeding, and jaundice.  If suspected, hypothyroidism should be diagnosed and treated quickly to prevent mental retardation (reversible if treated quickly). ABO Incompatibilty occurs as a result of maternal IgG antibodies crossing the placenta and attacking fetal red blood cells (haemolysis). Jaundice occurs soon after birth, within 24 hours. It differs from Rhesus Isoimmunization (RI) as it can occur in the first born (50% of cases) unlike RI which occurs in subsequent pregnancies. Physiological jaundice is a diagnosis of exclusion."

On examination his temperature is 36.97°C, heart rate 95/min and respiratory rate of 20/min. He has dry flaky skin around his mouth, which he licks frequently. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Contact dermatitis,Erythema multiforme,Impetigo,Kawasaki disease,Primary Herpes simplex,A,"The history of local dryness associated with licking is a form of contact dermatitis. Recurrent contact with irritant, such as saliva, bubble bath, detergents, soaps and citrus juices inflame the skin. Sweat may result in a similar foot problem. Treatment is with emollients and avoidance of the trigger."

The most appropriate treatment is mebendazole. Other drugs that are used include piperazine but this drug is not recommended for use in epilepsy. Therefore mebendazole is most appropriate. Praziquantel may be used for tapeworms."
pediatrics,183,A 3-year-old child is noted to have a lesion on the left cheek and a diagnosis of impetigo is considered. Which one of the following statements is true regarding impetigo?,Characterised by scab-covered weeping lesions,Restricted to the face,Transmitted via the faecal-oral route,Usually caused by Candida albicans,"With dry, itchy and scaly lesions",A,"Impetigo is a skin infection, caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or both. It leads to the formation of scabby, yellow-crusted sores and, sometimes, small blisters filled with yellow fluid. It can occur anywhere in the body, but commonly occurs in the face, arms or legs. It spreads by direct person-to-person contact. It is highly contagious but does not require admission for formal isolation. However, affected children should stay off school until they have had 48 hours of effective treatment. Attention should be paid to personal hygiene particularly to hand washing and drying of hands. The child should have his/her own towel. "
pediatrics,184,"A 4-day-old girl is admitted with jaundice, which was first noted the previous day. The pregnancy had been normal.

On examination her temperature is 36.8°C, respiratory rate 32/min and pulse 110/min. Her current weight is 3.10 kg. There is moderate jaundice over face and trunk. There is no liver enlargement and her stools are pigmented. What is the most likely diagnosis?",ABO incompatibility,Breast milk jaundice,Hypothyroidism,Physiological jaundice,Rhesus disease,D,"The history is of jaundice beginning on day three in an otherwise healthy child. The heart rate and respiratory rate are normal for age. This suggests physiological jaundice. Rhesus disease and ABO incompatibility tend to cause early jaundice (less than36 hours). Rhesus disease is usually associated with a positive Coombs test. This is less commonly positive in ABO incompatibility. Breast milk jaundice and hypothyroidism cause prolonged jaundice (greater than14 days in a term baby, and greater than21 days in a preterm baby. The degree of jaundice is assessed by serum SBR, and phototherapy may be required if it exceeds the treatment threshold. A urine dipstick should be performed to exclude occult UTI. "
pediatrics,185,"A 35-year-old man presents with an inherited neurological disorder. His father developed the disease in his 60s and his daughter was born 2 years ago with a severe form of the condition. His mother, sister, wife and other child, a son, are unaffected. What is the genetic basis underlying this condition?",Autosomal recessive inheritance,Mitochondrial disease,Polygenic inheritance,Trinucleotide repeat disease,X-linked inheritance,D,"The inheritance from this man's father, to himself and then to his daughter shows increasing disease severity and earlier onset of disease in subsequent generations. This is genetic anticipation and is typical of trinucleotide repeat disease where there is expansion of the repetitive sequence of three nucleotides with each generation. Also the length of the expansion increases as cells divide through an individual's life. Trinucleotide repeat diseases include:  Huntington's disease Myotonic dystrohpy Fragile X syndrome Friedreich's ataxia"
pediatrics,186,You are asked to review a 9-year-old child on the paediatric surgical ward who complains of nausea and vomiting a few hours after undergoing appendicectomy. The nurses ask you to prescribe an appropriate antiemetic. Which of the following agents is predominantly an antihistamine antiemetic and would be an option in this case?,Cyclizine,Domperidone,Droperidol,Metoclopramide,Prochlorperazine,A,"Cyclizine is a piperazine derivative with antihistamine and antiemetic properties. There is extensive experience of its use in the paediatric population, and it is not prokinetic, as such it is an appropriate option here. All of the other options have some dopamine antagonist activity. Although domperidone is well tolerated in the paediatric population, it is also prokinetic, as such it is potentially best avoided in the immediate period after surgery. All dopamine agonists may be associated with acute dystonic reactions, although the risk of these reactions is less with domperidone versus the others."

pediatrics,189,During fetal development there are changes to the fetal circulation. In fetal life the right and left ventricles exist in parallel circuits. The placenta provides gas and metabolic exchange. Three cardiovascular structures unique to the fetus exist. A pregnant woman who is on anticonvulsants has been sent for fetal echocardiography. Which of the following conditions can be diagnosed from this?,Anomalous left coronary artery,Atrial septal defect (ASD),Coarctation of the aorta,Large ventricular septal defect,Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),D,"Fetal echocardiography has limitations as the three cardiovascular structures  Foramen ovale Ductus arteriosus Ductus venosus  mean that, for instance, you are unable to say whether an ASD or PDA will occur. It is also limited in that some abnormalities may not manifest themselves clearly until after the fetus is born such as coarctation, total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage or anomalous left coronary artery. However, fetal echocardiography can diagnose  Ebstein's anomaly AVSD Hypoplastic left heart syndrome Transposition of the great arteries and Large VSDs."
pediatrics,190,You are asked to see a 15-year-old girl in the emergency department who has made repeated cuts on her arms. Which one of the following features is a risk factor for suicide in adolescents?,Anxious parents,Female sex,First attempt,Living with family,Presence of a suicide note,E,"Suicide is the third leading cause of death in adolescents. Risk factors for suicide include:  Male sex Broken home Immigrant status Living alone Family history of affective disorder, suicide or alcohol abuse Recent loss or stress Previous suicide attempt, and Drug or alcohol addiction.  Violent attempts, attempts in isolated places and the writing of a suicide note are also worrying features."
pediatrics,191,A 14-year-old boy presents to the orthopaedic clinic with a worsening scoliosis. He also has pes cavus and absent deep tendon reflexes but an extensor plantar response. Which condition would be associated with these features?,Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Friedreich's ataxia,Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy,Spinal muscular atrophy type 1,Spinal muscular atrophy type 2,B,"Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder affecting both the upper and lower motor neurones. Symptoms typically begin between 5 to 15 years of age. Spinocerebellar tract degeneration accounts for the motor ataxia. The posterior column degeneration accounts for the loss of position and vibration senses and the sensory ataxia. The loss of large neurones in the sensory ganglia causes tendon reflexes to diminish. The lower corticospinal tracts are affected later in the disease, which accounts for the bilateral extensor plantar response. Babies with SMA type 1 rarely live beyond 1 year of age. Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (Charcot-Marie-Tooth) is associated with pes cavus and scoliosis, but all deep tendon reflexes are diminished or absent. Scoliosis: Lateral curvature of spine, rotation of vertebral bodies and viscera cause reduced chest wall compliance (restrictive) and reduced PaO2, then:  Hypoventilation Hypercapnia, and Cor pulmonale.  Surgical correction may be needed. Features of positional scoliosis (80%) include:  Idiopathic (adolescent female) Unequal leg length, and Muscle spasm.  Features of structural (20%) - hump due to ribs, high shoulder and convex on side of scoliosis - are:  Marfan's Neurofibromatosis type1 Duchenne muscular dystrophy Spinal muscular atrophy Freidreich's ataxia Polio Osteogenesis imperfecta Klippel-Feil Alagilles, and Mucopolysaccharidoses."
pediatrics,192,"A 41+5/40 boy is born weighing 4.2 kg by emergency caesarian section after failed forceps delivery. The cardiotocography (CTG) showed prolonged bradycardias in late stage 1, and thick meconium had been seen when the membranes ruptured. He is delivered covered in thick meconium, and receives oral suction as the cord is cut. His Apgars are 2 at 1 minute and 4 at 5 minutes. The cords are visualised on the resuscitaire and some thick meconium removed. Air entry is equal, and the abdomen looks normal. Cord gas shows a pH of 7.02, BE -24 mmol/L. He is intubated and ventilated, requiring settings of 20/4, 100% oxygen, 0.4 s to maintain saturations of 91%. What is the most likely aetiology?",Birth asphyxia,Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Congenital pneumonia,Meconium aspiration,Persistent fetal circulation,D,"The history is of fetal distress, acidosis and meconium aspiration, with the latter being the primary event. The high ventilatory and oxygen requirements suggest that there may be secondary persistent fetal circulation. These babies are often very ill and may require intensive support, such as high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), nitric oxide or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy."
pediatrics,193,Which of the following is correct concerning idiopathic intracranial hypertension?,A mildly increased CSF cell count is typical,Frequently presents with ataxia,Is distinguished from hydrocephalus by the absence of suture separation,Is typically associated with focal long tract signs,May be caused by prolonged steriod therapy,E,"Benign intracranial hypertension (also known as pseudotumour cerebri) is a clinical syndrome that mimics brain tumours. It is characterised by raised intracranial pressure with normal CSF cell count and protein content, normal ventricular size, anatomy and position. It can be caused by metabolic disorders such as:  galactosaemia hypoparathyroidism pseudohyperparathyroidism hypophosphatasia steroid therapy hypervitaminosis A vitamin A deficiency Addison's Disease obesity menarche oral contraceptives, and pregnancy.  Infections can also be a cause:  roseola infantum chronic otitis media mastoiditis Guillain-Barré Syndrome.  Causes can also include haematological disorders:  polycythemia haemolytic and iron deficiency anaemia, and Wiskott Aldrich Syndrome.  Another cause can be the destruction of intracranial drainage by venous thrombosis, lateral sinus or posterior saggital sinus thrombosis, head injury, obstruction of the superior vena cava. Nalidixic acid and tetracycline are also known causes. It usually presents with headache and vomiting, though this is rarely as bad as that associated with posterior fossa tumour. Diplopia is common due to sixth nerve palsy. Children are alert with no systemic upset. A bulging fontanelle, cracked pot sounds, or separation of the cranial sutures may be present. Papilloedema with an enlarged blind spot is the most consistent sign beyond infancy. Focal and neurological signs indicate a process other than pseudotumour cerebri. It may be complicated by optic atrophy and blindness. Most can be treated conservatively with monitoring of visual acuity. For others, multiple lumbar punctures may be necessary to reduce intracranial pressure. Very rarely are shunts required. "

pediatrics,195,"A young woman attends a pre-pregnancy counselling clinic. She has previously had two pregnancies which were terminated, the first at 22 weeks gestation following her anomaly scan showing anencephaly and the second at 16 weeks following an ultrasound scan at 15 weeks gestation again showing anencephaly. She is with the same partner who was the father of the last two pregnancies. She took standard pre-pregnancy and early pregnancy folic acid in her first pregnancy and subsequently took high dose folic acid pre-pregnancy and in early pregnancy in her second pregnancy, as per protocol for patients who have had a pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect. She wants to know what the risk of her conceiving another child with anencephaly is. What risk do you advise her of?",2%,4%,8%,10%,15%,D,"Anencephaly is a neural tube defect, which is not compatible with life. There is a large defect in the calvarium, meninges and scalp with only a rudimentary brain. Most of these infants, if not terminated, die within a few days of birth. The incidence is approximately 1 per 1000 live births and the highest rates are found in Wales and Ireland, although the frequency worldwide is declining. In couples who have had one previous affected pregnancy the risk is 4% but in those who have had two previously affected pregnancies the risk increases to 10%. Multiple factors are thought to increase the risk of anencephaly but their exact mechanism is unclear, these include low socioeconomic status, nutritional and vitamin deficiencies (especially folate deficiency), environmental factors and exposure to toxins.  Couples who have had an anencephalic infant should have regular ultrasound screening including a scan between 14-16 weeks gestation, amniocentesis, alphafetoprotein measurements and the mother should also take high dose folic acid pre-pregnancy and during early pregnancy."

pediatrics,198,"A 2-year-old boy is brought into the Emergency department resuscitation severely unwell. The parents noticed at home that he had a fever and was drowsy with some vomiting. He had been put to sleep in his bedroom, but his mother on going to check on him, noticed a widespread raised red rash that was increasing in front of her eyes and that he was grunting. In Accident and Emergency, resuscitation is initiated and some results arrive back from the laboratory as follows: PT and APTT time both prolonged, platelets 20 ×10^9/L and the haematology technician reports that the fibrinogen level is low. What is the explanation for these blood test results?",Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Idiopathic thrombocytopenia,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Meningococcal meningitis,Meningococcal septicaemia,A,"This little boy presents with features consistent with meningococcal septicaemia. However, the exact cause for the blood test results is actually disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Causes of DIC include:  Sepsis Malignancy Trauma Burns Hypovolaemic shock, and Neonatal hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy.  Results of a clotting screen will show an increased bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time and decreased platelets. A helpful technician will also run a fibrinogen level, which will be low and look for fibrin degradation products, which will be high."
pediatrics,199,"A 1-year-old child has recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and bronchopneumonia. His full blood count shows a normal haemoglobin concentration, normal white cell count but low lymphocyte count. His total immunoglobulin concentration is also low. What is the likely diagnosis?",AIDS,Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,Cystic fibrosis,Hypogammaglobulinaemia,Severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome,E,"The combination of low lymphocyte count and low immunoglobulin concentration suggests SCID. The defining feature of SCID, commonly known as andquot;bubble boyandquot; disease, is a defect in the specialised white blood cells (B- and T-lymphocytes) that defend us from infection by viruses, bacteria and fungi. Without a functional immune system, SCID patients are susceptible to recurrent infections such as pneumonia, meningitis and chicken pox, and can die before the first year of life. Though invasive, new treatments such as bone marrow and stem-cell transplantation save as many as 80% of SCID patients. It appears to be X linked in as many as 50% of cases."

Which one of the following percentages is the correct risk?,0%,25%,50%,75%,100%,C,As both parents are carriers of the CF gene then the chance of another child being affected (homozygote) is 1 in 4 (25%). The chance of their child being free from the CF gene is also 1 in 4 (25%) and the chance of a child being a carrier (heterozygote) is 1 in 2 (50%).
pediatrics,201,A young child is seen with peeling of the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. Which of the following is a potential explanation for this presentation?,Chickenpox,Kawasaki disease,Measles,Mumps,Urticaria,B,"Kawasaki's disease is an acute vasculitis of medium sized vessels, which classically involves the coronary arteries. Diagnosis is based on the presence of a prolonged fever for more than five days with typical mucocutaneous changes and lymphadenopathy. Desquamation of the fingers and toes begins in the periungual region, may involve the palms and soles, and usually is observed one to two weeks after the onset of fever. Chickenpox is associated with a pruritic, vesicular rash, appearing mostly on the head, neck and trunk. Skin peeling is not a feature. Measles appears as a generalised macular rash. The rash begins on the head and spreads to the trunk and extremities over a few days. The rash usually lasts for at least three days, but then fades in the order of appearance. It can leave behind a brownish discolouration and can become confluent over the buttocks. There is no rash associasted with mumps. Urticaria is characterised by red patches and weals."
pediatrics,202,A 6-year-old boy is reviewed in the paediatric respiratory clinic as he has been struggling to control his asthma with the treatment provided by his primary care provider. His asthma is particularly exacerbated by his hayfever which he suffers from in the spring and summer months. Which type of hypersensitivity reaction is described above?,Type 1,Type 2,Type 3,Type 4,Type 5,A,"Hypersensitivity reactions are defined by the immunoglobulin mediating the process and the mechanism by which they occur: Type 1 IgE-mediated:   Mechanism - Mast cell degranulation  Conditions include - asthma, hay fever, food allergy, anaphylaxis  Type 2 IgG and IgM-mediated:  Mechanism - Altered signalling and complement activation Conditions include - haemolytic anaemias, autoimmune anaemias and autoimmune skin conditions (pemphigoid, pemphigus)  Type 3 IgG-mediated:  Mechanism - Immune complex deposition Conditions include - Serum sickness, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, rheumatoid/reactive arthritis, SLE  Type 4 T cell-mediated:  Mechanism - Cytokine production, cytotoxic t-cell action Conditions include - Contact dermatitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, graft versus host disease  Type 5 unknown mediator and unclear mechanism of action:  Conditions include autoimmune hepatitis, systemic autoimmune disease."
pediatrics,203,A newborn baby is noted to have ambiguous genitalia. There are no palpable gonads. Chromosome results confirm karyotype of girl (46XX). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (21-hydroxylase deficiency),Congenital adrenal hypoplasia,Klinefelter's syndrome,Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome,Turner syndrome,A,"Of the enzyme defects that cause virilisation in female fetuses, 21-hydroxylase deficiency congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is the most frequent cause accounting for 90-95% of cases. Absence of palpable gonads in association with otherwise apparently male genitalia should always alert one to the possibility of a virilised female. If CAH is suspected, salt wasting occurs in 70% of cases of 21-hydroxyalse deficiency between days four and 15 and hence needs close monitoring of electrolytes. "
pediatrics,204,A 17-year-old boy has learning difficulties and is seen in the genetics clinic as his maternal uncles also had learning difficulties. Examination reveals that the patient has large ears and large testes. What is the most likely genetic diagnosis?,47 XYY,Acromegaly,Fragile X syndrome,Klinefelter’s syndrome,Mosaic Down’s syndrome,C,"In addition to moderate to severe mental retardation, other characteristics of individuals with Fragile X syndrome may include:  large ears macroorchidism prognathism speech delays prominent forehead double-jointedness autistic symptoms, and occasional self-mutilation.  The face is typically long and narrow, with a high arched palate and large ears. Otitis media, strabismus, and dental problems may be present. Other common characteristics include:  hyperextensible joints hypotonia, and heart problems, including mitral valve prolapse.  In post pubertal males, abnormally large testes are a distinctive feature. The following can occur In young children:  delayed motor development hyperactivity behavioural problems toe walking, and occasional seizures."
pediatrics,205,Select which of the following is correct in relation to congenital heart disease?,"Atrial septal defects (ASDs), in contrast with ventricular septal defects, never close spontaneously",Failure to thrive is often found associated with Fallot's tetralogy at under 3 months of age,"In Down's syndrome with an endocardial cushion defect, irreversible pulmonary hypertension occurs earlier than in children with normal chromosomes",The murmur of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) is likely to be loud in the first day of life,Transposition of the great vessels is the most common congenital cyanotic heart disease,C,"ASDs often close spontaneously and the chance of spontaneous closure is related to size, that is, 5-8 mm 80% closure, whereas if the defect is greater than 8 mm then there is little chance of closure. Fallot's tetralogy more commonly presents beyond 3 months of age. The murmur of VSD is intensified after one month of life. Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease."
pediatrics,206,A 1-year-old girl is referred to clinic as her parents are concerned that she is not gaining weight. She has had chronic diarrhoea for several months and is suffering from recurrent ear infections and skin abscesses. Her blood results show a neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. She had an adequate normal sweat test and her pancreatic enzyme activity was found to be reduced. Which of the following conditions fits best with the clinical picture and results?,Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Cystic fibrosis,Fanconi anaemia,Jeune's syndrome,Shwachman-Diamond syndrome,E,"This child shows a classical presentation of Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. Shwachman-Diamond syndrome is an autosomal recessive exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. It is associated with:  Neutropenia in 90% Thrombocytopenia in 70% Anaemia in 50%.  It usually presents in infancy with:  Recurrent infections Short stature and failure to thrive Malabsorption Steatorrhoea with a deficiency of fat soluble vitamins.  Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is incorrect as the child has a chronic picture of symptoms. In ALL, the symptoms occur following bone marrow infiltration. Generalised fatigue, anaemia, and bruising usually predominate and if untreated can be potentially fatal over a matter of weeks. A pancytopenia is usually found although a very high white count can also be seen, which carries a poor prognosis. Cystic fibrosis is characterised by abnormal transport of chloride and sodium across the epithelium, leading to thick secretions. A sweat test is gold standard for diagnosis - a sweat chloride concentration of greater than 60 mmol/l is consistent with a diagnosis of CF. Whilst CF affects pancreatic functions and can cause failure to thrive, it does not usually affect haematopoiesis and the sweat test was normal in this patient. Fanconi's anaemia is an inherited bone marrow failure. While it could account for the neutropenia, thrombocytopenia and failure to thrive, it does not usually present with pancreatic insufficiency and would usually demonstrate a pancytopenia. Jeune's syndrome is also known as asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy and is an inherited form of dwarfism, associated with short limbs, small chest and kidney problems. It can be associated with failure to thrive but does not classically present with failure of haematopoiesis. If pancreatic insufficiency does occur it is usually in much older patients."
pediatrics,207,A young child is brought to clinic with severe eczema. Which of the following statements concerning his treatment is correct?,Might benefit from a diet free of cow's milk,Should be given a course of oral steroids,Should be treated with the aim of complete cure,Should not be immunised against measles,Should not be immunised against pertussis,A,"Cow's milk allergy may precipitate severe eczema, and trial of soy-based formula may have beneficial effects on the infant's condition. Complete cure is not always a practical aim of treatment. Amelioration of symptoms using appropriate preventative measures and topical preparations may minimise but not totally eradicate the condition. Most infants grow out of the condition by the time they are 2- to 3-years-old. There is no current evidence to suggest that infants with eczema should not receive measles or pertussis immunisation, but they should not be immunised if there is a concurrent skin infection. Oral steroids are a last resort of treatment and are only rarely used in infants with severe eczema."
pediatrics,208,"A 9-year-old girl attends the obesity clinic, having been referred by her GP. She complains of having difficulty seeing at night and is also struggling at school. What is the most likely cause of her obesity?",Bardet-Biedl syndrome,Klinefelter syndrome,Overeating,Polycystic ovary syndrome,Prader-Willi syndrome,A,"The night blindness is an early feature of retinitis pigmentosa, associated with Bardet-Biedl syndrome. Causes of obesity (BMI greater than98th centile for age and sex) include:  Excess food intake/reduced expenditure Chromosomal/genetic (trisomy 21, Prader-Willi, Klinefelter, retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, polydactyly, mental retardation, hypogonadism) Endocrine (hypothyroidism. Cushing's syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) Oncological (e.g. pituitary tumour).  In the given example, Prader-Willi syndrome is the incorrect answer.

Which organism is the commonest cause of exacerbation of this condition?,Human papilloma virus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,Trichophyton mentagrophytes,Varicella-zoster virus,C,The patient has atopic dermatitis affecting mainly his flexures. Patients with atopic dermatitis commonly experience exacerbations of their condition due to infection with Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment would then include a course of anti-Staph antibiotics. The other infections listed here are not particularly associated with worsening of atopic dermatitis.
pediatrics,210,"A 3-year-old girl presents with abdominal mass, discovered incidentally by mother at bathtime. She has otherwise been well, apart from occasional abdominal discomfort. On examination she looks well. She has a 10 cm mass in the left flank, which is firm and minimally tender. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mmHg. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Constipation/encopresis,Inborn errors of metabolism,"Malignancy e.g. neuroblastoma, Wilm's, lymphoma",Phaeochromocytoma,Renal anomalies,C,"The history is highly suggestive of Wilm's tumour. This usually presents with painless abdominal mass not extending across the midline. Bilateral cases are well described. In neuroblastoma, patients tend to be less well and the mass may extend across the midline."
pediatrics,211,"An 18-month-old girl presents at 1 am with stridor. She has had a cold for 48 hours, with low-grade fever, but went to bed as usual at 7.30 pm. She awoke four hours later crying and distressed, with a barking cough. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Asthma,Croup,Gastroesophageal reflux,Sinusitis,C,This is a classical history of viral croup. Most of these episodes are one-off and settle rapidly without treatment or with dexamethasone orally.
pediatrics,212,Which antibiotic regimen should be prescribed as prophylaxis after a first typical UTI in a 6-year-old girl with no allergies?,"If initial urinary tract infection was Escherichiacoli, trimethoprim for three months, otherwise low dose nitrofurantoin for same time period","If initial urinary tract infection was Escherichia coli, trimethoprim until imaging comes back clear, otherwise low dose nitrofurantoin for same time period","Low dose daily antibiotics until all imaging comes back clear, choice of antibiotic depends on local policy",Low dose trimethoprim once daily until all imaging comes back clear,No antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended,E,"One of the major changes in practice resulting from the NICE guidelines concerns the use of prophylactic antibiotics. Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended after the first episode of UTI. Prophylaxis does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence and may increase the risk of antibiotic resistance. Prophylaxis should be considered in cases of recurrent UTI however - the usual first line depends on local microbial guidelines. The alternative answer options are all incorrect as no antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated. Other measures to prevent recurrence include:  Encourage high fluid intake Emphasise importance of not delaying voiding Avoid constipation Emphasise good hygiene (for example, front to back wiping) Eliminate dysfunctional voiding.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Child physical abuse,Cough petechiae,Enteroviral infection,Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Idiopathic Thrombocytopaenic purpura,C,"This child is well, and presents with purpuric spots and a low-grade fever. Although about 20% of such children have serious bacterial infection and 7-10% have meningitis/ septicaemia, this still leaves 70% who have some sort of viral infection. A large number of viruses (e.g. Varicella and EBV) can present in this way, although in clinical practice the specific cause is rarely found. In ITP there is often a preceding viral illness 2-4 weeks before, the child is usually pre-school age, and the petechiae are more marked. "

pediatrics,215,A 2-year-old boy is referred by the GP to the outpatient clinic with a heart murmur which was discovered incidentally during a consultation for upper respiratory infection. Which one of the following would lead you to consider a murmur to be innocent?,Associated fixed splitting of the second heart sound,Associated thrill,Marked variation in intensity with change of posture,Pansystolic duration,Radiation towards the left axilla,C,Innocent murmurs are of short duration and vary with posture. A thrill implies significant turbulence and hence valvular disease. Radiation to the axilla implies mitral incompetence and fixed splitting implies an atrial septal defect (ASD).
pediatrics,216,Which of the following statements regarding kernicterus is incorrect?,Diagnosis requires the histological confirmation of yellow staining of brain tissue on autopsy caused by fat soluble unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia,Is associated with gastrointestinal haemorrhage,"May cause a chronic syndrome of athetosis, gaze disturbance and hearing loss",May cause convulsions,Usually occurs in the first month of life,A,"Intracellular crystals are noted in intestinal mucosa of affected infants. This may be related to GI haemorrhage. The chronic syndrome of neurologic sequelae observed following marked hyperbilirubinemia includes:  athetosis gaze disturbance, and hearing loss.  If the affected infant survives the neonatal period and subsequently dies, the yellow staining of neural tissue may no longer be present, but the basal ganglia will display microscopic evidence of cell injury, neuronal loss and glial replacement."

What is the most appropriate response that the father can make during these episodes?",Big boys don't cry,I left your mother but I am not leaving you,I will see you next weekend,Sorry son but I just couldn't live with your mother,You take care of the house now I've left,B,The child's reactions typically represent a feeling of abandonment and it is important that his father reaffirms that he is not leaving his son.
pediatrics,219,"A 2-year-old girl is brought to the paediatric assessment unit with conjunctivitis and erythema of her hands and feet. She has been febrile for the past seven days and has had diarrhoea and vomiting. She is drinking well but is complaining of a sore mouth when she eats. On arrival her temperature is 38.5°C, with a heart rate is 110 beats per minute and respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. On examination she has conjunctival injection, cracked red lips and a 'strawberry red' tongue. She has cervical lymphadenopathy and red, swollen hands and feet. She has dual heart sounds with no added sounds. Her chest x ray and ECG are normal. Which is the single most likely diagnosis?",Endocarditis,Kawasaki's disease,Rheumatic heart fever,Rubella,Scarlet fever,B,"Kawasaki's disease, endocarditis and rheumatic fever are all forms of acquired heart disease. Kawasaki's disease is the most common form of acquired heart disease in the developed world. Kawasaki's disease is an acute vasculitis of medium sized vessels, which classically involves the coronary arteries. Diagnosis is based on the presence of a prolonged fever for more than five days with typical mucocutaneous changes and lymphadenopathy. Classical features include:  Conjunctival injection Cracked red lips A strawberry red tongue Lip fissures Erythema of the hands and feet, with oedema and eventual skin peeling.  Non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain, nauseas, diarrhoea and vomiting are also common. Coronary arteritis and aneurysm formation can result in myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Early detection and treatment with aspirin and immunoglobulin within the first 10 days of presentation can reduce the risk of cardiac complications. Endocarditis may present with prolonged fever but characteristically lacks the mucocutaneous changes of Kawasaki's disease. Typical features include night sweats, joint pains and evidence of infective emboli (splinter haemorrhages) and signs of an immune-mediated vasculitis (Roth spots and Olser nodes). There may be a history of underlying congenital heart disease or previous rheumatic heart disease. Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune process secondary to group A beta haemolytic streptococcal infection resulting in valvular damage (typically mitral). Diagnosis is based on the Jones criteria, which require evidence of recent streptococcal infection (usually a pharyngitis), plus two major criteria or one major and two minor criteria. None of the major criteria (polyarthritis, erythema marginatum, chorea, subcutaneous nodules or signs of carditis) are present. Scarlet fever is also caused by a group A beta haemolytic streptococcal infection, and may be complicated by rheumatic fever, but presents with a typical 'sand paper like' rash rather than erythema. Rubella has a characteristic red-pink rash that fades to leave areas of flaking skin. If contracted in pregnancy rubella can cause congenital heart disease in the unborn child."
pediatrics,220,"A 15-year-old girl is brought in by her parents because she has been acting strangely for the past six months. She has had depression for the past eight months. Nevertheless, she was previously well with no concerns other than going out with friends and drinking alcohol. Her gait has become unstable and her speech is becoming harder to understand. Her father and mother suffer from epilepsy and depression, respectively. On examination, you note a well-looking girl, sitting still in bed but with lateral nystagmus and slurred speech. When asked to walk, she does so with wide-based steps and fails to walk tandem. Sensation and other clinical examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcohol-related neurological disease,Cannabis intoxication,Friedreich's ataxia,Phenytoin toxicity,Sydenham's chorea,D,"There are several side effects of phenytoin. Cerebellar dysfunction is one adverse effect, but there is also gum hypertrophy, rash, hepatotoxicity, psychosis, and many others. This child has shown signs that indicate cerebellar dysfunction. Therefore, Sydenham's chorea can be excluded, bearing in mind that patients with Sydenham's chorea cannot sit still. The most likely cause here is phenytoin toxicity, given that her father is epileptic and the mother has depression, in addition to the cerebellar signs that are consistent with phenytoin toxicity. Alcohol-related neurological disorders are usually seen in older age groups rather than teenagers. In addition, other clinical signs are usually seen such as sensory neuropathy; this is also true for Friedreich's ataxia, where it is expected to show pes cavus, heart problems, and problems with sensation and proprioception."
pediatrics,221,"A 4-year-old girl is brought to the Emergency department by her mother. She was found chewing paracetamol tablets, having picked up a full strip off the kitchen counter; the mother does not know how many tablets she has taken but thinks it might be up to eight, some 45 minutes earlier. One examination she looks well and is playing happily, her BP is 105/72 mmHg, pulse is 70 and there is some evidence of dried paracetamol tablets on her chin. Which of the following is the most appropriate way to treat her?",Admit overnight for observation,Check paracetamol levels at four hours,Reassure the mother and discharge,Treat with IV N-acetylcysteine,Treat with oral N-acetylcysteine,B,"The answer is check paracetamol levels at four hours. We are not given this patient's weight, and a dose of eight tablets, which equals 4 g, may well be significant. Whilst paediatric metabolism of paracetamol appears to be associated with a lower risk of saturation and N-acetyl-p-benzo-quinone imine (NAPQI) formation in acute overdose, cases of liver failure and fatalities are still reported. The level at four hours should be checked against the overdose nomogram and N-acetylcysteine started accordingly. Blind treatment with N-acetylcysteine is not indicated as it is recognised to lead to significant toxicity for some patients. Reassurance and discharge, or admission for observation are certainly not indicated without knowledge of the four hour paracetamol level."

The fontanelle will be sunken and haematocrit will be raised. An increased urea will be seen in this degree of dehydration. Oral feeding should be continued whenever possible.
pediatrics,223,A 5-year-old boy has demonstrated an inability to make eye contact and likes to play alone. He has delayed language skills and repetitive behaviours. You suspect he has autism. What other symptoms is the boy likely to have?,Heel walking,Increased muscle tone,Malnutrition,Sensation seeking behaviours,Vomiting,D,"The clinical scenario describes the three features that must be present for a diagnosis of autism to be made:  Problems with social development Delayed communication, and Repetitive behaviours.  Other features include motor signs such as poor muscle tone and toe walking, difficulty with eating such as food refusal and eating rituals although this does not usually lead to malnutrition. Many children have sensory abnormalities and either an under- or over-responsiveness to stimuli. They may also demonstrate rare talents or an impressive memory. "

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic multifocal osteomyelitis,Reactive arthritis,Septic arthritis,Sickle cell crisis,Systemic lupus erythematosis,E,"The prolonged history of fever, malaise, joint pains, malar rash and renal involvement point to a multisystem disease. In this ethnic group systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most likely diagnosis. This can involve any system and is a great mimic. Treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for joints plus immunosuppressives for the renal involvement. Therapy may be difficult and prolonged."
pediatrics,226,"A 6-month-old girl attends respiratory clinic with her parents for the results of her sweat test. Her parents ask how common cystic fibrosis is. If 1 in 25 Caucasians carry one mutant cystic fibrosis gene, use your knowledge of the inheritance of cystic fibrosis to calculate approximately how many Caucasian babies are born with cystic fibrosis:",1 in 25,1 in 625,1 in 1250,1 in 2500,1 in 5000,D,"Autosomal recessive inheritance refers to the pattern of inheritance of a condition directly or indirectly due to a recessive faulty gene copy located on an autosome, one of the chromosomes numbered 1-22. If a condition is recessive, a person can be a carrier whilst not having the actual condition. Examples of autosomal recessive conditions are:  Cystic fibrosis Beta thalassaemia Phenylketonuria Spinal muscular atrophy Congenital adrenal hyperplasia.  As 1 in 25 Caucasians carry one mutant cystic fibrosis gene, the risk of two people both being carriers is 1 in 625, which is required for the transmission of an autosomal recessive condition. The risk of having an affected child if both parents are carriers is 1 in 4. Therefore:  1/625 = 0.0016 0.0016/4 = 0.0004 ( i.e. 1 in 2500)  1 in 25 is incorrect since this is the carrier risk. 1 in 625 is incorrect. This assumes that if both parents are carriers all offspring would have cystic fibrosis 1 in 1250 is incorrect. This assumes that if both parents are carriers the risk of having an affected child would be 1 in 2."

This will lead to a deficiency of aldosterone production which is responsible for sodium reabsorption, and potassium and hydrogen excretion in the distal convoluted tubules. This will lead to hyponatremia and hyperkalaemia with metabolic acidosis which is usually compensated by respiratory alkalosis, but not in this case as the patient is asthmatic. The mainstay of treatment is steroid replacement. IV hydrocortisone is the preferred method. Oral prednisolone is used for asthma exacerbations and cannot be given now as the patient is drowsy and vomiting. Insulin-dextrose infusion, IV or nebulised salbutamol are all appropriate adjunct treatment if hyperkalaemia starts showing ECG changes.  "
pediatrics,230,A 3-year-old boy is assessed in your local community child development clinic.

He has 3 cm of spleen. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Haemaglobinopathies e.g. sickle cell, thalassaemia","Haemolytic anaemia, congenital or acquired",Iron deficiency,Malignancy,Occult blood loss,B,"The history suggests mild anaemia, probably due to haemolysis in view of the icterus and splenomegaly. Although beta thalassaemia may rarely present in this way, the absence of a family predisposition make this unlikely. The likely diagnosis is therefore hereditary spherocytosis, and the maternal splenectomy suggests that she is also affected. Blood film (and HP) contain microspherocytes due to a loss of membrane and therefore surface area so that the area of central pallor is lost. It is a common, usually autosomal dominant, genetic disorder, affecting 1:2,000-1:5,000 Caucasians. Clinical features are very variable; it may be diagnosed at birth (severe), in adulthood, or not at all. "

Which of the following statements correctly applies to his condition?,Hypokalaemia occurs,It has an X-linked inheritance,If untreated he may be infertile later,There is over-production of cortisol,Undescended testes is associated,C,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia has an autosomal recessive inheritance. Failure to synthesise cortisol by the adrenals leads to a feedback activation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production by the pituitary. Potassium retention occurs as a consequence of aldosterone deficiency. Undescended testes are not associated, however testicular adrenal rest tumours are associated. Undertreated patients may be infertile later due to the presence of high circulating androgens."
pediatrics,235,Which of the following may cause a downbeat nystagmus?,Aqueduct stenosis,Benign paroxysmal vertigo,Central cerebellar lesion,Chiari type I malformation,Unilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus lesion,D,"Nystagmus is defined as involuntary oscillations of the eyes. This may be pendular when the oscillations are equal in rate and amplitude, or jerking when there are quick and slow phases. (The quicker phase is used to define the direction.) Nystagmus may be caused by:  Visual disturbances Lesions of the labyrinth The central vestibular connections Brain stem or cerebellar lesions.  Pendular nystagmus is usually due to loss of macular vision, but may be seen in diffuse brain stem lesions. Jerking nystagmus which is of constant direction regardless of the direction of gaze, suggests a labyrinthine or cerebellar lesion. Nystagmus which changes with the direction of gaze suggests widespread central involvement of vestibular nuclei. Jerking nystagmus presents only on lateral gaze, the fast component of which is in the direction of gaze and indicates a lesion of the brain stem or cerebellum. Nystagmus confined to one eye suggests a peripheral lesion of the nerve or muscle, or a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle. Nystagmus restricted to the abducting eye on lateral gaze (ataxic nystagmus) is due to a lesion of the medial longitudinal bundle between the pons and mid-brain as in multiple sclerosis (MS). Nystagmus occurring on upward gaze with the fast component upwards (upbeat nystagmus) may be due to a lesion in the mid-brain at the level of the superior colliculus. Downbeat nystagmus (fast phase downwards) suggests a lesion in the lower part of the medulla. It is therefore typical of the Arnold-Chiari malformation.  Wernicke's encephalopathy is another rare cause. "
pediatrics,236,A phenotypically normal 8-year-old boy has a sibling with cystic fibrosis. What is the chance he is a carrier?,1 in 2,1 in 4,1 in 8,2 in 3,Very small,D,"With one affected sibling, the parents must both be carriers. In the case of CF, compared to other illnesses, the chance of one or both of the parents having CF is low as being able to reproduce in an affected adult female or affected adult male is extremely low. In this question, it is expected to make the assumption that both parents are carriers. An 8-year-old who is phenotypically normal at this age does not have CF as the symptoms would have become apparent by now. The boy therefore could be either a carrier or normal and so his chance of being a carrier is 2 out of 3. For autosomal recessive disorders, the son or daughter of an affected individual has a 100% chance of being a carrier."
pediatrics,237,A term baby is found to have a unilateral impalpable testicle at his newborn examination. His penis looks normal and the rest of his examination is normal. What is the most appropriate management?,Keep the patient in hospital and ask for urgent urological and endocrine opinions,Keep the patient in hospital and ask for an urgent abdominal/scrotal ultrasound and undertake karyotyping,Organise for a reassessment by the GP at 3 months of age and if the testes are still not descended to refer to a paediatric surgeon or paediatric urologist,Organise for a reassessment by the GP at 1 year of age and if the testes are not descended then refer to a paediatric surgeon or paediatric urologist,Reassure the parents that testes are often not down at birth and will come down with time,C,"Undescended testes are most commonly diagnosed during the routine newborn examination. The incidence is:  1-3% in term neonates 13% in preterm babies 2000-2499 g, and 45% in neonates less than2000 g.  The testes can continue to descend after birth. It is recommended to reassess the position of the testes at 3 months of age (or 52 weeks post-conceptual age in premature infants). Up until 3 months of age the cremasteric reflex is absent so the true location of the testis can be detected more easily. After this an active cremasteric reflex can result in retractile testes being misdiagnosed as undescended testes. On examination, a retractile testis can be manipulated down to the bottom of the scrotum and will remain there; a truly undescended testis cannot be brought down. In patients with bilateral undescended testes, a referral should be made to a paediatric surgeon or paediatric urologist (both specialties manage this condition). They will organise:  Karyotyping to confirm the sex Human chorionic gonadotrophin stimulation test to determine the presence of functioning testicular tissue Diagnostic laparoscopy to investigate for intra-abdominal testes and bring them down to the scrotum in two stages if present (Fowler-Stephens orchidopexy).  Please note that imaging is not reliable for determining the presence or absence of testes and hence is not routinely undertaken. Evidence suggests that the longer the testes remain out of the scrotum, the more histologically abnormal they become, which can affect fertility and risk of cancer. Hence, the British Association of Paediatric Urology has issued a consensus statement recommending orchidopexy as early as 3-6 months of age. In reality, most surgeons operate around 1 year of age because there is a theoretical risk of increased testicular atrophy rate in younger infants because the operation is more technically challenging.

pediatrics,238,A 10-year-old child is suspected of having Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Which of the following statements would support this diagnosis?,Histology reveals adenomatous polyps,Neither parent is affected,The child has an iron deficiency anaemia,The child has aphthous ulceration of the mouth,There are axillary pigmented lesions,C,"The small intestinal polyps are hamartomas and not adenomas. Recent data suggest that Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a premalignant condition but the risk is low. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. As a result, children with one affected (heterozygotic) parent have a 50% chance of developing the condition. It can present as anaemia in childhood. The anaemia is a hypochromic microcytic anaemia resulting from iron deficiency. The circumoral pigmented lesions are a characteristic feature of this condition."
pediatrics,239,Which of the following is the most significant problem in bone marrow transplantation in immunocompromised patients?,Delayed hypersensitivity reactions,High risk of leukaemia following transplant,Inability to use a live donor,Potentially lethal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD),Severe mucositis leading to massive fluid loss,D,"GVHD is a major problem in patients undergoing BMT. It can be minimised by choosing donors that are as closely matched as possible to the recipient. Hypersensitivity reactions do not occur following BMT in immunocompromised patients.  Live donors are often used, and bone marrow may be harvested from a sibling for example.  Whilst leukaemia may relapse following BMT, it is highly unlikely that the BMT itself will precipitate leukaemia.  Whilst mucositis may form part of the GVHD, it is not the only problem in this case and therefore is an incorrect response in this instance."
pediatrics,240,"You are asked by one of the nursing staff to speak to a 15-year-old girl who is refusing to have a Port-a-Cath inserted. You realise that the situation is complex and explain that you will need to return with your consultant. When assessing her capacity, which explanation would be correct to give her?","Although she is only 15-years-old, she may have the capacity to consent, depending on her maturity and ability to understand what is involved","If she were 16-years-old and in England, if she were deemed not to have capacity she would be treated as an adult who lacks capacity","If she were 16-years-old and in Scotland, her parents could consent to investigations and treatment that are in her best interests","Once you have deemed her to have capacity this will not change, regardless of her health or emotional state",The girl's parents can always override her competent consent to treatment,A,"The GMC provide guidance on 0-18 years for all doctors. This guidance states: andquot;The capacity to consent depends more on young people's ability to understand and weigh up options than on age. When assessing a young person's capacity to consent, you should bear in mind that:  At 16 a young person can be presumed to have the capacity to consent A young person under 16 may have the capacity to consent, depending on their maturity and ability to understand what is involved.  You should remember that a young person who has the capacity to consent to straightforward, relatively risk-free treatment may not necessarily have the capacity to consent to complex treatment involving high risks or serious consequences.andquot; The legal framework for the treatment of 16- and 17-year-olds who lack the capacity to consent differs across the UK. In Scotland, 16- and 17-year-olds who do not have the capacity to consent are treated as adults who lack capacity and treatment may be given to safeguard or promote their health. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, however, parents can consent to investigations and treatment that are in the young person's best interests. In England and Wales, treatment can also be provided in the young person's best interests without parental consent, although the views of parents may be important in assessing the young person's best interests. The capacity to consent can also be affected by their physical and emotional development and by changes in their health and treatment. Parents cannot override the competent consent of a young person to treatment that you consider is in their best interests, but you can rely on parental consent when a child lacks the capacity to consent. In Scotland parents cannot authorise treatment a competent young person has refused. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the law on parents overriding young people's competent refusal is complex."
pediatrics,241,A 2-year-old boy develops a barking cough associated with inspiratory and expiratory stridor. A diagnosis of laryngotracheobronchitis is reached. What is the most likely outcome associated with the disease if left untreated?,Bronchiectasis,Complete resolution,Empyema,Lobar pneumonia,Lung abscess,B,"This is croup which affects young children (6 months to 6 years) causing stridor and a seal-like barking cough. It is caused by a number of viral agents and is usually self-limiting. The treatment is by supportive treatment only. Mild cases can be managed at home and do not require admission to hospital. Croup may be complicated by lobar pneumonia in severe cases. Bronchiectasis, empyema and lung abscess may complicate pneumonia or other lung sepsis but not for the majority of cases. The single most important complication, not listed, is tracheal obstruction requiring ventilation. Severe cases of croup need to be managed by the most senior anaesthetist and paediatrician available."
pediatrics,242,What is a likely explanation for the high prevalence of cystic fibrosis in European populations?,Heterozygotes may have an advantage because of increased resistance to cholera,Inbreeding is common among Europeans,Many different mutations can cause cystic fibrosis,Most of the disease genes are hidden in heterozygotes,The locus has a high mutation rate,A,"The prevalence of the cystic fibrosis gene at around 1 in 20 of the population would suggest that this provides some evolutionary survival advantage. Like sickle cell trait offering a survival advantage to malaria, it is believed that the cystic fibrosis gene offers a possible survival advantage against cholera and enteropathogenic bacteria.  andquot;Cholera opens chloride channels, letting chloride and water leave cells. The CFTR protein does just the opposite, closing chloride channels and trapping salt and water in cells, which dries out mucus and other secretions. A person with CF cannot contract cholera, because the toxin cannot open the chloride channels in the small intestine. Carriers of CF enjoy the mixed blessing of a balanced polymorphism. They do not have enough abnormal chloride channels to cause the labored breathing and clogged pancreas of cystic fibrosis, but they do have enough of a defect to prevent the cholera from taking hold. During the devastating cholera epidemics that have peppered history, individuals carrying mutant CF alleles had a selective advantage, and they disproportionately transmitted those alleles to future generations. However, because CF arose in Western Europe and cholera in Africa, perhaps an initial increase in CF herterozygosity was a response to a different diarrheal infection.andquot;^1  "

The bone is more elastic. Due to the remodelling potential of paediatric fractures angulation and displacement, if not excessive, are usually well tolerated. Immobilisation of fractures is also well tolerated in general. The periosteum in children is thick and can often be used as an aid to hold reduction."
pediatrics,244,"A 3-year-old boy is seen in accident and emergency complaining of soreness at the end of his penis. He is otherwise systemically well and afebrile. He can still pass urine OK, although his mother says he does get ballooning on micturition. On examination, his prepuce is non-retractile. The distal prepuce is pink with no obvious scarring. On forward protraction of the prepuce there is a reasonable aperture. It is not inflamed and there is no swelling or pus discharge. A urine dipstick is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute balanitis,Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO),Fungal infection,Microscopic scarring of the distal prepuce most likely secondary to withdrawing of the foreskin causing small tears,Normal foreskin,E,"At birth the foreskin is almost always non-retractile with the inner layer attached to the underlying glans (preputial adhesions). The foreskin becomes retractile and the adhesions separate naturally over a variable time period. At 3 years of age approximately 20% of boys have a non-retractile foreskin and 80% have persisting preputial adhesions. By 10 years of age approximately 8% have a non-retractile foreskin and 50% preputial adhesions. By 16 years, the majority have a retractile foreskin with no remaining adhesions. As the preputial adhesions separate from the underlying glans there can be a mild inflammatory response, which can result in soreness. This is the most likely scenario in this case. A creamy discharge, called smegma, can be released at this time, which can be mistaken for pus. Ballooning of the foreskin during micturition often occurs in early childhood, typically between the ages of 2-4 years, when there is some preputial separation but the foreskin is still non-retractile. The parents can be reassured that the ballooning does not represent any obstruction; it is transient and self-limiting. Acute balanitis normally results in swelling and erythema of the distal penis with overlying oedema of the prepuce and purulent discharge. A swab should be taken for microscopy, culture, and sensitivity, and a course of antibiotics given. BXO looks like a ring of white scarring at the end of the foreskin. By comparison, a normal non-retractile foreskin has a pink pout on gentle retraction and looks supple. BXO is irreversible and progressive, sometimes affecting the underlying glans, and hence requires a circumcision. Severe cases can result in urinary obstruction. Referral should be made to a paediatric surgeon. "

pediatrics,247,"A 15-year-old girl is admitted in a state of collapse after taking an unknown quantity of her father's blood pressure tablets. On arrival in the Emergency department she is hypotensive with a BP of 80/50 mmHg, and a pulse of 38. Her blood sugar is measured at 2.5 mmol/l. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",IV 10% dextrose,IV adrenalin,IV calcium gluconate,IV glucagon,IV noradrenalin,D,"The answer is IV glucagon. Given this girl is hypotensive and hypoglycaemic, with a pulse of below 40 BPM, overdose of beta blockers seems the most likely underlying cause. IV glucagon is effective in increasing pulse and blood pressure and reversing hypoglycaemia, but much larger doses are usually required as opposed to treating a conventional hypoglycaemic episode. Atropine may also be added. IV adrenalin and IV noradrenalin are associated with unacceptable risks of arrhythmias and should be avoided in this situation. IV 10% dextrose will reverse hypoglycaemia, but not hypotension and bradycardia. IV calcium gluconate is useful in calcium channel antagonist overdose."
pediatrics,248,You are asked to counsel a young woman who is pregnant. Her older brother died from Duchenne muscular dystrophy at the age of 20. The woman already has a son who is 5-years-old. He did not walk until he was 2-years-old and whilst he can walk now he finds it difficult to run. A Gower's test is positive. The woman's husband is fit and well and the couple are non-consanguineous. The mother wants to know the risk of her unborn baby having Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Select the most accurate answer.,If the infant is a boy there is a 25% chance he will have the condition,If the infant is a boy there is a 50% chance of him being a carrier of the mutation,If the infant is a girl there is a 50% chance of her being a carrier of the mutation,If the infant is a girl there is no risk of her having the condition,The sex of the child is irrelevant - there is no risk they will inherit the condition,C,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an X linked recessive condition. In this case the young woman who is pregnant has had an older brother with the condition and also has a son who is showing signs of the condition. This implies she must be a carrier of the condition. X linked recessive conditions usually only affect boys as they only have one X chromosome and if the X chromosome they receive (which can only be inherited from their mother) carries the mutation then they will be affected by the condition. Girls usually are not affected by X linked recessive conditions as they have two X chromosomes, one from the father and one from the mother. If they inherit an abnormal X chromosome from the mother but a normal X chromosome from the father then they should not be affected as the condition is recessive. However there is a process known as Lyonisation (also known as the skewed x-inactivation pattern). Lyonisation involves the random and sporadic 'switching off' of some genes on one of the X chromosomes. If the genes switched off are from the normal X chromosome then the mutated genes from the other X chromosome will be activated, therefore, and although rare, it is a possibility that a girl could show features of Duchenne muscular dystrophy. In X linked recessive conditions there is a 50% chance that any female offspring will be a carrier of the condition and there is a 50% chance that any male offspring will be affected by the condition. Male offspring will not be carriers as they will be affected by the condition."
pediatrics,249,"A 12-year-old boy presents with a history of fever and cough for the past two days, associated with sore throat, lethargy, and generalised non-itchy rash. Clinical examination revealed generalised lymphadenopathy with splenomegaly, chest wheeze and fine crepitations with no signs of respiratory distress. Investigations reveal:    White blood cell count 8 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Neutrophils 5.6 ×10^9/L (3-10)   Lymphocytes 2 ×10^9/L (2-8.5)   Eosinophils 0.24 ×10^9/L (0.1-2.0)   Basophils 0.16 ×10^9/L (0.0-0.1)   Haemoglobin 102 g/L (115-155)   Platelets 176 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Reticulocytes 0.9% (0.2-2.0)   C-reactive protein 32 mg/L (less than5)   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 16 mm/h (0-13)    Cold agglutinin test is positive. Chest x ray shows diffuse left lung consolidation especially at the lower zone. What is the most appropriate treatment?",Amoxicillin,Augmentin,Clarithromycin,IV ceftriaxone with clarithromycin,Supportive care,C,"Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common organisms that cause pneumonia in school-aged children. It is the smallest living organism in both size and number of genes. Unlike many other bacteria, it does not have a cell wall; therefore, medicines that attack the genetic component rather than the cell wall should be used to eradicate this bacterium. There are multiple clues to point to the diagnosis in this scenario, with school age being the most important. Additionally, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and non-itchy rash (erythema multiforme) are all indicators of mycoplasma infection. Normal white blood cell count with relative neutrophilia is another non-specific indicator, while the chest x ray signs in a child who does not have respiratory distress are typical of mycoplasma infection, hence the name andquot;walking pneumoniaandquot;, where the child will be walking as if they do not have severe pneumonia. Respiratory symptoms can be only one component of secondary cold agglutinin disease associated with mycoplasma infection. Other components include cold agglutinin-mediated acrocyanosis, haemoglobinuria, and chronic fatigue."
pediatrics,250,Which of the following statements is true of congenital hypothyroidism?,Can present in the newborn period with haemolytic jaundice,Cannot be diagnosed clinically before 3 months of age,If undiagnosed causes short stature but with a normal bone age,May be associated with an ectopic thyroid gland,Thyroxine may be discontinued after a period of treatment,D,"Patients with congenital hypothyroidism may exhibit non-specific clinical features, for example, jaundice and poor feeding, however macroglossia is a fairly specific clinical finding aiding diagnosis. The commonest cause of congenital hypothyroidism is an absent or ectopic gland. The need for thyroxine is life long. The hyperbilirubinaemia is unconjugated but is not due to haemolysis. Short stature and delayed bone age occur."
pediatrics,251,"A 2-year-old girl presents with failure to thrive and unusual gait. The mother started noticing this as soon as the child started walking two months ago. She is mainly feeding formula milk, and there is no other significant family history other than the parents are 2^nd degree relatives. Clinical examination reveals she has bowed legs, thick wrists and dental caries. Her height and weight are below the 3^rd percentile for her age. The following lab results are obtained:    Calcium normal   Phosphorus low   Parathyroid hormone high   25-hydroxycholecalciferol normal   1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol low   Alkaline phosphatase high   Urine calcium low   Urine potassium high    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autosomal recessive hypophosphataemic rickets,Dietary phosphorus deficiency,Vitamin D-deficiency rickets,"Vitamin D-dependent rickets, type 1","Vitamin D-dependent rickets, type 2",D,Deficiency of active vitamin D will result in low serum calcium and phosphorus. Low calcium will stimulate parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion which tries to increase serum calcium but decreases serum phosphorus more. The PTH-driven increment of serum calcium will lead to normal calcium levels. 
pediatrics,252,"At his six week check, a boy is noted to have a loud systolic murmur. The pregnancy was uncomplicated. An echocardiogram shows a structurally intact heart with ventricular hypertrophy. What is the most likely cause of this?",Diabetic mother,Familial,Friedreich's ataxia,Noonan's,Pompe disease,B,"Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy occurs as an autosomal dominant inherited disease in approximately 50% of individuals with the disorder. In children hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can also occur secondary to other paediatric diseases.

pediatrics,253,A 5 months baby presents with recurrent vomiting. Mother noticed some of the vomitus is blood stained. Choose the single most likely investigation?,Upper GI endoscopy,Barium meal,US (ultrasonography),Colonoscopy,CT abdomen,A,"Probable diagnosis is infantile pyloric stenosis. Pyloric stenosis usually affects babies between 2 and 8 weeks of age, but can occur anytime from birth to 6 months. Slight hematemesis of either bright-red flecks or a coffee-ground appearance is sometimes observed. Preferred investigation is ultrasonography. If US can not establish the diagnosis we go for barium meal and if both are non-diagnostic we go for endoscopy. As the question wants “SINGLE” most likely investigation it means the definitive or gold standard investigation which is upper GI endoscopy"
pediatrics,254,"An 11-year-old girl is admitted with drowsiness and difficulty in breathing. She was well until three weeks ago when she began feeling tired and losing weight. She has been very thirsty and has been drinking lots of Lucozade (high glucose drink) to give her energy. There is no other history of note except that her mother has 'thyroid disease'. On examination she responds only to pain. She has deep sighing breathing at 15/min, and a heart rate of 100/min. Her temperature is 36.8°C (tympanic). Oxygen saturations are 97% in air. She has cool peripheries and a capillary refill time of 4 seconds. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Child abuse,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Hepatic failure,Hypoglycaemia,Substance abuse,B,"The history of weight loss, polydipsia and polyuria over three weeks suggests diabetes mellitus. Other autoimmune diseases run in the family. She has decreased level of consciousness, early shock and Kussmaul breathing so the diagnosis is diabetic ketoacidosis. The BM stix here was 48 mmol/L."

The fontanelle may be normal in the initial stages. The commonest aetiology in newborn babies is group B Streptococcus, which may be acquired during or after delivery. The mortality is 5-15% in infants. Of those who survive a proportion may be left with the following, rather than conductive deafness:  Mental retardation Speech problems Visual impairment Neural deafness.  Meningomyelocele is a risk factor for the introduction of meningeal infection. "
pediatrics,256,"A 17-year-old girl presents with a two week history of urticaria. Over the last couple of days she has been aware of new lesions occurring on a daily basis, with the old lesions disappearing within 24-hours. Which one of the following statements is most likely to be correct?",She is likely to have an associated asthma,She is likely to have taken penicillin recently,She is unlikely to have any identifiable trigger factor,The lesions will be present for at least 24 hours,There is likely to be a nut allergy,C,"Uritcaria can be classified into idiopathic, immune or non-immune. Up to 50% of cases are idiopathic, as is likely in this case where the episodes do not seem to be associated with exposure to a particular substance. Peanut allergy and penicillin may cause urticarial rashes but there is usually an associated specific history of contact with the allergen. Urticarial lesions usually last less than 24 hours, but it is possible that multiple crops may appear."
pediatrics,257,"A female infant is born at 28+4/40 gestation weighing 1.01 kg. She requires 13 day ventilation, 2 day CPAP and then continued nasal prong oxygen at 0.02 L/min. At 8 weeks of age she still has this oxygen requirement. Capillary gases show pH 7.38, pCO2 9.5 kPa, base excess of +8 mmol/L. She is discharged home on oxygen at 0.02 L/min. Four weeks after discharge she presents to the paediatric ward with respiratory distress. Her O2 saturation is 85% in nasal prong oxygen of 0.02 L/min. She has respiratory rate of 60/min, marked recession, scattered crepitations with occasional wheeze, and heart rate of 165/min. There is 2 cm hepatomegaly. What is the most likely acute diagnosis?",Bronchiolitis,Bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Cardiac failure,Pneumonia,Wilson-Mikitty syndrome,A,"She fulfills the definition of chronic lung disease, which is O2 dependence at 36/40 corrected age. This condition is caused by a combination of O2 therapy, barotrauma (from ventilation) and fluid overload. The result is:  ongoing lung scarring decreased lung compliance, and gas exchange.  There is respiratory acidosis (CO2 retention) with compensatory metabolic alkalosis. These infants have diminished lung reserve and are very vulnerable to respiratory infections, with a greatly increased risk of PICU. Her second presentation is likely to represent an acute infection, most probably bronchiolitis. "
pediatrics,258,"A 3-year-old boy presents with an itchy rash. This has been present on his wrists and hands for three weeks and disturbs his sleep. He was born at 37+2/40 weighing 3.56 kg and there were no neonatal problems. He is fully immunised and on no medication. His 5-year-old sister has a similar rash. On examination his temperature is 36.4°C, RR 20/min and HR 90/min. He has red raised papules around his wrist and small linear skin breaks in the finger webs. Otherwise there are no abnormalities to find. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ammoniacal dermatitis,Atopic dermatitis,Impetigo,Napkin candidiasis,Scabies,E,"The history of itchy papular rash worst at night, affected sibling, and finding of burrows all point to scabies as the diagnosis. As the female mites burrow and bury their eggs and faeces, toxic and antigenic substances cause the condition."
pediatrics,259,"A 4-year-old boy presents with poor urine output for the past two days. He has had abdominal pain and diarrhoea for the past seven days, which started having bloody streaks after the third day. There was an outbreak of diarrhoea in his day-care centre recently. Clinical exam revealed only mild dehydration and pallor. The following blood tests are obtained:    White blood cell count 7 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Neutrophils 4.2 ×10^9/L (3-10)   Lymphocytes 2.38 ×10^9/L (2-8.5)   Eosinophils 0.45 ×10^9/L (0.1-2)   Basophils 0.07 (0.0-0.1)   Haemoglobin 91 g/L (95-150)   Platelets 67 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Reticulocytes 7% (0.2-2.0)   C-reactive protein 12 mg/L (less than5)   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 10 mm/h (less than13)   Urea 8.2 mg/dL (2.5-7)   Creatinine 163 µmol/L (60-110)    Which of the following tests would help in establishing the diagnosis?",Blood film,Clotting screen,LDH,Serum potassium levels,Serum sodium and potassium with urine sodium and potassium,A,"Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is comprised of:  Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia Thrombocytopenia, and Nephropathy.  Most of the cases occur in the paediatric population, related to outbreaks of Escherichia coli O157:H7. The presence of schistocytes, which is a sign of microangiopathic haemolysis, and confirming thrombocytopenia, will yield the diagnosis of HUS. This is further supported by the clinical history and anaemia. Serum potassium levels and LDH are expected to be high because there is renal failure and haemolysis, but this is not specific and will not help in establishing a diagnosis. Measuring electrolytes in the serum and comparing it with urine electrolytes is one way to differentiate the subtypes of renal failure, but will not yield a diagnosis in this case. "
pediatrics,260,"In the management of 2-year-old child with burns, which of the following is correct?",A urine output of 0.5 ml/kg/hr is an indicator of adequate hydration,Inotropic support is rarely required in burns less than 15% total body surface area,Lund and Browder chart accurately estimates the percentage of burns,"Once damp dressings are placed over the burns, they should not be removed till the child reaches the burns unit","Once the burn wounds are dressed, they should be left undisturbed for five days",C,"Damp dressings can cause hypothermia in children; therefore, continuous assessment of the child is essential. Lund and Browder chart takes account of child proportions while the rule-of-nines is useful in adult burns; in children, head makes up 14% of the total body surface area and the legs make up only 14%. Urine output of at least 1 ml/kg/hr is required in this age group; 0.5 ml/kg/hr is adequate in adults. Inotropes such as dopamine may be required if the urine output is not satisfactory. The wound depth should be estimated again after 24-48 hours, since a partial thickness burn may progress to a full-thickness burn, thus altering the management plan."
pediatrics,261,A 7-month-old boy is presented to a doctor by his parents with symptoms of recurrent upper respiratory tract infections. No other members of the family suffer from any smiliar infections. Physical examination showed mild facial hypoplasia. Biochemistry investigations revealed hypocalcaemia. Microbiological investigations were normal and immunoglobulins were within normal limits. Which of the following deficiencies would be shown by the infant's immune function?,B cell number and function,Complement deficiency,Macrophage number and function,Plasma cell,T cell number and function,E,This child suffers from DiGeorge's syndrome. Patients with DiGeorge's syndrome often have near normal levels of immunoglobulins but with significant decreases in T cell numbers and relative increase in the percentage of B cells.
pediatrics,262,A 17-year-old girl with known cystic fibrosis presents with a chest infection. What antibiotic would be most suitable for her?,Amoxicillin,Augmentin,Cefotaxime,Ceftazidime,Gentamicin,D,"In cystic fibrosis the airways become obstructed by thick mucus due to defective chloride secretion and increased sodium resorption. This leads to bacterial colonisation early in life. The bacteria present depend on the age of the patient: infants and young children become colonised by Staphylococcus aureus and then Haemophilus influenzae. In teenagers, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation occurs. Other organisms which can cause infection include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholdia cepacia (which confers a worse prognosis), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, other mycobacteria, Aspergillus fumigatus and viruses. In the UK, antibiotics are usually given when the sputum becomes purulent, pulmonary function deteriorates, or the patient is unwell (e.g. weight loss). In this age groups, Pseudomonal cover is needed and a combination of intravenous antibiotics is used to reduce the risk of resistance developing. The usual combination is ceftazidime and tobramycin, for a period of two weeks. Cefotaxime, augmentin and amoxicillin do not have pseudomonal cover. Gentamicin can be used in place of tobramycin, but has poorer pseudomonal cover and is associated with significant side effects (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity). Sputum samples should be obtained, and organism identification and sensitivities can be used to guide treatment of future exacerbations."
pediatrics,263,"A 2-year-old Afro-Caribbean boy presents with pallor and splenomegaly, discovered incidentally by the family doctor during a consultation for URTI. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations are up to date. Mother has sickle trait. On examination he is apyrexial and well. Conjunctivae are slightly pale. Respiratory rate is 20/min and pulse 95/min. Chest and ENT are clear. The spleen is 3 cm palpable, but is soft and non-tender. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukaemia,"Haemolytic anaemia, acquired",Malaria,Sickle cell anaemia,Thalassaemia,D,The history is of pallor and isolated smooth splenomegaly in a boy of African origin. The likely diagnosis is sickle cell disease. This can be confirmed by haemoglobin electrophoresis.
pediatrics,264,"An 8-year-old boy has longstanding asthma. He has admitted with a severe episode and is tired and drowsy. He has not improved on oxygen, inhaled B2 agonist and IV hydrocortisone. CXR shows bilateral hyperinflation. He is too breathless to use a peakflow meter and is O2 sat <90%. What is the single most appropriate investigation?",CBG (capillary blood gas),CXR,CT chest,Pulse oximetry,Spirometry,A,It will point towards acidosis and indicate whether assisted ventilation is needed or not
pediatrics,265,Echocardiography of an infant at 2 hours of age shows the following cardiac arrangement. The parents would like to know the likely management and if any urgent intervention is required.  Which single answer describes the next most appropriate course of management?,Device closure of the defect,Intravenous diuretics,Pharmacological closure of the defect,Prostaglandin infusion,Transfer to a cardiac centre for surgery,D,"In transposition of the great arteries the aorta is connected to the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery to the left. It is a duct dependant lesion and results in severe cyanosis on ductal closure. The cardiac arrangement shows transposition with a patent ductus arteriosis and small ventricular septal defect. Prostaglandin is used to prevent ductal closure and preserve mixture at the ductal level. Transposition of the great arteries may be diagnosed antenatally and delivery in a cardiac centre is recommended. Undiagnosed transposition may present as severe cyanosis and cardiovascular collapse in the first day of life. A concurrent atrial septal defect or ventricular septal defect can allow mixture of right and left blood. In the absence of adequate mixture an urgent atrial septostomy may be required prior to definitive repair, both necessitating transfer to a cardiac centre. Definitive repair entails an arterial switch, reconnecting the aorta to the left ventricle and pulmonary artery to the right, usually before 2 weeks of age. A patent ductus arteriosus is a normal finding in a preterm infant. A persistent or symptomatic patent duct can be closed either pharmacologically, or rarely surgically. Device closure is most commonly used to close atrial septal defects."
pediatrics,266,"A 10-year-old girl presents with progressive difficulty in walking and using her arms, this has got progressively worse over the past four weeks. She is finding it particularly difficult to climb stairs and get out of a chair unaided. This is associated with a scaly erythematous rash over her shoulders and upper back. She has a brother who has eczema and another who suffers from asthma, in addition to an uncle recently diagnosed with myasthenia gravis. On examination, the child looks well and alert but she has weakness of the neck and the four limbs, which is more marked proximally. Eczema-like skin rashes are noted on the shoulders, upper back and the extensor surfaces of the elbows and knees but she does not mention any itchiness. What is the next step in the management plan?",CSF analysis,Muscle biopsy,Pulmonary function tests,Serum creatinine kinase,Tensilon tests,D,"Juvenile dermatomyositis is a systemic, autoimmune inflammatory muscle disorder. The main presenting features are muscular weakness and skin rashes. In rare cases, only skin rashes are the presenting feature. Risk factors evident in this case are female gender and genetic predisposition (haplotype related). Among the choices, serum creatinine kinase, muscle biopsy and pulmonary function tests are of value in diagnosing and managing juvenile dermatomyositis. Serum creatinine kinase is the simplest and most readily available test with good sensitivity profile. Nevertheless, it can be negative in active disease where other tests are needed. Muscle biopsy is not essential for diagnosis especially in the juvenile form of dermatomyositis, but can give valuable diagnostic information if performed. In some cases of dermatomyositis there is lung restriction when a pulmonary function test is performed, but this is case dependent. Tensilon test is performed for myasthenia gravis. CSF analysis can help in diagnosing Guillain-Barré syndrome. "
pediatrics,267,"A 12-year-old girl with known diabetes presents to accident and emergency with a history of recurrent vomiting and abdominal pain. Clinical examination revealed signs of severe dehydration and deep breathing. Bedside glucose test reveals a value of 17.2 mmol/L. She has received a bolus of normal saline 20 mL/kg over 20 minutes, and now she is receiving the second dose because she is still dehydrated. Her condition started to improve, but after one hour she started to complain of drowsiness and headache. Vital signs monitor showed a heart rate of 49 beats/minute and a blood pressure of 105/90 mmHg. What is the next step in the management plan?",Change the IV fluid to dextrose 4% +0.18 normal saline,CT scan,Mannitol infusion,Slower IV fluid rate,Start insulin infusion immediately,C,"This is a classic case of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This diagnosis is supported by the high glucose readings. Blood with hyperglycaemia is hyperosmolar, and correcting this rapidly will lead to cerebral oedema. DKA should be treated first with a bolus of 10-20 mL/kg of normal saline over one hour, not faster, to rehydrate and minimise the risk of cerebral oedema. In this patient, there was a rapid rehydration leading to cerebral oedema. CT scan would show signs of cerebral oedema but the diagnosis is almost certain and is supported by the clinical signs and history of rapid rehydration. Additionally, a CT scan would need a long time to be arranged. Therefore, mannitol should be started. In addition, mechanical ventilation should be considered. Slower IV fluid rate will not reverse cerebral oedema and changing the IV fluid to hypotonic will make the condition worse."
pediatrics,268,A 16-year-old female presents with ankle swelling four days after having had a sore throat. On examination she had a blood pressure of 125/80 mmHg and ankle oedema. Investigations reveal:    Creatinine 90 µmol/L (60-110)   Albumin 25 g/L (37-49)   24 hour urinary protein 9 g (less than0.2)    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Idiopathic membranous nephropathy,IgA nephropathy,Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis,Minimal change nephropathy,Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis,B,"Idiopathic membranous nephropathy accounts for 2-5% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in children, and 20-30% of cases in adults. The immune mechanism that leads to the development of membranous nephropathy is unknown. Histologically, it is characterised by diffuse thickening of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) on light microscopy. On immunofluorescence, the thickening is caused by immune deposits of IgG and C3, on the subepithelial surface of the GBM. When not idiopathic, it is associated with:  AI diseases - SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease drugs - gold, penicillamine, captopril malignancy - bronchus, breast, stomach, colon, prostate infections - hep B, syphilis, leprosy, filariasis, and diabetes mellitus.  Membranoproliferative (or mesangiocapillary) glomerulonephritis can be classed into three types (I, II, and III) depending on which complement pathway is activated. It is associated with SLE, cryoglobulinaemia with or without hep C, chronic infections (SBE) or with neoplasms. It is not associated acutely with upper respiratory tract infections. Minimal change nephropathy is the most common form of nephrotic syndrome in children (peak incidence 2-3 years of age). The histological findings on light microscopy are normal or small looking glomeruli. On electron microscopy there is effacement of the epithelial cell foot processes over the outer surface of the GBM. It tends to be steroid responsive in children, but over 60% of children will have further relapses. In adults, it is associated with Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other carcinomas. Post streptococcal GN, as the name implies, occurs 10-14 days after an acute infection. The typical case occurs following infection with group A Lancefield streptococci (β-haemolytic strep, S. pyogenes) either causing pharyngitis or skin infections. It is more common in the developing world. The histology shows diffuse proliferative GN, with infiltration by neutrophil polymorphs. The main treatment is eradication of the infection (10/7 course of penicillin) and symptomatic relief of the acute nephritis. The need for dialysis is uncommon, and complete recovery of renal function should occur. The correct answer is IgA nephritis, in this case presenting with nephrotic syndrome. IgA nephritis is most common during the second and third decade of life. It commonly occurs within two days of an onset of an upper respiratory tract infection, or less commonly infection of other mucous membranes (e.g. GI, bladder, breast). It should be diagnosed by a renal biopsy, where IgA is seen deposited in the mesangium. The treatment of IgA nephritis is variable. In a patient with haematuria only, the treatment is conservative. When there is nephrotic range proteinuria (greater than3 g/day - as in this case) an 8-12 week course of prednisolone should be prescribed. If the proteinuria is less than3 g/day an ACE inhibitor can be used. In all patients, careful control of blood pressure should be achieved, by using ACE inhibitors in the first instance, and regular follow up of renal function and urinalysis. 30% of children will have a spontaneous remission within 10 years, but 25% will go on to develop ESRF within 20 years."

pediatrics,272,A 10-year-old boy presents with this lesion (shown) for the past three months. It is asymptomatic.  What is the etiological cause?,Bartonella henselae,Herpes simplex virus,Human papilloma virus,Molluscum contagiosum virus,Trichophyton verrucosum,C,"The patient has a viral wart, caused by the human papilloma virus. Bartonella henselae causes bacillary angiomatosis. Molluscum contagiosum virus is poxvirus that causes another common cutaneous infection, molluscum contagiosum. Herpes simplex virus causes herpetic infections, for example, herpes labialis, herpes genitalis, herpetic whitlow. Trichophyton verrucosum is a dermatophyte which causes tinea."
pediatrics,273,"A 7-year-old boy presents to the Emergency department having been bitten by a dog. The animal has no known diseases. The boy had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. On examination he is distressed, but apyrexial. He has several penetrating teeth marks on the left arm, which is swollen and tender. Otherwise he is well. Other than analgesia, what should your first action be in this boy's management?",Clean wound,Give tetanus booster,Give anaesthetic,Give antibiotics,Surgical opinion,A,"Animal bites are fairly common. Injuries vary considerably in extent. Careful wound cleaning is needed first, and confirmation of the tetanus status. If, as in this case, immunisation is complete, then there is no need for a booster dose. Oral co-amoxiclav covers the common organisms. Dog bites are less likely to become infected than cat bites, where there is also a risk of cat scratch disease. A surgical opinion should be sought if the injuries are extensive. "
pediatrics,274,"A 2-month-old boy is referred with abdominal mass. This has been found at the routine 6 week surveillance review. He was born at term weighing 3.7 kg, and the parents were first cousins. On examination he has low-set ears, frontal bossing, a depressed nasal bridge and long philtrum. He has 4 cm hepatomegaly and 3 cm splenomegaly. He has poor head control. Although he smiled at 6 weeks he has not made further developmental progress. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hunter syndrome,Hurler syndrome,Gangliosidosis,San Filippo syndrome,Zellweger syndrome,C,"The consanguinity, dysmorphic features, hepatosplenomegaly and developmental arrest suggest a storage disease. These include lipidoses, mucopolysaccharidoses and glycogenoses. In this case the features are most characteristic of infantile GM1 Gangliosidosis, 50% of whom have a macular cherry red spot."
pediatrics,275,A 15-year-old girl presents with nasal obstruction and slight watery discharge. This occurs particularly in smoky atmospheres or in the cold. Otherwise she is completely well. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. She has no inflammation of the eyes nor sneezing. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination she is apyrexial and has bilateral nasal obstruction with clear discharge. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Allergic rhinitis,Nasal foreign body,Sinusitis,Vasomotor rhinitis,Viral URI,D,"The history is of nasal obstruction triggered by environmental changes. There are no allergic symptoms, like sneezing or eye itching. The likely diagnosis is therefore vasomotor rhinitis."
pediatrics,276,"A 6-months-old boy is admitted with persistent irritability. He is lethargic and is not feeding as well as usual. His RR (respirarory rate) is 30 bpm, saturation 97%, temperature 38.0C, capillary refill time 2 seconds. Urine reveals leucocytes on dipstick. What is the single investigation most likely to lead to diagnosis?",Blood for C&S,ESR,CXR,Urine for C&S,CSF analysis,D,Dipstick test if show leucocytes or nitrites is suggestive of UTI. So to confirm it we should do urine C&S
pediatrics,277,"A 2-year-old girl presents with coryza and splenomegaly. She has been unwell for 13 days and her cold has been slow to clear. She has been off colour for about four weeks, but there is no other history of note. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a fever to 37.7°C, with respiratory rate 16/min, and pulse 95/min. She looks unwell and conjunctivae are pale. Her chest and ears are clear. She has 4 cm firm smooth splenomegaly. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukaemia,Gaucher's disease,"Haemolytic anaemia, acquired",Hodgkin lymphoma,Infectious mononucleosis,A,"The history is of non-specific unwellness for four weeks, a cold that clears slowly, in an unwell child with pallor and firm splenomegaly. This suggests a rapidly progressive systemic illness. The most likely diagnosis is a malignancy, with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) causing marrow infiltration and immunosuppression being the most likely. An full blood count (FBC) and film will usually clinch the diagnosis. "
pediatrics,278,A neonate does not pass meconium for 48 hours after birth. A fortnight later his mother states that he is not passing stools regularly. He has been bottle fed since discharge. Investigations reveal massive dilatation of the colon proximal to the rectum and manometry shows increased internal anal pressure on rectal distension with a balloon. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cows' milk allergy,Cystic fibrosis,Hirschsprung's disease,Hypothyroidism,Idiopathic constipation,C,"The child has Hirschsprung's disease, characterised by the early constipation and radiology. The disorder is due to an absence of the ganglion cells in the wall of the colon. Treatment is through resection of the atonic segment."
pediatrics,279,"A 3-week-old girl on the neonatal unit is noted to have a fever and decreased spontaneous movement. She was born at 26/40 gestation weighing 1.02 kg. After a stormy course she has returned from the neonatal intensive care for convalescence. She is unimmunised. There is no family and social history of note. She has multiple venepuncture sites, and has redness over a site over the dorsum of the right foot and over the shin, which is swollen. She cries when this area is touched. She has a fever of 37.6°C, and lies still in her cot. Respiratory rate is 30/min, heart rate 100/min. She is well perfused. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cellulitis,Osteomyelitis,Osteosarcoma,Sarcoidosis,Septic Arthritis,B,"The history is of low grade fever with pseudoparalysis of the right leg and tibial inflammation. This suggests an osteomyelitis in the right tibia complicating a previous infected drip site in the foot. The infected drip site and the degree of extension of redness suggests this is more serious than simple cellulitis. Ultrasound scan, x ray, bone scan and blood cultures should be performed and intravenous antibiotics given to cover Staph. aureus, Group B Streptococcus and Gram negative organisms."
pediatrics,280,"A 5-year-old boy presents with recurrent ear pain and fever. Every time he gets a cold he develops ear pain and receives antibiotics from the GP. He has about six episodes a year. He was born at term weighing 2.9 kg and there were no neonatal problems. He is fully immunised. His parents are both smokers. On examination he has a temperature of 38.0°C, respiratory rate of 15/min and pulse of 90/min. He has shotty slightly tender cervical nodes. His left eardrum is red and bulging. Throat examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Group A streptococcal pharyngitis,Mastoiditis,Otitis media with effusion,"Otitis media, acute","Otitis media, recurrent",E,"The history suggests recurrent episodes of acute otitis media with each upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). If these are progressively causing damage (for example, eardrum scarring) prophylactic antibiotics (e.g. with trimethoprim) and investigations for minor immune deficiency may be considered. Most improve with age."
pediatrics,281,"A 6 weeks child has history of frequent vomiting which became worse during the last weeks. He has no fever, recently he has passed stool only once every 2-3 days.

DTaP, IPV, and Hib (the 5-in-1) is given at 2, 3, and 4 months. Rotavirus is given at 2 and 3 months, and meningitis C only at 3 months. "
pediatrics,283,A 14-year-old girl collapses after taking an overdose of her father's gliclazide tablets. On admission to the emergency department her glucose is measured at 1.4 mmol/l. She is unconscious. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?,IV 5% dextrose,IV 10% dextrose,IV 50% dextrose,IV glucagon,IV octreotide,B,"The answer is IV 10% dextrose. Ten per cent dextrose contains sufficient carbohydrate to reverse hypoglycaemia, and is not as damaging to peripheral veins as 50% dextrose is. As such it is the method of choice for glucose replacement in this case. Five per cent dextrose does not deliver sufficient carbohydrate, and 50% dextrose is very damaging to veins and should be avoided if possible.  IV glucagon is an option as an adjunct to therapy, and octreotide can help resolve hypoglycaemia if the response to IV dextrose is poor."
pediatrics,284,A 6-year-old boy's behaviour had deteriorated over the previous four months.His mother complained that his mood was very labile at home and his school had been concerned about his poor concentration. She thought he appeared more tired than usual.  His eczema was well controlled. His mother also noticed he had been chesty for six months and coughed after exercise. Neurological examination was normal. What would you consider to be the most appropriate next step in his management?,Allergen testing,Full blood count,Refer to behavioural psychologist,Refer to social worker,Trial of salbutamol at night,E,This child had undiagnosed asthma.  He was coughing at night which disturbed his sleep. As a result his behaviour had deteriorated during the day. On follow up in clinic his behaviour and concentration were much improved.
pediatrics,285,"You are called to see a 6-year-old boy who presented to the Emergency department with a generalised tonic-clonic convulsion. He has already been given one dose of buccal midazolam by his father ten minutes ago. The father also states that his son has had a fever for more than one day. The child is still seizing, airway is secured, high flow oxygen is administered and the IV line is established. What is the next step in the management plan?",Check blood glucose,Give one dose of IV lorazepam,Give one suppository of diclofenac sodium rectally,Take an urgent arterial blood gas sample,Transfer to ICU,A,"Seizures are one of the most common paediatric presentations to the emergency room in the United Kingdom. NICE has developed guidelines on the diagnosis and management of the epilepsies in primary and secondary care to ensure that the best treatment is given to the child in a timely and systematic manner. Although all of the answer options can be considered in the management plan at some point, the most important steps are to check ABC, administer oxygen and check blood glucose. Hypoglycaemia can induce an epileptic attack or can be induced by the epileptic attack, creating a vicious circle. IV lorazepam is the anti-epileptic drug of choice if the blood glucose is normal. The timing is appropriate as buccal midazolam was given ten minutes ago without improvement. Giving one suppository of diclofenac sodium rectally can be considered an attempt to reduce temperature which will minimise metabolic demand. However, this step can be delayed until the patient is stabilised. Transferring the patient to ICU can be considered only after the patient is seizure free. "
pediatrics,286,"A 4-year-old girl develops a fever 14 days after returning from a family visit to India. At the height of fever she feels shivery and cold. She has previously been well. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a fever to 39.8°C, Respiratory rate 20/min and pulse 100/min. Chest and ENT examinations are normal. She is shivering violently. She has 3 cm spleen, which is smooth and non-tender. What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Kala-azar,Malaria,Schistosomiasis,D,"The history of fever, rigors and splenomegaly in a child returning from an endemic area suggests malaria. Thick and thin blood smears should be taken. Malarial resistance is an increasing problem, and the latest information should be obtained about the area of disease acquisition to ensure proper treatment. Kala-azar has a more gradual onset, with initial infection being asymptomatic or mild. Later there is low grade fever and hepatomegaly. Later there is resolution or progression to chronic disease with low grade fever and hepatosplenomegaly. "
pediatrics,287,"A 7-year-old boy presents with swelling under his arm. He was well until seven days before, when he developed mild fever and malaise. He had a full term normal delivery and no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family history of note. The family have a cat. On examination the temperature is 37.9°C. He has a 3 cm smooth enlargement of a node in the right axilla. This is slightly red but not fluctuant. Otherwise there are no abnormalities to find. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cat scratch disease,Hodgkin lymphoma,Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Mycobacterial adenitis,A,"The history suggests subacute regional gland enlargement due to inflammation. The most likely diagnosis is cat scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae. The incubation period is 3-30 days and often small erythematous lesions can be found along the scratch marks. Regional adenopathy develops after one to four weeks."
pediatrics,288,In ventricular septal defect (VSD) which of the following is true?,Left to right shunting leads to increased risk of cerebral abscess,The smallest defects tend to produce the softest murmurs,The systolic murmur increases in intensity as pulmonary hypertension develops,There is no risk of bacterial endocarditis,There may be a diastolic murmur at the apex,E,"Diastolic murmur occurs due to aortic incompetence (5%) or increased flow across the mitral valve and relative mitral stenosis. Right to left shunting causes cerebral abscesses. Large defects may be associated with soft murmurs. Although pulmonary hypertension may occur in association with increased flow across the shunt, it may indicate decreased flow across the shunt and increased pulmonary vascular resistance, in which case the murmur would be softer. The risk of bacterial endocarditis is high in this lesion and even greater with haemodynamically trivial lesions."
pediatrics,289,Nifedipine is a non-competitive inhibitor of CYP2C9. Which of the following correctly reflects the definition of a non-competitive inhibitor?,Binds to a different site from the active site but does not prevent binding of other compounds to the active site,Binds to a different site from the active site but only has some of the activity of other compounds,Binds to the active site and prevents other compounds binding to the active site,Binds to the active site but does not prevent binding of other compounds to the active site,Binds to the active site but only has some of the activity of other compounds,A,"The answer is it binds to a different site from the active site but does not prevent binding of other compounds to the active site. This is the definition of a non-competitive inhibitor; non-competitive inhibitors can down-regulate enzyme activity so that even full agonists binding at the active site do not exert full activity. Inhibitors which bind to the active site are known as competitive inhibitors. Compounds which bind to the active site but only have partial activity are known as partial agonists. An example of a partial agonist is salmeterol, which is long acting but only has partial activity versus salbutamol."
pediatrics,290,A 17-year-old male with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency presents with tiredness and is noticed to be jaundiced. These features have developed since he developed a mild chest infection one week ago. Which one of the following is the most likely finding?,Haemoglobinuria,Low mean cell volume,Positive direct antiglobulin test,Reduced reticulocyte count,Spherocytes present on blood film,A,"G6PD deficiency is a red cell enzymopathy that can lead to acute intravascular haemolysis after exposure to certain drugs, infection etc. You would therefore get haemoglobinuria but would not get a positive direct antiglobulin test. The MCV and reticulocyte count would be high due to haemolysis. There is a form of G6PD deficiency where there is a chronic low level haemolysis, where there are spherocytes seen, but the clinical information points to intravascular haemolysis after an infection."
pediatrics,291,A baby is diagnosed with a ventricular septal defect. Which one of the following is true concerning a VSD?,Causes 'fixed splitting' of the second heart sound,Is associated with plethoric lung fields on chest x ray in a 10-week-old infant,Is likely to cause heart failure in the first week of life,Requires surgical correction if central cyanosis occurs,Requires surgical correction in all but a small minority of cases,B,"VSD is unlikely to present until after the first month of life and is associated with pulmonary plethora. The majority of cases will resolve spontaneously. Central cyanosis indicates shunt reversal and pulmonary hypertension, which implies poor prognosis and response to operative repair of the VSD. The second heart sound is normally split. 'Splitting' refers to separation of the aortic (A2) and pulmonary (P2) components of the second heart sound (S2). 'Normal/physiological' splitting occurs in inspiration only, when P2 is after A2. During expiration there is no splitting and only a single S2 is heard. 'Fixed splitting' is a feature of an atrial septal defect (ASD), not a VSD. This is when P2 is delayed (and after A2) during BOTH inspiration and expiration. 'Reversed splitting' occurs in severe aortic stenosis and that is when A2 occurs after P2."
pediatrics,292,An 8-year-old boy is referred by his GP with an eight week history of a painless swelling over the angle of the left jaw. It had rapidly increased in size over the last two weeks. His height and weight are on the 50th centile. He has a left sided facial weakness. His left eye is medially deviated and he cannot look laterally to the left. Ocular movements are normal in the right eye.  What is the most appropriate investigation from the list below?,Electron microscopy on saliva for mumps,MRI head andamp; neck,Mumps IgM level,Sialogram,Ultrasound parotid gland,B,"Due to involvement of both sixth and seventh cranial nerves, the lesion has extended past the parotid. MRI is the investigation of choice here. Diagnosis was rhabdomyosarcoma with intracranial extension."
pediatrics,293,A 13-year-old boy is brought to clinic by his parents concerned about his weight. Which of the following is true of childhood obesity?,It can lead to overestimation of the dose of intravenous fluids when these are required,It is defined as a body mass index above 28 kg/m^2,It is more common in families in Social Class I than in Social Class V,It is unlikely to lead to adult obesity,It is usually associated with hypogonadism,A,"Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) over the 98th centile on the appropriate growth chart.  Although hypogonadism may be feature of disorders such as Prader-Willi syndrome, hypothalamic pituitary testicular function is usually unimpaired in childhood obesity. Obese children frequently go on to become obese adults with increased prevalence amongst the lower social classes. It may lead to over-estimation of the dose of an intravenous drug as the doses are based on body weight assuming a substantial proportion of that is lean tissue (hydrous) as opposed to fat (anhydrous). As a consequence the metabolic activity of the fat tissue above average height before puberty is a feature."
pediatrics,294,A 4 weeks girl has been diagnosed of having breast milk jaundice. She is otherwise well. What is the single most appropriate management?,Continue breastfeeding,Exchange transfusion,Increase fluid intake,Phototherapy,Stop breastfeeding,A,"If jaundice lasts past the first week of life in a breastfed baby who is otherwise healthy, the condition may be called ""breast milk jaundice.” This is predominantly unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Cause may be actors in a mother's milk that help a baby absorb bilirubin from the intestine"
pediatrics,295,A 17-year-old student returns from a backpacking trip to Nepal with a two week history of offensive diarrhoea and weight loss. What is the most likely infective organism?,Escherichia coli 0157,Giardia intestinalis (G.lamblia),Salmonella typhi,Shigella flexneri,Yersinia enterocolitica,B,"The history of diarrhoea over a couple of weeks makes giardiasis the most likely diagnosis here. Giardia lamblia is a protozoan which can cause traveller's diarrhoea. It is transmitted by cysts from faecally contaminated water or between people. The incubation period is three days to three weeks and the symptoms can persist for several weeks. Diarrhoea tends to be the presenting symptom and classically has a highly offensive smell. This is often followed by nausea, cramps, abdominal pain and bloating. The diarrhoea can become persistent and lead to malabsorption and weight loss. Unlike other infective causes of chronic diarrhoea, Giardia readily affects immunocompetent hosts as well as the immunocompromised. Giardia is diagnosed by visualising cysts in stool or trophozoites in small bowel mucosal biopsy. It is treated with tinidazole (2 g single dose), or metronidazole (3-10 days). Metronidazole has been shown to cure over 90% of patients, and is often better tolerated than tinidazole. Paromomycin can be used in pregnancy as there is no systemic absorption. Resistant infection can often be cured with a combination of metronidazole and quinacrine. Escherichia coli 0157 is a rare cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It usually causes bloody diarrhoea which lasts less than a week. It can be complicated by haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Shigella and Yersinia also usually cause dysentery. Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever which typically presents as a systemic illness with intermittent diarrhoea. "
pediatrics,296,"A 37/40 infant is born weighing 1.7 kg with Apgars of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. Pregnancy was complicated by poor weight gain in mother.

On examination the temperature is 36.5°C, and the child is self-ventilating in air with saturations of 94%. Birth weight and OFC are both well below the 3%. The child has a few 1-2 mm purple spots over the trunk, and has 3 cm of liver and 4 cm of spleen palpable. What is the most likely organism?",Cytomegalovirus,Herpes simplex,Rubella,Toxoplasma gondii,Treponema pallidum,A,"The history is of symmetrical intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) suggesting a process starting early in pregnancy. The major two aetiologies to consider are:  Intrinsic abnormalities (e.g. chromosomal or multiple malformation syndrome), or Congenital toxin or infection.  The latter is suggested by the petechiae and hepatosplenomegaly. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most likely cause."
pediatrics,297,A 11-year-old girl presents to the haematology clinic with pancytopenia. On examination she is short and looks dysmorphic with unusual looking forearms. What is the normal mode of inheritance for this condition?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Sporadic,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,B,The question describes a typical patient with Fanconi anaemia. It is usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait and is the result of a defect in a DNA repair gene. It is associated with  Absent radii Multiple dysmorphic features Short stature Kidney problems.  Ninety per cent develop bone marrow failure and approximately 1/3 develop acute myeloid leukaemia. Bone marrow transplant is the only long term treatment option.

pediatrics,299,"A 14-year-old boy is referred to outpatient clinic for pubertal delay and attends with his mother. He has raised FSH/LH levels. On examination he is tall and slim with small testes, mild gynaecomastia and a long arm span. His mother reports that he has an autism spectrum disorder. Which of the following conditions is he most likely to have?",Bardet-Biedl syndrome,Kallmann syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Prader-Willi syndrome,Turner syndrome,C,"All the answer options are syndromes associated with delayed puberty. Klinefelter's is an example of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism where LH and FSH would be raised. The differential diagnosis of hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism includes: Congenital:  Gonadal dysgenesis Klinefelter's syndrome Turner syndrome Androgen resistance (receptor defects) Steroidogenic enzyme defects  Acquired:  Cryptorchidism Radiation or chemotherapy Trauma/surgery Autoimmune or post- infectious (mumps, coxsackie)  Klinefelter syndrome:  47 XXY is most common genotype, sporadic Tall and slim, with increased leg and arm length Cryptorchidism, small firm testes and decreased sperm count Gynaecomastia Learning difficulties and immature behaviour Azoospermia and infertility.  Kallmann syndrome is an association of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with anosmia. LH/FSH would be low. Bardet-Biedl is the association of retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, polydactyly, mental retardation, hypogonadism. The question states that he is slim. LH/FSH would also be low. Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with obesity and insatiable appetite, emotional lability and hypogonadism (micropenis, hypoplastic scotum, cryptorchidism). Again, the question states that he is slim, therefore this is not the correct answer. LH/FSH would also be low. Turner syndrome genotype is XO, therefore it only affects females."
pediatrics,300,A 6-month-old boy presents with diarrhoea and vomiting. On examination he appears moderately dehydrated. A tentative diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis is made. Which of the following is correct when managing a moderately dehydrated baby?,He is more likely to have hypernatraemia than hyponatraemia,He will have a fluid deficit of about 10 ml per kilogram,He will have loss of skin turgor,"If breast-fed, he should have oral feeding stopped","If formula-fed, he will require lactose-free milk on commencing oral feeding",C,"A moderately dehydrated baby has a loss of 6-9% of body weight and a fluid deficit of around 100 ml/kg. Breast feeding should be continued and supplement oral feeds may be required to maintain adequate volumes. Formula fed infants should not have their formula changed and milk feeding should not be discontinued. Hyponatraemia or a normal serum sodium is more likely to be present than hypernatraemia. Decreased skin tone and tissue turgor will be present, also oliguria, dry mucous membranes and sunken fontanelle."

pediatrics,302,A 2-month-old girl presents with mild cough and wheeze and is diagnosed with bronchiolitis. The mother is concerned that her daughter might develop asthma too and is asking for advice to minimise the risk of developing asthma knowing that the family have a cat. What advice can you give the mother?,An extra flu vaccine should be considered annually,"Measures should be taken to minimise dust mite exposure, such as regular washing of linen and removing all carpets",They should get rid of the cat,The mother should be encouraged to continue to breastfeed,Prescribe fish oils that have a high level of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids,D,"Asthma is a very common disease in the UK. Extensive research and guidelines were developed to minimise prevalence (primary prevention) and morbidities (secondary prevention). Breast feeding should be encouraged for its many benefits, including a potential protective effect in relation to early asthma. All childhood immunisations should proceed normally as there is no evidence of an adverse effect on the incidence of asthma. Healthcare professionals should not recommend house dust mite aeroallergen avoidance for the primary prevention of asthma, although it is of value in secondary prevention. Neither should healthcare professionals offer advice on pet ownership as a strategy for preventing childhood asthma. In the absence of any evidence of benefit from the use of fish oil supplementation in pregnancy it is not possible to recommend it as a strategy for preventing childhood asthma. "
pediatrics,303,"A 9-year-old girl presents with fever, frontal headache, focal convulsion (later generalised) and decreased level of consciousness. She was well until 48 hours before when she had become febrile. The generalised convulsion had begun 20 minutes previously. She has no previous history of note. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a temperature of 38.7°C, and responds only to pain. Respiratory rate is 12/min and chest clinically clear. Heart rate is 100/min. Abdominal examination is normal. After the fit is terminated by PR diazepam she appears to have a right focal weakness. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial meningitis,Cerebral abscess,Electrolyte disturbance,Herpes encephalitis,Idiopathic epilepsy,D,"The history suggests an acute infective process causing coma, focal convulsion and focal weakness. The likely diagnosis is an encephalopathy, which can be viral meningoencephalitis or bacterial meningitis. The picture is more suggestive of the former, and the focal nature and degree of illness make herpes a prime candidate. Initial management includes:  securing the airway and giving O2 IV access and blood glucose, with correction of hypoglycaemia.  CT scan of head may be helpful (for example, temporal involvement in herpes encephalitis), with lumbar puncture (LP) when safe to do so for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for bacteria and viruses. Initial treatment will be broad-spectrum antibiotics and aciclovir (+/- erythromycin to cover Mycoplasma). Cerebral abscess is usually associated with a risk factor, such as cyanotic congenital heart disease, meningitis, mastoiditis, orbital cellulitis, dental abscess, immunodeficiency, VP shunt, or penetrating injury.

pediatrics,304,"A 14-year-old girl presents to her health care provider informing him that she has missed two periods and that she has a pregnancy test confirming that she is pregnant. She has a boyfriend who is 15 and has been having protected sex with condoms for six months. She wants a termination but does not want to involve her parents at all. She is counselled regarding abortion and what it entails and is also asked to involve her parents, but she flatly refuses, indicating that she will otherwise get an abortion elsewhere. She understands the risks of having an abortion. What is the most appropriate action for this patient?",Contact her parents and inform them of the situation,Inform her that she can only have an abortion with parental consent,Offer her a referral to an abortion service without parental consent,Offer her referral for an abortion only if she informs her parents,Refer to social services,C,"Under the Gillick case, if a child is competent and has an understanding of the full implications of her actions then she can be offered advice and treatment without parental consent. Thus, in these circumstances, the most appropriate option is to offer an abortion with appropriate counselling and support if the patient requests. If, on grounds of conscientious objection, you decide that you cannot participate in abortion then you must provide an alternative practitioner who will support the patient. Every effort should be made to persuade her to inform her parents."
pediatrics,305,A 3-month-old boy presents with a 3 cm haemangioma behind the right ear. Which is the best advice to give the parents?,He should be referred to the plastic surgeons for surgical removal,He should receive 2 mg/kg of prednisolone for 4 months to shrink it down,He should receive alpha interferon injections,He should receive intralesional triamcinolone injections,"It is likely to enlarge to about a year of age, then disappear over the next 5-8 years",E,"These lesions usually regress spontaneously.

pediatrics,307,"A 39+5/40 gestation infant is born weighing 3.96 kg by elective caesarian section (previous section) under spinal anaesthesia. She is born in good condition with Apgars of 9 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. She begins grunting from birth, and after transfer to the neonatal unit requires 25% oxygen to maintain saturations of 94%. On examination she is apyrexial, well and well perfused. Her respiratory distress and grunting resolve over the next 12 hours, and she is out of oxygen by the next morning. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Congenital pneumonia,Meconium aspiration,Surfactant-deficient lung disease,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,E,"The history is of caesarian section delivery and transient respiratory distress with low O2 requirements, which resolves within the first 12-24 hours of birth. This is characteristic of transient tachypnoea of the newborn, which is caused by retained lung fluid. It often occurs in preterm or term vaginal delivery and caesarian section delivery. It is due to slow absorption of fetal lung fluid."

Choose the single most likely investigation?",Upper GI endoscopy,Barium meal,US,CT abdomen,Barium enema,C,Palpable mass in the abdomen “ON FEEDING” (just after feeding the mass becomes more prominent and can be palpated more easily) is suggestive of pyloric stenosis. US is used to diagnose this
pediatrics,309,"Regarding the treatment of asthma in children, which response is correct?",If a child is prescribed steroids for more than three days they should be prescribed a weaning regime,Long term use of salbutamol reduces its effectiveness,Montelukast works by the same mode as salbutamol,Most children over 6 years can use a peak flow meter,Peak flow meter should be thoroughly cleaned in the dishwasher after each use,D,"A peak flow meter should be regularly used to alert a patient to any change in their condition. Children as young as 3 can be encouraged to try and learn how to use them but sometimes get confused with the inhalation required for their inhaler and exhalation for peak flow meter. By the age of 6 years most children can comfortably co-ordinate both actions. According to NICE guidelines, weaning of a course of steroids is unnecessary, unless the course exceeds 14 days. There is no evidence that regular use of salbutamol reduces its effectiveness, although regular preventer therapy should be added if salbutamol is frequently required. Montelukast and salbutamol have different modes of action. Montelukast is a leukotriene receptor antagonist, blocking the action of leukotriene D4 in lungs and bronchial tree so reducing bronchoconstriction, whereas salbutamol is a beta-2 agonist, acting on airway smooth muscle to reduce bronchospasm. A peak flow meter is designed to be single patient use, so cleaning once a week should be enough. Most are dishwasher safe, but this should be confirmed before trying."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital toxoplasmosis,Hepatic failure,Late vitamin K deficiency,Reye syndrome,Shaken baby syndrome,E,"The history suggests a previously healthy child with colic and inexperienced parents. The facial bruising suggests grip marks. Given the full fontanelle, comatose state of the child, and flame-shaped haemorrhages, shaken baby syndrome is most likely. It is important to exclude infection with disseminated intravascular coagulation or a coagulopathy."

All of the choices can cause secondary amenorrhoea. However, there are two clinical signs indicating self-induced vomiting: dental erosions caused by the acidic gastric content, and the scratches over the dorsum of the hand (Russell's sign) caused by the friction against teeth while inserting fingers to induce vomiting. This is further supported by the blood tests that show hypokalaemic alkalosis. Anorexia nervosa is characterised by severe weight loss, while patients with polycystic ovary syndrome tend to have a higher BMI, in addition to other symptoms such as hirsutism. Patients with Cushing's syndrome may have similar blood investigations but with different clinical presentation. "

pediatrics,323,A 17-year-old girl has only recently passed her driving test. She visits her GP very upset as she has just had a seizure whilst she was asleep. Which would be the best single piece of advice to give her regarding driving regulations?,"If you have an 'asleep' seizure you must stop driving. If you are either seizure-free for one year or only have 'asleep' seizures for three years, you can then apply for a new licence.",If you have an 'asleep' seizure you must stop driving. If you are seizure-free during the day and only have 'asleep seizures' for one year you can then apply for a new licence.,If you have an 'asleep' seizure you must stop driving. If you are seizure-free for one year without taking anti-epileptic medication you can then apply for a new licence.,"If you have only had a seizure when you are asleep you are allowed to continue driving, but if you then have a seizure whilst awake you must inform the DVLA.",The rules are the same whether you have 'awake' seizures or 'asleep' seizures.,A,"If you have a driving licence and have a seizure of any kind, the DVLA regulations say that you must stop driving. You are responsible for telling the DVLA and returning your licence to them. 'Asleep seizures' are seizures that happen while you are sleeping (sometimes called 'nocturnal seizures'). They can happen if you sleep in the daytime, not just at night. If you have an asleep seizure, you must stop driving. If you are seizure-free for one year, either with or without anti-epileptic medication, you can apply for a new licence. This is the same as the regulations for seizures while you are awake ('awake seizures'). However, if you are not seizure-free but you have only had asleep seizures for three years, the regulations are different from 'awake seizures'. This means that if, in the last three years, your seizures have only happened in your sleep, and none while you are awake, you can drive even if you are still having asleep seizures. It is important that this pattern of only asleep seizures is seen over at least three years. You will still need to tell the DVLA and your insurance company about your seizures. "
pediatrics,324,"A 7-month-old Syrian boy presents with increasing jaundice for 4 days, associated with irritability.

The following results are obtained:    WBC: 12 ×109/L (7-18)   Neutrophils: 8.4×109/L (3-10)   Lymphocytes: 3×109/L (2-8.5)   Hb: 57 g/L (115-155)   Platelets: 182 ×109/L (150-400)   CRP: 15 mg/L (less than5)   ESR: 30 mm/hr (less than13)   Albumin: 31 g/L (30-50)   ALT: 90 units/L (0-40)   AST: 85 units/L (0-40)   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH): 650 iu/L (220-450)   Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT): 120 (0-60)   Bilirubin: 110 μmol /L (less than21)   Unconjugated Bilirubin: 40 μmol/L   Conjugated Bilirubin: 70 μmol/L     Urine analysis showed haemoglobinuria. Which of the following is the most likely primary cause of his symptoms?",Biliary atresia,Haemolytic anaemia,Haemolytic Ureamic Syndrome,Hepatitis,Malaria,B,"G6PD deficiency is an x-linked recessive inherited condition that predisposes the patient to haemolysis after ingesting certain foods. It is highly prevalent in Middle-Eastern and Mediterranean countries. Some cases present early as neonatal jaundice, while other cases present later in childhood as acute haemolysis.  This patient presents with both conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in addition to anaemia. These results can be explained primarily by haemolysis which increases unconjugated bilirubin that is converted to a conjugated form and excreted as bile. Increased bilirubin in bile will predispose to insipissated bile syndrome, which is evident by the elevated unconjugated bilirubin and GGT. G6PD deficiency should be ruled out due to the patient's ethnicity and evidence of haemolysis at the age when other foods other than breast milk are introduced. Other possible differentials are hereditary spherocytosis, auto-immune haemolytic anaemia, and even ABO incompatibility, which are causes of haemolytic anemia. Malaria can cause haemolysis but has a very different presentation that includes fever and lethargy. Hepatitis is one of the differentials but does not explain the increased of unconjugated bilirubin, and liver enzymes are expected to be much higher (3-fold increment). Haemolytic Ureamic Syndrome does not present with insipissated bile syndrome and expected to show thrombocytopenia, while biliary atresia presents in the neonatal period."

pediatrics,327,A 3-day-old neonate is noted by ward staff to have had a seizure. Which of the following statements concerning neonatal convulsions is correct?,A blood glucose level of 1.7 mmol/L in a term infant on day 1 is invariably associated with convulsions or apnoea.,An abnormal EEG indicates a high risk of later developing epilepsy,Convulsions occurring in the first 24 hours in a baby with an Apgar score of 8 at 5 minutes cannot be due to intrapartum asphyxia.,"If phenobarbitone is prescribed daily, estimations of serum bilirubin are needed because of risks of kernicterus.",Maternal narcotic addiction is a well-recognised cause.,E,"Maternal narcotic addiction is associated with a neonatal drug withdrawal syndrome. Convulsions occurring in the first 24 hours may be the result of placental insufficiency and cerebral palsy. Hypoglycaemia may be associated with seizures, but not invariably. Hepatitis and jaundice are rare side effects; CNS depression is more common with phenobarbitone. An abnormal EEG does not correlate with later risk of epilepsy."

pediatrics,329,"A 3-year-old attends clinic with his parents. He is thriving, but they have noted that whenever they give him any milk, cheese or yoghurt his stomach make gurgling noises and then two hours later he develops explosive diarrhoea. This lasts for approximately two days and then resolves. They have now taken to avoiding these foods and have noted a vast improvement, but are worried if this is normal and how they can improve his diet. What is the pathology underlying the diagnosis?",Alteration in intestinal motility,Mutational defects in ion transport proteins,Osmotic diarrhoea,Reduction in anatomical surface area,Secretory diarrhoea,C,"Secretory diarrhoea is classically caused by cholera and E. coli enterotoxins. This child has lactose intolerance due to a deficiency in the lactose enzyme. Lactose should be absorbed in the small intestine, but due to the lack of the enzyme, it passes through to the colon in the same state where bacteria help cause water to be secreted into the colon to cause diarrhoea.  Alteration in intestinal motility is caused by malnutrition, scleroderma and diabetes mellitus. Mutational defects in ion transport proteins exist due to defects in either the sodium-hydrogen or chloride-bicarbonate or sodium-bile acid transport proteins and are congenital defects. Reduction in the anatomical surface area is seen in short bowel syndrome secondary to necrotising enterocolitis, volvulus or intestinal atresia."
pediatrics,330,"A 13-month-old boy presents with poor weight gain, and recurrent episodes of diarrhoea and eczema. He has been given cow's milk since age 11 months. There is a family history of eczema. The following tests have been performed:    Specific IgE cow's milk protein negative   Skin prick test cow's milk protein negative    Which one of the following is the correct diagnosis?",Coeliac disease,Delayed-type hypersensitivity cow's milk protein allergy,IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy,Lactose intolerance,T-cell lymphoma,B,"Non-IgE mediated cow's milk protein allergy (delayed-type hypersensitivity) has relatively non-specific symptoms. It is not IgE mediated and therefore there are no IgE antibodies to cow's milk protein. Coeliac disease is associated with a rash called dermatitis herpetiformis that is distinct from eczema. Delayed-type hypersensitivity cow's milk protein allergy is T-cell mediated and equally as common as IgE-mediated allergy. The symptoms are chronic and often not clearly related in time to milk consumption; this makes diagnosis challenging. Up to 7% of children have cow's milk protein allergy. Diagnosis of non-IgE mediated cow's milk protein allergy can be confirmed by a double-blind food challenge to cow's milk. Treatment is with exclusion of cow's milk from the diet and use of an extensively hydrolysed milk formula. These management considerations also apply to the IgE-mediated form. IgE-mediated cow's milk protein allergy would have elevated specific IgE to cow's milk protein and positive skin prick test for milk. It typically presents with wheeze, itchy rash, vomiting, and diarrhoea soon after milk ingestion. It is mediated by histamine release. A small percentage have life-threatening anaphylaxis and need to be given an epipen. Lactose intolerance is not associated with failure to thrive or eczema. It is very unusual in young children except after gastrointestinal infection. This is not a T-cell lymphoma. This can develop as a complication of coeliac disease; however, this child's presentation is not that of coeliac disease. The four types of autoimmune hypersensitivity reaction can be remembered with the mnemonic ACID:    A IgE-Antibody mediated Anaphylaxis - IgE antibodies on mast cells cause rapid degranulation with histamine release on exposure to antigen   C Cell mediated Cytotoxic, e.g., Goodpastures syndrome   I Immune complex mediated Systemic lupus erythematosus, serum sickness   D Delayed-type hypersensitivity Contact dermatitis, TB skin reaction    "
pediatrics,331,"A 4-day-old male baby is brought to the paediatric acute surgical ward with mild abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, refusing to feed, and failure to pass meconium after birth. Abdominal examination is unremarkable. Plain abdominal x ray reveals dilated loops of bowel with fluid levels. A barium enema demonstrates a 'conical appearance' in the distal segment of the colon. The parents have been informed that the baby requires a rectal biopsy. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anal atresia,Hirschsprung's disease,Intestinal atresia,Meconium ileus,Necrotising enterocolitis,B,"Hirschsprung's disease is the absence of ganglion cells (congenital aganglionosis) in the neural plexus of the intestinal wall. The disease begins with the anus, which is always involved, and continues proximally for a variable distance. Both the myenteric (Auerbach) and submucosal (Meissner) plexus are absent, resulting in reduced bowel peristalsis and function. Hirschsprung's disease is more common in male than female babies. The delayed passage of meconium together with distension of abdomen following feeds and bilious vomiting are the usual clinical features. Other pertinent clinical features include abdominal distension (which may cause the baby to breathe fast and grunt when breathing), constipation, and reduced feeding. Plain abdominal x ray may demonstrate dilated loops of bowel with fluid levels. Barium enema demonstrates a 'conical appearance' in the affected part due to the dilated ganglionic proximal colon and the distal aganglionic bowel failing to distend. The diagnosis, however, is frequently confirmed by rectal biopsy. Rectal manometry is also an useful investigation which is performed in certain centres. Surgery is the treatment of choice where the abnormal aganglionic section of colon is removed. The surgery is frequently a two-stage procedure with a colostomy being performed as a first stage, and a definitive procedure (rescetion or tarns-anal 'pull-through' of affected segments and colo-anal anstomosis) being performed later in the first year of life."

pediatrics,336,"A 4-year-old child is due to have his pre-school booster consisting of the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and DTP (diphtheria, tetanus and polio) vaccinations. He is usually fit and well. What is the absolute contraindication to being able to administer the MMR and DTP vaccinations in this child?",Administration of immunoglobulin over one year ago,Anaphylaxis to a prior dose of the same vaccination,Egg allergy,Mild intercurrent illness,Premature birth,B,From the list above there is only one absolute contraindication and that is anaphylaxis to a prior dose of the same vaccination.  Immunoglobulin can interfere with the response to measles vaccine and as such MMR should be deferred for as long as 11 months after it was administered. The amount of egg in MMR is very small and may only require special precautions not a complete avoidance. If a child has a moderate to severe infection with or without fever the vaccine should be deferred. Premature birth is not a contraindication to vaccination and these children should be vaccinated in the same chronological order as a full-term infant. 
pediatrics,337,You are starting work on the paediatric surgical unit and will need to understand the plasma kinetics of opiates as you will be required to prescribe for your patients. Which of the following represents the plasma kinetics of morphine salts in children?,Clearance in adolescents and children is 25% of that of adults,Clearance in adolescents and children is 50% of that of adults,Clearance in infants less than 1-month-old is 25% of that at 6-months-old,Clearance in infants less than 1-month-old is greater than in adults,There are no differences in plasma clearance between full term and premature babies,C,Plasma kinetics of morphine for children over 1 year are reported as being similar to adults. Differences are seen between premature and full term infants. Clearance in infants less than 1-month-old is only 25% of that of a 6-month-old child (half life of 7.3 hours compared to 2.3 hours). 
pediatrics,338,A 12-year-old girl is admitted to the paediatric ward with a moderate asthma exacerbation for the past 24 hours. Now the girl is doing well and ready for discharge. Her parents are still very anxious about the recurrent asthma attacks requiring admission. She is currently on inhaled beclometasone 200 micrograms twice daily with salbutamol when needed. What is the next step in the management plan?,Add leukotriene receptor antagonist,Add long-acting beta agonist,Check adherence and inhaler technique,Increase the dose of beclometasone to 400 micrograms twice daily,More frequent monitoring with a peak flow meter,C,"Asthma is a common condition which can cause significant morbidity and mortality. It is clear that much of this morbidity is related to poor management, especially poor adherence to preventative treatment. The British Thoracic Society has concluded that adherence and inhaler technique should always be thought of in the management of asthma. This conclusion was established after reviewing several studies that have shown evidence that adherence can be as low as 6% in some studies. Inhaler technique is suboptimal in:  23-43% of patients for pressurised metered dose inhaler (pMDI) 53-59% for dry powder inhaler (DPI), and 55-57% for pMDI plus spacer.  Even after adequate teaching, technique was only found to be satisfactory in 63% for pMDI, 65% for DPI, and 75% for breath-actuated MDI. "
pediatrics,339,"A 4-month-old boy is brought in dead to hospital. He had had a cold for three days, with crusty nose and mild fever. He went to bed at 7 pm as usual. Mother checked him at 11 pm before going to bed. In the morning she found him stiff and cold. He was brought to the Emergency department by ambulance, but resuscitation was unsuccessful. Mother is single 19 years and smokes 20 per day. He was born at 39/40 weighing 3.25 kg, and there were no neonatal problems. He had been growing along the 50th centile for height and weight.

pediatrics,340,"A 5-year-old female presents to the paediatric ward with a history of 'going off her legs' over the previous four days. She had chicken pox (varicella) two weeks previously and the last of her spots are just fading. Her mother states she came home from school three days previously complaining her legs hurt and since then has been refusing to walk. When she does walk she is very unsteady and her mother says she looks like she is drunk.  Her mother became increasingly concerned today as the child could no longer see the pictures clearly in the story book her mother was reading to her. She is reviewed by ophthalmology who state there is evidence of bilateral optic neuritis. She undergoes an MRI scan of her head which shows multiple lesions in the white matter of cerebral cortices, cerebellum and the spinal cord at the level of T4. Two days after her admission she has a seizure episode on the ward which self terminates but following this she drops her GCS to 6 and requires intubation and transfer to the paediatric intensive care unit. Which is the most appropriate treatment at this stage in the child's illness?",Intravenous aciclovir,Intravenous ceftriaxone,Intravenous immunoglobulin,Intravenous phenobarbitone,Intravenous phenytoin,C,"The case above describes a child with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), as evidenced by the development of focal neurological symptoms, optic neuritis and an MRI scan showing multiple white matter lesions following an episode of varicella infection. In this case there is no treatment mentioned that has been started but it is clear that the child's condition deteriorates substantially. Whilst it may be appropriate to start intravenous antibiotics or aciclovir in this case if infection is suspected the most immediate concern is progression of her initial diagnosis. In ADEM mild cases may often not require any treatment and may settle of their own accord with time. In more severe cases courses of steroids may result in improvement, in cases where there is a rapid deterioration in symptoms then the use of intravenous immunoglobulin is warranted as the benefits potentially outweigh the risks. Not all cases of ADEM will respond to steroids or immunoglobulin however. In this case the child has only had one brief fit which self terminated. Although she has dropped her GCS she has not had any further fits so it would be prudent to hold off intravenous phenytoin/phenobarbitone for the time being. Should there be concern however that the child may have further fits or is in non-convulsive status then it would be sensible to start one of these drugs."
pediatrics,341,A cardiac catheter study was arranged for a neonate with a murmur in the pulmonary area.

It is an abnormal opening between the left and right atrium. The clinical condition is usually mild with no clinical effects until adulthood if not treated. The catheter study in this patient has shown a step-up in O2 saturation in the left atrium, in addition to the murmur heard in the pulmonary area, which is an over-flow murmur through the pulmonary valve. Therefore, ASD is the diagnosis. Normal values are shown in the following table:      O2 saturation (%) Pressure (mmHg)   Right atrium 75 Mean = 3   Right ventricle 75 25/3   Pulmonary artery 75 25/8   Left atrium 98 Mean = 8   Left ventricle 98 110/8   Aorta 98 110/65"
pediatrics,342,A 3-week-old boy was brought to the GP by his worried parents who described large amounts of forceful milky vomiting after every feed for the previous five days. They said that despite repeated vomiting he still seemed to be hungry and seeking feeds. The GP suspected pyloric stenosis and referred to the local paediatric hospital. Which of the following would be the most appropriate initial management?,Emergency pyloromyotomy as soon as theatre space available,Emergency pyloroplasty as soon as theatre space available.,Rehydration with bolus if required and aim of correcting fluid and electrolyte imbalance within 48 hours then pyloromyotomy,Rehydration with high calorie formula then pyloromyotomy,Rehydration with maintenance fluids over two hours then pyloromyotomy,C,"Pyloric stenosis occurs in approximately 3 per 1000 live births, usually presenting at 2-4 weeks of age. A hypochloraemic alkalosis occurs. Investigation by barium/USS should be performed. Adequate rehydration followed by pyloromyotomy is the standard curative treatment for pyloric stenosis (a pyloromyotomy is an incision made into the pyloric muscles). In this case the electrolyte imbalance should be carefully corrected with regular rechecking of electrolyte levels and an initial bolus if required. Once the patient is rehydrated and electrolytes within normal range, a pyloromyotomy should be performed. It is very important to correct hypovolaemia and electrolyte disturbance before surgery as alkalosis prolongs the depression of the respiratory drive and increases the risk of apnoeas post operatively. Pyloroplasty is where the pylorus is cut and sutured into the duodenum. It is a surgical treatment in the management of peptic ulcer disease. Oral feeding should be discontinued and IV rehydration commenced as soon as possible. Two hours will not be sufficient to correct electrolyte imbalances."

pediatrics,344,"A 2-month-old presents with seizures and drowsiness. She has been well since birth, but for the past 2 days has not been able to eat or drink due to gastroenteritis. Bedside tests revealed hypoketotic hypoglycaemia. Investigations:  Plasma acylcarnitines - elevated C6-C10 acylcarnitines Urine organic acids - elevated medium-chain dicarboxylic acids Low ketones.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Fabry's disease,Gaucher's disease,Maple syrup urine disease,Medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD),Non-accidental injury,D,"Fatty acid beta-oxidation fuels hepatic ketogenesis, a major source of energy during fasting. In MCADD this process is deficient and individuals develop metabolic decompensation during fasting or with minor illness, with the characteristic metabolic profile described above. Neither Fabry's disease nor Gaucher's disease present with non-ketotic hypoglycaemia. They are lysosomal storage disorders. Maple syrup urine disease causes hyperketotic hypoglycaemia during metabolic crisis. Non-accidental injury, an insulin overdose, would not cause the metabolic profile identified in this case. In around 20% of children with MCADD, the initial metabolic decompensation can lead to sudden unexplained death. Without appropriate dietary management there will be repeated episodes of metabolic decompensation with neurological damage and loss of milestones. MCADD deficiency is now screened for in the newborn screening programme. MCADD is an autosomal recessive condition due to mutations in the ACADM gene. Between 1:40 and 1:100 northern Europeans are carriers for MCADD. "

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benign familial haematuria,Glomerulonephritis,Haemorrhagic cystitis,Henoch-Schönlein disease,Urinary tract infection,C,"The history of fever, gross haematuria with clots and suprapubic tenderness in a child with global delay suggests a delayed presentation of urinary tract infection (UTI) resulting in haemorrhagic cystitis. This should be treated aggressively with antibiotics. A renal ultrasound scan (USS) should be performed to look for structural abnormalities and to confirm resolution."
pediatrics,346,"You review an ex-28/40 preterm neonate on NICU, now term. He had necrotising enterocolitis and multiple bowel resections with an ileostomy, which has since been closed. He has 60 cm of small bowel remaining with an ileocaecal valve. What is the normal small bowel length for a term neonate?",100-150 cm,150-250 cm,250-300 cm,300-400 cm,400-500 cm,C,"Term neonates have approximately 250-300 cm of small bowel when stretched and measured on the anti-mesenteric border. Adults have approximately 600 cm. When less than 100 cm remain, varying degrees of intestinal failure should be expected:  less than100 cm - invariable need for short-term parental nutrition (PN), but long-term prognosis good less than75 cm - invariable need for long-term PN +/− reconstruction surgery, possible need for bowel/liver transplant less than25 cm - invariable need for long-term PN +/− reconstruction +/− bowel/liver transplant.  Other factors that affect intestinal failure include:  Intact ileocaecal valve (reduced risk) Degree of PN-related cholestasis Age at time of resection - premature infants have proportionally more growth of the remaining intestine Type of bowel remaining - ileum adapts better than jejunum, and Function of the remaining bowel.  Early closure of stomas and refeeding stoma output into the distal mucus fistula helps maintain mucosa integrity and increase the nutrient absorption. Tapering enteroplasty and imbrication techniques can be used to improve the bowel's propulsive efficiency, and Bianchi lengthening and STEP (serial transverse enteroplasty) procedures can be undertaken to lengthen the bowel.

On examination there is a pansystolic murmur and fidgety movements of the limbs. An ECG demonstrates first degree AV block. Serology demonstrates:    Anti-DNase B elevated   Anti-streptolysin O (ASOT) elevated    What would be your diagnosis?,Acute rheumatic fever,Bacterial endocarditis,Leukaemia,Septic arthritis,Viral myocarditis,A,"Acute rheumatic fever is an autoinflammatory response to infection with group A beta-haemolytic streptococcus (GABHS). It typically occurs 2-3 weeks after pharyngitis. 80% develop carditis. This is caused by antibodies generated against the bacteria cross-reacting with the myocardium. Children aged 5-15 years are most commonly affected. Low socioeconomic status is a risk factor. Diagnosis is based upon applying the Jones criteria, which is divided in five major and five minor diagnostic criteria. Major features are:  evidence of carditis arthritis chorea skin nodules, and erythema marginatum.  Minor features are:  arthralgia first degree AV block fever elevated C-reactive protein (CRP)/erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and evidence of previous GABHS infection (antibody, e.g., anti-streptolysin O-titre).  Diagnosis is made if two major or one major plus two minor features are present, plus lab evidence of infection. The case therefore meets the diagnostic criteria. This is not a presentation of bacterial endocarditis; classic features of this are splinter haemorrhages and Janeway lesions. Leukaemia is not correct as it presents with focal bone pain due to local infiltration combined with evidence of bone marrow failure. Septic arthritis is not correct because it usually affects a single, large joint. It can be caused by haematological spread of bacteria from endocarditis, but this does not fit the clinical picture. The Kocher criteria are believed to be the best to differentiate septic arthritis from transient synovitis:  History of fever Not weight bearing ESR greater than40 mm/hour White cell count greater than12 ×10^9 per mL  If all four factors are present then the probability of septic arthritis is 99.6%.^1 Viral myocarditis would present with a viral illness followed by evidence of acute cardiac failure. Causes include:  adenovirus coxsackie virus cytomegalovirus HIV HSV influenza, and mumps.  Diagnosis is made by echocardiogram, viral serology, and possibly endomyocardial biopsy.^2 The management of acute rheumatic fever has been reviewed by Webb et al.^3 Briefly, oral phenoxymethylpenicillin or IM benzylpenicillin is used to eradicate GABHS. Neither aspirin nor steroids has been shown to benefit acute carditis. Sodium valproate may help reduce chorea. Naproxen can be given to relieve joint pain. Long-term antibiotic prophylaxis with IM benzylpenicillin is recommended. "

pediatrics,351,A female infant is born at term. She appears pink except for the extremities which are bluish. Her pulse is 110 bpm and she is gasping. She has good muscle tone. She responds to nasal stimulation with airflow by grimacing. What is her APGAR score?,5,6,7,8,9,C,"The Apgar score was designed by Dr Virginia Apgar in 1952 as a quick scoring system to be performed at one and five minutes, and can be repeated at 10 minutes. There are five components:  A - appearance P - pulse G - grimace A - activity R - respirations.  A low score at one minute may indicate that the baby requires some medical attention. If the Apgar is still low at five or 10 minutes it can be a poor prognostic indicator suggesting the potential for neurological damage. In this case, the Apgar score can be calculated as follows:  Appearance - she is pink but peripherally cyanosed so 1 point Pulse - above 100 gets her 2 points Grimace - to catheter gets her 1 point Activity - movements she gets 2 points Respiration - gasping gets 1 point.  Therefore, her total is 7 points."

With a robertsonian translocation, two acrocentric chromosomes (21 in case of Down's) join to make 45 chromosomes but the correct amount of genetic material (hence balanced). When reproducing, one gamete will have 22 chromosomes the other 23 with two copies of chromosome 21s genes. There are two methods of screening for Down's syndrome:  Serum screening, and Ultrasound screening (nuchal translucency).  These can be used in combination (the combined test). The combined test can be taken between 10 weeks + 0 days to 14 weeks + 1 day in pregnancy. The serum screen measures free beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A). If a woman books later in pregnancy (when nuchal translucency is not as accurate, or if it is not technically possible to measure it) the quadruple test can be taken between 14 + 2 to 20 + 0 weeks of gestation. This measures free beta-hCG, alpha fetoprotein, inhibin-A and unconjugated oestriol. It is less accurate than the combined test. Once a screening test has been performed, the chance of having Down's syndrome is calculated using software that takes into account maternal factors such as age, weight and family origin, along with gestation of the pregnancy. The screening test is positive if this probability is equal to, or greater than, a nationally agreed cut-off level."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,Hepatitis D,Hepatitis E,A,"The history of being unwell for a few days with anorexia and vomiting in a child with a history of foreign travel, camping or contact with jaundice suggests an infective hepatitis. This is most likely to be Hepatitis A. The jaundice usually appears in the convalescent phase. Infection is often asymptomatic in younger children, becoming progressively more severe with age. Treatment is supportive. Advice should be given about hygiene (faecal-oral transmission) and the case notified to Public Health."
pediatrics,366,"A 6-month-old infant is admitted with vomiting. His parents report that he 'possets' frequently, and may bring up the whole bottle up to 'two hours' after a feed. His full blood count reveals a microcytic anaemia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency,Cystic fibrosis,Duodenal atresia,Hiatus hernia,Pyloric stenosis,D,This child's frequent vomiting and microcytic anaemia suggest a hiatus hernia with reflux. Cystic fibrosis would be associated with chest infections and iron deficiency but not the vomiting.
pediatrics,367,Which of the following is correct regarding pulmonary contusion in children?,Alveoli are filled with blood resulting in hypoxia,Artificial ventilation is always required,Is usually caused by penetrating injury,The chest x ray is always abnormal,There is always an associated rib fracture,A,"Blood enters the alveoli because the pulmonary capillaries rupture, and hypoxia ensues. Administration of high flow oxygen is necessary. Artificial ventilation on the paediatric intensive care unit is required in some cases. Pulmonary contusion is usually the consequence of blunt thoracic trauma. It is relatively common due to the mobility of the chest wall."
pediatrics,368,"A 2-month-old girl presents with severe cough. Like her older brother, she developed a coryzal illness 10 days ago, which appeared to be resolving. However, since this morning her mother reports that she has been coughing severely. Each episode can last up to 20-30 seconds. She goes red in the face, then vomits and seems exhausted. On examination she is cheerful and well. She has no fever and no respiratory symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Asthma,Gastroesophageal reflux,Inhaled foreign body,Pertussis,E,"Pertussis begins with a history of typical coryza. Subsequently a variety of toxins produced by the organism result in hypersensitisation of the cough reflex. Vaccination protects about 70% from severe disease. Spasms initially last only a few seconds, gradually worsen over a week or two, then improve gradually over up to six months. Clinical examination may be unremarkable, so the history and subsequent continued observations are key to diagnosis."
pediatrics,369,A 3-year-old boy presents with a history of chronic cough for the past three months. The cough is nocturnal just after going to bed. The parents feel that he might be coughing to seek attention. He has good exercise tolerance and no other complaints. There is no past medical history except for allergic rhinitis. pH studies last month did not show any abnormalities and trial of short-acting bronchodilator did not show any improvement. What is the next step in the management plan?,Barium swallow,Oesophageal manometry,Referral to behavioural therapy,Trial of intranasal corticosteroids,Trial of proton-pump inhibitor,D,"The most likely diagnosis is postnasal drip (also known as upper airway cough syndrome to include all aetiologies causing cough). It is caused by dripping of secretions from the posterior oropharynx to the airway, which will cause cough. Allergy is the most common aetiology, while sinusitis and vasomotor rhinitis are other rare aetiologies. This patient has a nocturnal cough. A nocturnal cough is often associated with asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD), but these are ruled out by the history of the child and the tests performed. Therefore, postnasal drip is most likely given that the child does have a history of allergic rhinitis. Trial of intranasal corticosteroids will help in treating and establishing the diagnosis. Habitual cough, which can be managed by behavioural therapy, is a diagnosis of exclusion that can be further investigated at a later stage."
pediatrics,370,You are asked to see a patient with severe malnutrition. What cardiovascular changes would you typically expect to see?,Increased blood pressure,Increased contractility,Increased heart rate,Increased stroke volume,Reduced heart rate,E,"Starvation causes several cardiovascular changes. Reduced heart rate, blood pressure and contractility are typical. During starvation or severe malnutrition, the body systems have to make many adaptations to reduced food intake. The effects on the cardiovascular system are as follows:  There is an osmotic diuresis which causes circulating volume to fall Prolonged starvation causes reduced heart rate and reduced stroke volume Release of amino acids from cardiac muscle to provide fuel for gluconeogenesis and ketone bodies for the brain which contributes to reduced cardiac muscle bulk Changes to the myocardium promotes increased electrical excitability and reduced contractility Arrhythmias are common, especially with concomitant electrolyte disturbance, particularly hypokalaemia, and In prolonged starvation, arrhythmias are a common cause of death."
pediatrics,371,"An 8-month-old girl presents with a three day history of vomiting and diarrhoea. The former lasted for 48 hours, and has now settled. The diarrhoea is watery and green, occurring 6-10 times a day, but contains no blood. She has wet her nappy once in the past 12 hours and is drinking poorly. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a temperature of 38.2°C, respiratory rate of 30/min and heart rate of 140/min. She is mottled, cool to the elbows and has a capillary refill time of 5 seconds. Abdomen is soft, skin turgor is reduced, mouth dry and eyes sunken. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial gastroenteritis,Septicaemia,Urinary tract infection,Viral gastritis,Viral gastroenteritis,E,"The history suggests prolonged diarrhoea and vomiting in an infant who has been drinking poorly. This has resulted in severe dehydration and shock, with peripheral vasoconstriction. Most cases of gastroenteritis in the UK are due to Rotavirus. The severity of presentation in this case is down to the delayed presentation. Bacterial gastroenteritis is also possible, though there is no blood in the stool. Bloody diarrhoea and renal failure might indicate haemolytic uraemic syndrome. A urinary tract infection can cause fever and vomiting, and may even cause some diarrhoea, but rarely to this extent. Given the severity of presentation septicaemia should be covered, although it is not the most likely diagnosis in a fully immunised child.  A fluid bolus of 20 ml/kg of N. saline should be given immediately, with a further 10-20 ml/kg if she remains shocked. Subsequent rehydration should take 24 hours unless serum sodium is more than 155 mmol/L. In hypernatraemia the skin may be 'doughy' in consistency. In such cases fluid replacement should be over 48-72 hours to reduce the risk of cerebral oedema. Given the severity of presentation, current NICE guidance would be to cover with antibiotics for 36 hours until cultures are negative. "
pediatrics,372,A mother presents with her 3-year-old son who has indistinct nasal speech. He snores at night and has restless sleep. He is tired by day. What is the best management strategy?,Arrange hearing test,Assess development milestones,Refer to ENT surgeon,Refer to speech therapist,MRI brain,C,Probable enlarged adenoid
pediatrics,373,Which of the following statements regarding the sweat test is true?,At least 25 mg of sweat is necessary for a reliable result,False positive results may be encountered in children with nephrotic syndrome,More than 60 mmol/L of chloride in sweat is diagnostic of cystic fibrosis (CF),Sweating is enhanced by application of atropine,The filter paper is left on for a total of about four hours,C,"The sweat test is conducted using pilocarpine iontophoresis. A 3 mA current carries pilocarpine into the skin of the forearm stimulating local sweating. The arm is washed with distilled water and sweat collected on a filter paper or gauze. The duration of collection is usually 30-60 minutes. The filter paper is removed, weighed and eluted in distilled water. At least 50 mg and preferably 100 mg of sweat should be collected for reliable results. It may not be possible to collect this amount in young infants. More than 60 mmol/L of chloride is diagnostic of CF when one or more other criteria are present. In healthy adults, the sweat chloride values increase slightly, but 60 mmol/L still differentiates CF from other conditions. False negative results may be encountered in nephrotic syndromes. "
pediatrics,374,A young boy presents with aches and pains. Which of the following features would argue against a diagnosis of rickets?,Advanced bone age,Bow legs,Low serum phosphate level,Normal serum calcium,Raised alkaline phosphatase,A,"Clinical features of rickets include:  bowing of tibia and fibula craniotabes (soft skull) thickening of forearm at the wrist, and thickening of the costochondral junction (rachitic rosary).  Dietary vitamin D deficiency stimulates secondary hyperparathyroidism, which causes:  increased renal excretion of phosphate low serum phosphate, and reduced urinary calcium excretion.  Calcium concentrations may be low or low normal. Raised alkaline phosphatase results from osteoblasts forming unmineralised matrix. Short stature and delayed bone age are associated, rather than advanced bone age."
pediatrics,375,A 12-year-old child presents with pelvic pain and bowing of the tibia. A diagnosis of rickets is suspected. Which one of the following statements is true regarding rickets?,Bone biopsy would show an increase in mineralised osteoid,Is due to vitamin A deficiency,May present with pseudo-fractures,Serum calcium is increased,Typically causes a distal myopathy,C,"Rickets is due to vitamin D deficiency. It can result from malabsorption, renal disease (familial hypophosphataemic rickets), chronic renal failure and anticonvulsant therapy. It often presents with bone pain and a proximal myopathy. The psuedo-fractures in the hip are termed Looser's zones. Serum calcium is low. A bone biopsy would show an decrease in the amount of mineralised osteoid."
pediatrics,376,An 11-month-old girl visits her GP with her mother who is worried that she is much paler than other children of her age. The GP takes a history and asks about risk factors for anaemia. Which of these is most likely to be the cause of her iron deficiency anaemia?,A co-existing folate deficiency in developed countries,Drinking cows' milk exclusively before 1 year of age,Late clamping of the umbilical cord,Low iron intake in developing countries,Vitamin E deficiency,B,"Drinking cows' milk exclusively before 1 year of age is most likely to be the cause of her iron deficiency anaemia. Although breast milk is low in iron, about 50% of the iron is bioavailable, whereas less than 20% of iron in cows' milk is bioavailable. Causes of iron deficiency anaemia include:  dietary insufficiency blood loss (for example, gastrointestinal) malabsorption (for example, coeliac disease) increased physiological requirement (for example, infancy).  In the United Kingdom, the most common cause in infancy is early weaning to cows' milk. Iron deficiency anaemia often has more significant consequences for young children compared to adults and can affect neurological development and physical growth. In studies using Bayley Scales of Infant Development, infants with iron deficiency anaemia received lower scores on mental and motor tests, including gross and fine motor coordination, and demonstrated affective differences, such as wariness, fearfulness, and unhappiness. Iron deficiency anaemia can be exacerbated by vitamin A and C deficiency but is not affected by vitamin E deficiency. Potentially vitamin E toxicity may exacerbate iron deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency is usually a single nutrient problem in developed countries, whereas it often co-exists with other deficiencies such as folate deficiency in developing countries. Early clamping of the umbilical cord can contribute to iron-deficiency anaemia, rather than late clamping. Low absorbable iron intake is the main cause of iron deficiency anaemia in developed countries, whereas the major causative factor in developing countries is low iron absorption with the iron intake being from poorly bioavailable plant sources; other possible causes of iron deficiency are intestinal worm infections, malaria, and vitamin A deficiency.

pediatrics,377,A 12-year-old boy presented with itching in his hands. Examination: skin is dry and red. His mother is asthmatic and elder brother has hay fever. What is the single most likely causative factor?,Dermatitis herpitiformis,Scabies,Eczema,Uremia,Drug induced,C,Itchy lesion and family history of asthma and hay fever in 1st degree relatives favours the diagnosis of eczema
pediatrics,378,A 3-year-old boy presents with difficulty in walking and skin lesions. What is the most likely causative agent?,Strep pyogenes,Rubella virus,Parvovirus,Papovirus,Paramyxovirus,C,Sometimes there may occur arthropathy for which children gets difficulty to walk. There occurs macular morbiliform rash in parvovirus infection following disappearance of rash of the cheeks
pediatrics,379,A 15-year-old girl presented with a 12 hour history of fever and global headache. On examination she was febrile (37.5°C). She was fully conscious. Mild neck stiffness was noted but there were no other neurological signs. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed:    Cell count 200/mL (60% lymphocytes)   Protein 0.8 g/L (0.15-0.45)   Glucose 4.3 mmol/L (3.3-4.4)   Gram stain No organisms seen    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Bacterial meningitis,Cryptococcal meningitis,Lymphomatous meningitis,Tuberculous meningitis,Viral meningitis,E,"Enteroviruses and mumps are the commonest causes of viral meningitis. Cerebrospinal fluid changes with bacterial meningitis typically include:  High protein Low glucose, and Neutrophil pleocytosis.  Cryptococcal meningitis is an infection of severely immunocompromised individuals, especially advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Tuberculous meningitis is an insidious illness, presenting over weeks and months."
pediatrics,380,A man with haemophilia has come to you for genetic counselling. Which of the following is correct regarding the inheritance of his condition?,All his daughters will be carriers,Half his sons will be normal,His mother is certainly the carrier from whom he inherited the disease,His sister cannot be a carrier,The condition is transmitted in an X-linked dominant fashion,A,"The disease is transmitted in an X-linked recessive fashion. His parents may have been affected, carriers, or even non-carriers if the disease occurred from a spontaneous mutation. His daughters will inherit the abnormal gene from their father and be carriers. His sons will be unaffected. If his sister has an affected son and a brother with the condition, the disease is not a new mutation and she must be a carrier."
pediatrics,381,You see an advert on television asking for donations towards a famine fund in sub- Saharan Africa and wonder about the prevalence of malnutrition. Approximately how many childhood deaths worldwide are linked to malnutrition?,1 in 2 childhood deaths,1 in 3 childhood deaths,1 in 10 childhood deaths,1 in 50 childhood deaths,1 in 100 childhood deaths,B,"Nearly 7 million children worldwide under the age of 5 years died in 2011. Over half of these were due to conditions that could be prevented or treated with access to simple, affordable interventions. Leading causes of death in under-5 children are pneumonia, preterm birth complications, diarrhoea, birth asphyxia and malaria. About one third of all child deaths are linked to malnutrition. Children in sub-Saharan Africa are nearly 17 times more likely to die before the age of 5 than children in developed regions. It is thought that between 6 and 14% of children who are inpatients in hospital have some degree of malnutrition. "
pediatrics,382,Which of the following is a form of generalised seizure?,Automatisms,Aversive seizures,Benign rolandic epilepsy,Epilepsia partialis continua,Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,E,"Seizures may be classified as Partial or Generalised seizures. Partial seizures include:  Simple partial (consciousness retained), motor, sensory, autonomic, psychic Complex partial (consciousness impaired): Simple partial followed by impaired consciousness, or consciousness impaired at onset, and Partial seizures with secondary generalisation.  Generalised seizures include:  Absences (typical or atypical) Generalised tonic clonic Tonic Clonic Myoclonic Atonic, and Infantile spasms.  Unclassified aversive seizures are a form of simple partial seizure, consisting of head turning and conjugate eye movements. Rasmussen's encephalitis is a subacute inflammatory encephalitis, and is one cause of epilepsia partialis continua. Complex partial seizures often contain automatisms which may be elementary (including lip smacking, chewing, swallowing or salivation), or automatic behaviour (semi-purposive unco-ordinated or unplanned gestures including picking and pulling at clothing). Rolandic epilepsy is a benign partial epilepsy associated with centro-temporal spikes. There is an excellent prognosis. "
pediatrics,383,A 3-year-old child has a high temperature for 4 days and he had not seen a doctor. Then mother notices rashes on buccal mucosa and some around the mouth. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?,Measles,Roseola infectiosum,Rubella,Chicken pox,Impetigo,A,Rash on buccal mucosa (koplicks spot) are characteristic of measles
pediatrics,384,"A 17-year-old male student presents with a three week history of thirst, polyuria, balanitis and weight loss. What is the most appropriate next investigation?",75 g glucose tolerance test,Fructosamine concentration,HbA1c,Random plasma glucose concentration,Urinary ketones,D,This patient obviously has diabetes mellitus and the diagnosis should be confirmed with either a fasting plasma glucose above 7 mmol/L or a random plasma glucose above 11.1 mmol/L.
pediatrics,385,"An infant born at 25 weeks gestation is now 2-weeks-old. He has been suffering with desats, bradys and episodes of apnoeas. He has had poor weight gain, is difficult to wean from the ventilator and has a 2 cm liver edge. You suspect a patent ductus arteriosus and wish to manage this medically with a course of indomethacin. What is the mechanism of action of indomethacin?",Competitive inhibitor of the ezymes CYP2C19 and CYP2C,Competitive non-selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor,Induces the P450 enzyme,Inhibition of the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes,Inhibits the synthesis of the bacterial wall,D,Indomethacin is a non-selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase 1 and 2. These enzymes participate in prostaglandin synthesis. If the enzyme has been inhibited the body is unable to produce prostaglandins. This has the ultimate aim to help close the patent ductus arteriosus.
pediatrics,386,"A 6-week-old infant is brought to the paediatric assessment unit coryzal and refusing feeds. Her parents report she has had a cold for a week and has been increasingly breathless for the past three days. Since yesterday she has been coughing and struggling to breastfeed. Her heart rate is 150 beats per minute, with a respiratory rate of 65 breaths per minute. On examination she is peripherally cold and sweaty with bounding femoral pulses. She has a right ventricular heave and a mid diastolic murmur as well as sub-costal recession and crepitations audible in both lung fields. Which is the single most likely diagnosis?",Bronchiolitis,Co-arctation of the aorta,Lower respiratory tract infection,Persistent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,E,"Respiratory distress in an infant can be cardiac, respiratory, metabolic or infective in origin. Respiratory distress due to heart failure typically presents with tachypnoea, poor feeding, cold peripheries and sweating, and may be precipitated by infection. Heart failure is caused by pressure overload, volume overload, myocardial dysfunction or arrhythmias. Obstructive defects, such as aortic stenosis or co-arctation, cause pressure overload, whilst left to right shunts, due to ventricular septal defects, or occasionally a persistent duct, cause volume overload. Significant obstructive lesions present shortly after birth as the ductus arteriosus closes. Left to right shunts present as pulmonary vascular resistance falls, usually after the first week of life. Large ventricular septal defects classically present with heart failure and pulmonary hypertension at 4-6 weeks of age as pulmonary vascular resistance falls. Blood flow across a large defect is unrestricted and lacks the classical systolic murmur of a smaller defect. An apical mid diastolic murmur due to turbulence over the mitral value (due to relative stenosis) may be audible. Co-arctation of the aorta may present in the early neonatal period following ductal closure and has classically weak or absent femoral pulses. A persistent duct rarely results in heart failure and is associated with a continuous murmur in the left infraclavicular region. Both bronchiolitis and lower respiratory tract infections present with respiratory distress and feeding difficulties, and may precipitate heart failure, but would not account for the cardiac signs described."
pediatrics,387,"A 12-year-old boy is a passenger in the right rear seat of a car in a road traffic accident (RTA) at 30 mph. He is thrown forward in the frontal impact but is restrained by his 3-point seatbelt. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination he is apyrexial, with respiratory rate 15/min, and pulse 100/min. He is pale and sweaty with a capillary refill time of 3 seconds. He has bruising across his lower abdomen. His abdomen is tender to touch generally. Which structure is most likely to be injured?",Aorta,Liver,Lumbar spine,Peritoneum,Spleen,E,The history is of deceleration injury during an RTA. The seat belt will run across the left side of the abdomen. This can cause injuries to the lumbar spine and intra-abdominal organs. Lap-belts give much poorer restraint that 3-point restraints. The most mobile structure is most at risk. This is likely to be the spleen.
pediatrics,388,"A 3-year-old girl presents with pallor and marked gland enlargement. She has been unwell for the past three weeks. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 37.6°C, and she looks pale and unwell. She has a few petechiae on the neck and palate, with moderate generalised lymphadenopathy and an 3 cm spleen. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukaemia,Cough petechiae,HIV,Idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura,Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,A,"The history is of enlarged reticuloendothelial system with abnormalities in all 3 cell lines of the bone marrow (pallor, fever and petechiae). The most likely diagnosis is therefore acute (lymphoblastic) leukaemia. Lymphadenopathy may be prominent: mediastinal nodes are characteristic of T-cell leukaemia. In lymphoma the marrow involvement tends to be much less. "
pediatrics,389,Which of the following is true regarding sensorineural hearing loss?,Approximately 1 per 100 children will have greater than 40 db hearing loss,The incidence is half as high in babies admitted to neonatal intensive care units compared with the normal population,The risk is increased in children who have had post-natal rubella,The risk is increased in Down syndrome,The risk is increased in Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome,D,"Sensorineural hearing loss is caused by lesions in the cochlea or the auditory nerve or central connections. It may be unilateral or bilateral. The overall incidence is about 2 in 1000 children. Language acquisition and secondary educational difficulties follow, with social isolation, and an increased risk of mental health problems. The risk factors for sensori-neural deafness include:  NICU admission - low birth weight, less than 32 weeks gestation, prolonged ventilation, prolonged jaundice, ototoxic drugs, hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, neonatal meningitis Congenital infection (rubella, CMV) Dysmorphic syndromes (affecting head and neck) Family history of a close relative needing a hearing aid below the age of 5 years Infections - acute bacterial or TB meningitis, mumps Down syndrome - some 10%-15% of children with Down syndrome develop sensorineural deafness.  If all risk factors are considered only around 50% of cases could be identified by testing between 5 and 10% of all babies. Conductive hearing loss is related to middle ear pathology. This is commoner in Down syndrome, cleft palate, Turner's syndrome, and facial malformation syndromes. In Down syndrome: 60%-70andamp; of children develop conductive deafness due to glue ear. The eustachaian tube is small and glue ear may begin before the age of 1. In Werdnig-Hoffman syndrome (Spinal muscular atrophy type 1) hearing is normal. Copyright "

Treatment includes steroids and treating the underlying disorder. Erythema nodosum is appropriately treated through treating the underlying condition - causes include sarcoid, mycoplasma pneumonia and drugs. Sebaceous cysts, lipomas and dermatofibromas are appropriately treated with surgery and do not respond to topical therapies."
pediatrics,391,A 15-year-old boy has been immobilised for six weeks due to a fracture of his femur after a skiing accident. He has become depressed and irritable during the past few days and complained of nausea and constipation. He is found to have microscopic haematuria and a blood pressure of 150/100 mmhg. What would the most appropriate next step?,Check blood pressure every three hours for two days,Collect urine for measurement of calcium/creatinine ratio,Measure 24 hour urinary protein,Order a renal sonogram and intravenous pyelogram,Request a psychiatric evaluation,B,"Hypercalcaemia can occur in children who are immobilised following the fracture of weight bearing joints. Serious complications of immobilisation include hypercalcaemia and hypercalciuria which may lead to nephropathy, nephrocalcinosis, and hypertensive encephalopathy. Early symptoms of hypercalcaemia are constipation, anorexia, vomiting, polyuria and lethargy which are nonspecific and may be attributed to the injury itself. Management of such a case includes serial measurements of ionised calcium and urinary calcium-creatinine ratio is critical during immobilisation. A ratio more than 0.2 establishes the diagnosis of hypercalciuria. Measures such as vigorous intravenous hydration, dietary restriction of dairy products and administration of diuretics can be instituted. Complete mobilisation is curative. Checking of the blood pressure is important but will not help in reaching the correct diagnosis. Measuring of 24 hour proteins would be indicated after measurement of calcium-creatinine ratio. Ordering a renal sonogram would be important to exclude nephrocalcinosis and measurement of renal size. Request of a psychiatric evaluation would not be indicated as the child's symptoms are attributable to hypercalcaemia and not psychiatric disturbance."
pediatrics,392,"A 5-year-old child is sent to your clinic for review. The GP noted some clinical features of rickets and consequently sent some blood tests. Unfortunately he is unable to interpret them and has sent the results to you in the following format:    Calcium Low   Phosphate High   PTH High   25-hydroxyvitamin D normal   1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D Low   Alkaline phosphate High    What is the diagnosis?",Chronic renal failure,Dietary calcium deficiency,Vitamin D deficiency,Vitamin D dependent rickets,X linked hypophosphataemia,A,"The only condition from the list given that fits these investigation findings is chronic renal failure. Calcium levels will be low in vitamin D deficiency, vitamin D dependent rickets, dietary calcium deficiency and chronic renal failure. In X linked hypophosphataemia the calcium level will be normal. Phosphate level will be low in all these conditions bar chronic renal failure. PTH levels will be high in all of these conditions bar X linked hypophosphataemia where it will be normal. 25-hydroxyvitamin D will be normal in all these conditions bar Vitamin D deficiency. 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D will be increased in dietary calcium deficiency, relatively decreased in X linked hypophosphataemia, increased or decreased in Vitamin D dependent rickets and Vitamin D deficiency and decreased in chronic renal failure. Alkaline phosphatase will be increased in all of the conditions listed."
pediatrics,393,A 15-year-old girl presents to the Emergency department with abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea for the past 3 days. She has not travelled outside the UK in the previous 12 months. What is the most likely causative organism?,Campylobacter jejuni,Cryptosporidium parvum,Salmonella typhi,Shigella flexneri,Staphylococcus aureus,A,"Of the options given, campylobacter is the most common cause of dysentery (bloody diarrhoea). It usually originates in raw and undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk and contaminated water. The incubation period is typically 2-5 days. In addition to diarrhoea, it results in cramps, fever and vomiting which normally resolves over 2-10 days. Treatment is usually symptomatic (i.e. oral fluids). Antibiotics can be used in severe cases, early in the disease. Human cryptosporidiosis causes self-limited diarrhoeal illness in healthy individuals, mostly children; and severe prolonged diarrhoea in patients with AIDS. Transmission is via human-to-human fecal-oral contamination. Animals are the major reservoir and outbreaks have been associated with water supplies and public swimming pools, as the organism can survive despite being in chlorine. Constipation rather than diarrhoea is a symptom of typhoid. Shigella can cause dysentery, but the commonest form is Shigella sonnei, and most cases in the UK are associated with foreign travel. Staphylococcus aureus can cause a self-limiting gastroenteritis characterised by severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. However, it is self-limiting and patients recover within 8-24 hours."

There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.9°C. He looks unwell and has pale conjunctivae. He has some petechiae on the trunk, and bloods show a pancytopenia. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukaemia,"Anaemia, iron deficiency",Child abuse,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Meningococcal disease,A,"The history of pallor, petechiae and pancytopenia an acute (lymphocytic) leukaemia. This is the commonest malignancy in childhood. The prognosis has improved enormously over the past 20 years. In this case at least two marrow cell lines (red cells and platelets) are affected."
pediatrics,396,Which of the following conditions is NOT characterised by unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia?,Crigler-Najjar Syndrome type 1,Dubin Johnson Syndrome,Gilbert Syndrome,Lucey-Driscoll Syndrome,Physiological jaundice of the newborn,B,"Bilirubin is a product of the metabolism of haem from erythrocyte breakdown. In the macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system (spleen, marrow and liver Kupffer cells) haem is oxidised to biliverdin, then reduced to form unconjugated bilirubin. The iron core (Fe3+) is removed. Unconjugated bilirubin travels in the blood firmly bound to albumin and reaches the liver where it is actively transported into hepatocytes. Several reactions occur in the hepatocytes: first binding to a protein called ligandin, then conjugation by an enzyme called uridine diphosphate (UDP-) glucuronyltransferase. This enzyme causes binding of 1 or 2 molecules of glucuronic acid producing mono- and di-glucuronides which are collectively called conjugated bilirubin. This is then actively pumped into the bile canaliculi. Dubin Johnson syndrome is a disorder of conjugated bilirubin while the other options are unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemias. Physiological jaundice of the newborn has several main aetiological mechanisms but always involves a rise in unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemias. This is mostly related to increased RBC turnover, with more haem available from ineffective erthropoeisis and reduced rate of conjugation due to a relative lack of UDP glucuronyltransferase and conjugation inhibitors in breast milk. Gilbert syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome both affect the conjugation step with the enzyme UDP-glucuronyltransferase. In Gilbert syndrome, a mutation of the gene for this enzyme occurs and it works more slowly than usual. Gilbert syndrome is characterised by a small increase in unconjugated bilirubin, particularly after fasting or intercurrent infection. There is no serious underlying liver pathology. Conversely in Crigler-Najjar syndrome, there is complete (type 1) or partial (type 2) absence of the enzyme UDP glucuronyltransferase. Complete absence of this enzyme is usually fatal within the first year of life unless liver transplantation can be arranged. Type 2 disease responds well to therapy with phenobarbital which reduces the bilirubin concentration and therefore has a good prognosis. Lucey-Driscoll syndrome is a familial neonatal disorder where there are circulating inhibitory proteins which temporarily inhibit conjugation. The jaundice settles within 1-2 weeks since birth and there are no long-term effects. Dubin Johnson syndrome is a disorder of conjugated bilirubin - bilirubin is made and conjugated, but the main abnormality is a problem pumping the conjugated bilirubin into the canaliculi. This means the pigment remains in the liver cells, which appear dark brown or black when examined under a microscope. This syndrome is generally quite benign with few symptoms."
pediatrics,397,The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify small amounts of DNA for further analysis. To do this the DNA double helix must first be split into two strands. How is this achieved?,Alkali solution,Centrifugation,DNA polymerase,Heating to nearly 100°C,Viral reverse transcriptase,D,To the small sample of DNA are added two oligonucleotides with sequences that have affinity for both ends of the area of DNA that is being studied. A thermostable DNA polymerase is also added. At 94°C DNA literally melts into two single strands and with cooling the oligonucleotides bind to the areas surrounding the particular area of DNA that is being analysed. These act as primers for the DNA polymerase and a new double helix of DNA is formed. The cycle is repeated doubling the amount of DNA each time.
pediatrics,398,A 2-year-old child presents to their primary care physician with bilateral periorbital bruising. His mother states he has not been himself for the last few months having been increasingly tired and not wanting to finish his meals; she feels he has also lost some weight. On examination there is a palpable mass in the abdomen but it is unclear from where it may be arising. What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?,Bilateral periorbital rhabdomyosarcoma,Bilateral retinoblastoma,Medulloblastoma,Metastatic neuroblastoma,Nephroblastoma,D,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour in infancy. It is a malignancy of the sympathetic nervous system arising from neuroblasts (pluripotential sympathetic cells). Signs and symptoms vary with site of presentation but can often be vague with symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss and abdominal pain. Many children present with already relatively advanced stage disease that has metastasised and their most common presentation is that of bone pain and limp. Children with advanced metastatic neuroblastoma may also present with bilateral periorbital ecchymosis secondary to metastasis to the orbits (known as 'racoon eyes'). Other children may present with abdominal masses that are noticed by their parents or on routine assessment for other problems. Intractable diarrhoea may be another presenting feature secondary to a paraneoplastic syndrome, but this is rare. Opsoclonus and myoclonus, or 'dancing eyes' syndrome is another possible presentation of neuroblastoma in association with a paraneoplastic syndrome."
pediatrics,399,"A 12-hour-old infant has an episode of desaturation and bradycardia on the neonatal unit. She was born at 42/40 following a difficult forceps delivery for fetal distress. Her Apgar scores were 1 at 1 minute and 2 at 5 minutes. She was resuscitated vigorously and transferred ventilated to the NICU. On arrival her temperature was 36.1°C, she was taking occasional gasps and HR was 100/min. There were no obvious dysmorphic features, but she remained floppy and pale. She was given 20 ml/kg of N. saline intravenously. Cord gases showed pH of 7.12 and base deficit of 24. O2 saturations were 92% in air. She was stabilised on the ventilator at 16/4, 35% O2 60/min, inspiratory time of 0.5 seconds. After a few hours of relative stability she developed drops in saturation associated with mouthing movements on the ET tube. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cardiac dysrhythmia,Hypoglycaemia,Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy,Meconium aspiration,Septicaemia,C,"The history suggests a hypoxic ischaemic insult in the perinatal period associated with significant acidosis and depression of conscious level. The subsequent episodes of mouthing and desaturation are likely to represent ictal activity. Neonatal seizures may be difficult to diagnose with eye, mouth, and tonic extension movements being commonest. Apnoea is commonest in preterm infants. In jittery babies the tremor can be stopped by holding the affected limb. "

What is the single most immediate management?,Nebulized adrenaline,Nebulized salmetarol and oxygen,Needle cricothyrodotomy,Oropharyngeal airway,Intubation of airway,E,Soot in the mouth and nose and noisy breathing occurs in inhalation injury where intubation of the airway is indicated
pediatrics,401,Consider a fetus affected with one of the following conditions. For which condition is spontaneous loss during pregnancy most likely?,Down syndrome,Huntington disease,Neurofibromatosis type 1,Retinoblastoma,Trisomy 18,E,"Chromosomal abnormalities are the number one cause of fetal loss, and trisomy 18 is less compatible with survival than trisomy 21."
pediatrics,402,Which of the following conditions requires early surgery if detected in the newborn period?,Inguinal hernia,Sternomastoid tumour,Tongue-tie,Umbilical hernia,Undescended testicle,A,"Sternomastoid tumours in the neonatal period do not, generally speaking, require surgical correction in the neonatal period. They usually cause a torticollis and physiotherapy is indicated. If severe, division of the muscle is sometimes required. Umbilical hernias usually resolve spontaneously by the second year. If the defect enlarges, or if associated with any symptoms, surgery may be considered, however this is fairly rare. Undescended testes are not fixed in the neonatal period. If descent has not taken place by one year of age, surgery is required, as spontaneous descent is unlikely. Tongue tie is common and arises as a result of a relatively short lingual fraenulum. It is not of functional significance and does not necessarily require surgery. Inguinal hernias do warrant surgery due to possible complication of strangulation."
pediatrics,403,"A 3-year-old child presents with deteriorating ataxia. Urine examination reveals a sweet smell and the presence of leucine, Valine and Isoleucine. What is the diagnosis?",Cystinuria,Cystinosis,Homocystinuria,Maple Syrup Urine Disease,Phenylketonuria,D,"This patient has maple syrup urine disease, an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by sweet smelling urine due to the presence of the above inadequately metabolised amino acids. Children may be severely affected from birth with ketosis and mental retardation or a less severe form may result in developmental delay and neurological symptoms such as ataxia."
pediatrics,404,"A mother brings her 2-year-old child to the emergency department. She is worried because he has been passing blood in his urine for the last week. She provides a sample of urine collected from his nappy earlier that day which tests positive for blood on urine analysis. The sample is sent to the laboratory and shows greater than100 RBC on microscopy but with a WCCless than1 and no organisms seen. The child appears well, his examination reveals nothing abnormal and all of his observations are within normal parameters. An hour later his mother brings a nappy to you which contains urine with evidence of blood within it. The child undergoes a series of blood tests which show that he is not anaemic and his clotting is not deranged. A clean catch sample does not contain any red blood cells. He is admitted to the ward for observation and because further urine samples show blood he undergoes an ultrasound scan of his abdomen, particularly looking at his kidneys, ureters and bladder. The scan is normal. His mother is extremely anxious as her niece has recently been diagnosed with a Wilms' tumour and she feels this may be an early presentation of this. She asks if there are any other investigations that can be done and should she be seeking a second opinion. To reassure the mother and ensure nothing is being missed a CT scan of the abdomen is performed. A review of the child's medical history shows the child has presented on two previous occasions with a similar presentation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asymptomatic kidney stone,Fabricated illness (previously Munchausen syndrome by proxy),Nephritic syndrome,Neuroblastoma,Wilms' tumour,B,"Munchausen syndrome by proxy (now referred to as fabricated illness) is a factitious disorder in which parents either induce or simulate physical symptoms in a child. Signs and symptoms vary and can include:  fractures poisoning (including salt poisoning) unusual injuries, and complaints of recurrent apnoea or vomiting in infants.  These children often undergo extensive and unnecessary investigations, many of which have significant risks to them. Up to 10% of these children die as a result of their parents' actions. This condition is considered to be a form of child abuse and management involves separation of the child from the parent if they are at significant risk."
pediatrics,405,Malnutrition is a common and devastating condition. Which electrolyte disturbance is common in those who are malnourished?,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hyperphosphataemia,Hypokalaemia,E,"In those who are malnourished the most common electrolyte abnormalities are:  hypokalaemia hypocalcaemia hypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia.  Prolonged malnutrition is associated with multiple changes to body systems and physiology adapts to a reduced dietary supply of minerals. Changes in renal physiology include increased aldosterone secretion and a reduced glomerular filtration rate. There is increased urinary excretion of potassium, calcium, magnesium and phosphate, causing a tendency to hypokalaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia and hypophosphataemia over time. The reduced muscle bulk in people with severe malnutrition causes low levels of production of urea and creatinine, although reduced excretion causes plasma levels to be normal or slightly reduced. As muscle is broken down to provide substrates for gluconeogenesis, a negative nitrogen balance ensues."
pediatrics,406,"A 9-year-old boy presents with fever and joint pains. Initially the pain affected his right wrist, but now affects his left wrist and right ankle. He had tonsillitis four weeks previously treated with oral penicillin. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination temperature is 38.7°C, respiratory rate 15/min, heart rate 95/min. 2/6 ejection systolic murmur at the left sternal edge. His left wrist and right ankle are exquisitely tender, such that even the bedclothes cause pain. His ESR is 95 mm/hr and CRP 129 mg/l. ECG shows a PR interval of 0.15s. His ASOT is 800 IU/L. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute rheumatic fever,Bacteraemia/sepsis,Henoch-Schönlein disease,Septic arthritis,Urinary tract infection,A,"The history of sore throat followed by fever, migratory polyarthritis and heart murmur suggest acute rheumatic fever. This is diagnosed using the Duckett-Jones criteria, i.e. evidence of streptococcal infection plus either two of the following major criteria or one major and two miner criteria: Major criteria:  Arthritis Carditis Nodules Erythema marginatum, or Chorea.  Minor criteria:  Fever Arthralgia Raised acute phase reactants, or Prolonged PR interval."
pediatrics,407,"You are looking to establish dose comparability of a drug which has just been licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults, for a 12-18-year-old population with the disease.  From your studies so far, you hypothesise that metabolism of the drug is similar between the two populations. How best would you investigate the pharmacokinetics of your drug?","Blood sampling a larger paediatric population, taking sparse samples at different time points",Blood sampling at many time points in a small age descending population,Looking for adverse effects of your drug such as hypoglycaemia in a large population,Measuring excretion of the metabolites of your drug in urine only,Measuring the effect of your drug on mean blood glucose only and not collecting PK data,A,"The answer is blood sampling a larger paediatric population, taking sparse samples at different time points. Measuring pharmacokinetics is difficult in the paediatric population, as to estimate the level of maximal drug concentration, (c-max), the time taken to reach it, (t-max), and the total drug exposure, (AUC), in a traditional study design requires lots of samples to be taken from the same patient. One way around this is to take more sparse samples from a larger number of patients over different time points, this allows determination of how a drug is metabolised via a so-called andquot;population PKandquot; approach. Ethically this is much more acceptable, as far less blood is taken from each individual patient.  Measuring PD effects alone, be they effect on mean glucose, or increase in hypoglycaemic events, is not acceptable, as hints about extremes of drug metabolism may not be discovered before a wider patient population is exposed. Whilst measuring drug excretion or metabolites in urine is one approach to measuring drug exposure, it does not give an estimate of c-max, and c-max may be associated with specific adverse effects of the agent you are testing."
pediatrics,408,Which of the following would be regarded as a contraindication to pertussis vaccination in a young child?,Allergic reaction to the initial dose,Atopic eczema,Cerebral palsy,Prior history of febrile convulsions,Temperature of 37.2°C,A,"The pertussis vaccine is of far more benefit than risk. The only absolute contraindication is allergy to previous pertussis immunisation. Febrile convulsions and cerebral palsy are not contraindications. Immunisation should be avoided during febrile illness. The new acellular vaccine has far fewer side effects than the whole cell previously used, and appears equally effective. In children with an unstable neurological condition, for example, poorly controlled epilepsy or undiagnosed evolving neurological condition, immunisation should be deferred until the situation stabilises."
pediatrics,409,"A 14-year-old boy with known cystic fibrosis presents to outpatient clinic complaining of increasing wheeze and cough over the last three months despite regular use of his nebulisers, physiotherapy and prophylactic flucloxacillin. Blood tests reveal a significantly raised IgE level. A chest x ray shows some patchy areas of bronchiectasis which had not been seen on previous x rays. A bronchoalveolar lavage is performed which grows Aspergillus fumigatus. Select the most appropriate management:",Intravenous fluconazole for two weeks and oral corticosteroids for three months,Intravenous voriconazole and intravenous hydrocortisone for two weeks,Oral corticosteroids for up to six months,Oral itraconazole for two weeks,Oral itraconazole for two weeks and oral corticosteroids for three months,C,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis can present in up to 11% of children with cystic fibrosis and 1-2% of children with asthma. It presents with a worsening in their respiratory symptoms with cough and wheeze. Children with cystic fibrosis are more at risk of colonisation by Aspergillus species due to it easily getting trapped in the tenacious secretions in their lungs, this in turn sets up an immune response which is the reason behind their worsening respiratory symptoms. Chronic mucosal colonisation causes elevated IgG and IgE levels which in turn result in bronchospasm. Chronic colonisation may also lead to bronchiectasis. The mainstay of management of children with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is oral corticosteroids to help reduce the IgE levels and thus prevent bronchospasm. This treatment is usually daily for two weeks followed by every other day for a total of three months. Some children will relapse after this course of treatment and may require a further course of corticosteroids. Antifungal treatment is generally not required."
pediatrics,410,A NICE review is conducted on a novel vaccination which is thought to reduce admission rates and symptoms from pneumococcal pneumonia versus comparators. Which of the following is the most important factor that NICE consider with respect to reimbursement?,% reduction in days admitted to hospital,% reduction in symptoms of shortness of breath,Cost of the product,EQ5D scoring,Modelled improvement in QALYs,E,"The answer is modelled improvement in Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). QALYs are used by NICE to determine the value of medicines. They are calculated by taking account of improvement in clinical parameters and quality of life scores such as EQ5D. Cost of the product and improvement in clinical markers are of course important, but they form inputs to any model determining value for money, rather than carrying individual importance."
pediatrics,411,A 14-year-old girl presents to her GP. She is concerned because she feels that she is not developing like her friends. She likes school and reports that she is doing well. On examination she looks well and is between the second and ninth centile for her height and ninth centile for weight. She has breast buds and sparse pubic hair. Olfactory and ophthalmic function is intact. Blood tests reveal that she has normal LH/FSH levels. Which is the most likely cause of her pubertal delay?,Anorexia nervosa,Bardet-Biedl syndrome,Constitutional delay,Craniopharyngioma,Kallmann syndrome,C,"All of the answer options are differential diagnoses of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. By far the most common cause of this is constitutional delay. Measurement of LH/FSH is useful to help classify the cause of delayed puberty.  Elevated gonadotropins - gonadal disease or primary hypogonadism Low or normal gonadotropins - hypothalamic/hypopituitary disease or secondary hypogonadism.  Differentiating constitutional delay from idiopathic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism is often difficult; there is no single test and these children must be followed up to ensure that a diagnosis is not missed. Differential diagnosis of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism:  Constitutional delay of puberty (most common)  Congenital deficiency:  Hereditary hypopituatarism Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH) Kallmann syndrome Prader-Willi Bardet-Biedl syndrome LH and FSH receptor defects  Acquired deficiency:  Functional Chronic disease Anorexia nervosa Excessive exercise Hypothyroid Hyperprolactinaemia  Anatomic:  Pituitary tumours Craniopharyngioma Head trauma Drugs (opiates, marijuana) Infiltrative disease.  Anorexia nervosa is far less common than constitutional delay and a child is unlikely to be on a greater weight centile than height centile and look well if they have anorexia. However it is always important to be aware of a potential diagnosis of anorexia in this scenario. The usual symptoms for craniopharyngioma include headaches and visual disturbances. It would be unusual for a child to present with delayed puberty without any other associated features. Kallmann syndrome is an association of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with anosmia. The question states that olfactory function is intact. Bardet-Biedl is the association of retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, polydactyly, mental retardation, hypogonadism. The question states that she is on the 10th centile for weight and is doing well at school."
pediatrics,412,"A 5-year-old boy is referred to the hospital and seen with his father who is worried that he has been listless.

However, the patency of this connection after birth is abnormal. It occurs in 5-10% of congenital heart disease, excluding preterm babies. In this catheter study, there is a step-up of saturation in the pulmonary artery; this is abnormal because the blood in the pulmonary artery usually has no source of oxygenation. Normal values are shown in the following table:      O2 saturation (%) Pressure (mmHg)   Right atrium 75 Mean = 3   Right ventricle 75 25/3   Pulmonary artery 75 25/8   Left atrium 98 Mean = 8   Left ventricle 98 110/8   Aorta 98 110/65"
pediatrics,414,With which of the following conditions is Hirschsprung's disease most commonly associated?,Angelman's syndrome,Down's syndrome,Prader-Willi syndrome,Turner's syndrome,Williams syndrome,B,"Hirschsprung's disease occurs in about 1 in 5000 births. It is caused by failure of craniocaudal migration of ganglion cell precursors at 5-12 weeks gestation. Presentation is usually either by delayed passage of meconium (greater than48 hours) or acute neonatal obstruction. The affected segment of the colon fails to relax, causing an obstruction. Hirschsprung's disease is found in 3-10% of those with Down's syndrome. Angelman's syndrome is characterised by:  Intellectual and developmental delay Sleep disturbance Seizures Jerky movements (especially hand-flapping) Frequent laughter or smiling, and Usually a happy demeanour.  Prader-Willi syndrome is associated with:  Hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy Narrow forehead Almond shaped eyes Narrow nasal bridge Thin upper lip, carp shaped mouth, micrognathia Small hands and feet Clinodactyly, syndactyly Scoliosis Short stature Mental retardation Obesity and insatiable appetite Emotional lability Hypogonadism (micropenis, hypoplastic scrotum, cryptorchidism) Delayed menarche in girls Diabetes Life expectancy reduced due to obesity.  Turner's syndrome is associated with: Neonatal:  Oedema of hands/feet Nuchal skin folds LBW, reduced length Cardiac lesion - bicuspid aortic valve, coarctation of aorta, aortic stenosis, hypoplastic left heart DDH  Childhood:  Short stature Epicanthic folds Small mandible Prominent ears High palate Webbed neck Low posterior hairline Prominent shield chest Widely spaced nipples Cubitum valgum Grommets common Hyperconvex fingernails  Teenage:  Failed onset of puberty 1/3 renal anomalies Up to 1/3 hypothyroid Scoliosis more common 70% impairment of motor/visuospatial skills Increased risk of Crohn's Increased keloid scar formation.

pediatrics,415,"A term infant is noted to have abdominal distension and greenish vomits after a formula feed (at approximately two hours of life). He was born by spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 + 2 weeks gestation, with polyhydramnios on antenatal scans and triple test risk of 1/90. He is pale and floppy, with an obvious protruding tongue. Abdomen is distended with scanty bowel sounds. He is admitted to the neonatal unit for further evaluation, including a chest and abdominal x ray. What is the sign most likely to be demonstrated on x ray?",Absence of gas in the rectum,Double bubble sign,Nasogastric tube not reaching stomach,Pneumatosis intestinalis,Small bowel above the diaphragm,B,"The history suggests a clinical picture of Down's syndrome with associated gastrointestinal (GI) abnormality. Duodenal atresia is most likely in this context. Duodenal atresia (DA) is more likely in Down's syndrome (20-40% cases of DA have Down's syndrome, and 8% children with Down's have DA). The clinical course fits best with obstruction at this level. Absent air in the rectum suggests Hirschsprung's disease (HD), which usually presents with delayed passage of meconium rather than early signs of obstruction. It is associated with Down's syndrome (10% cases of HD have Down's syndrome and 1.5% children with Down's syndrome have HD). The history does not fit with oesophageal atresias or trachea-oesophageal fistulas as the vomits are bilious, which could not occur as the obstruction here is very proximal. Necrotising enterocolitis would usually present later in a preterm infant or with other risk factors present. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is unlikely in this case, because the abdomen is distended, there were normal antenatal scans, and these children tend to present with respiratory symptoms rather than early obstruction. CHD is also only rarely associated with Down's syndrome. "
pediatrics,416,You are asked to see a 3-year-old boy with severe chronic malnutrition. You are concerned about kwashiorkor. What clinical feature is common in kwashiorkor?,Abdominal fistulae,Abdominal swelling,Corneal clouding,Hyperthermia,Liver cirrhosis,B,"Kwashiorkor is the inadequate intake of protein predominantly and is associated with oedema, abdominal swelling and fat accumulation in the liver causing hepatomegaly. In order to preserve health the body needs adequate energy and protein to meet its requirements. Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) or protein energy undernutrition (PEU) occurs when a patient's intake is insufficient to meet the body's needs, either because intake is inadequate or because requirements have increased with no corresponding increase in intake. Sadly, there are many places in the world where undernutrition in children is commonplace. In the past, a variety of terminology has been used for undernutrition. Kwashiorkor is the inadequate intake of protein only and is associated with oedema, abdominal swelling and fat accumulation in the liver. Marasmus involves inadequate consumption of both energy and protein. Affected patients look emaciated but have no oedema or abdominal swelling. The term 'protein-energy undernutrition' encompasses both of these clinical scenarios. Technically, malnutrition can mean overnutrition (obesity) or undernutrition, both of which lead to deleterious effects on the body's health. However, in common parlance, malnutrition generally refers to undernutrition. Malnutrition can also include isolated vitamin or mineral deficiencies."

Heart failure due to a left to right shunt often presents in the first few weeks of life following a fall in pulmonary vascular resistance. The most common cause of a left to right shunt large enough to cause heart failure is a large ventricular septal defect, resulting in unrestricted left to right blood flow, pulmonary hypertension (with a loud P2) and heart failure. Small ventricular septal defects have restricted blood flow across the ventricular septum, giving rise to a loud murmur, but limited left to right blood flow. Atrial septal defects and a patent ductus arteriosus rarely present with heart failure in the neonatal period. Transposition of the arteries is a duct dependant lesion and presents shortly after birth with severe cyanosis and collapse as the duct closes."

It is different from psychogenic pain as the pain here is real. It is also different from andquot;normalandquot; pain as the characteristics of the pain are not consistent with the evoking factor.  Some chemotherapy agents are well known to cause peripheral neuropathy and hence neuropathic pain. Peripheral neuropathy at the ankle region leads to the burning sensation as the nerves are not functioning normally. This is very different from psychogenic pain or school phobia when the patient makes-up symptoms to get excuses for not going to school. Chemotherapy can also cause rickets which can present with bone pain rather than burning sensation, and will be provoked rather than relieved by walking or standing. Nociceptive pain is the pain which is caused by a stimulus consistent with the pain-feeling, that is the 'normal' known kind of pain. "
pediatrics,426,A 6-month-old attends clinic with a history of failure to thrive and constipation. The following laboratory tests are performed:    Sweat test chloride greater than60 mmol/L (normal less than39 mmol/L)   Neonatal blood spot elevated immunoreactive trypsin (greater than99th centile)   Faecal elastase low (less than100 µg/g stool; normal greater than200 µg)    What is the diagnosis?,Adrenal insufficiency,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Cystic fibrosis,Immunoglobulin A deficiency,Thyroxine deficiency,C,"An elevated chloride level in sweat to the level described, combined with the clinical context, strongly suggests a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis. It should be confirmed by mutation testing. It is caused by recessive mutations in the CFTR gene. One in 25 Europeans are carriers and 1 in 2500 are affected by cystic fibrosis. The CFTR encodes a chloride channel. Loss of function of CFTR prevents chloride from being absorbed from the sweat in the sweat duct back into the cells. This leads to elevated chloride in the sweat. A positive result for cystic fibrosis entails two results on separate days. Diagnosis can be confirmed by genetic testing. Adrenal insufficiency may present with failure to thrive and it can cause a false positive sweat test, but the elevated immunoreactive trypsin on the newborn blood spot is not a feature, but is a feature of cystic fibrosis. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a complication of chronic asthma and the clinical picture is not consistent with this. Selective Immunoglobulin A (IgA) deficiency^1 is defined as a primary immunodeficiency characterised by an undetectable level of IgA in the blood and secretions, but no other immunoglobulin deficiencies. Around 1 in 500 white people are affected and the majority are asymptomatic. Only 25-50% come to medical attention, because of chronic respiratory infection or diarrhoea. Failure to thrive is not well recognised. Diagnosis is by showing deficiency of blood IgA with normal levels of other antibodies. It should be noted that this can lead to false negative anti-endomysial tests for coeliac disease. They have an increased risk of autoimmune disease such as rheumatoid arthritis. There is no available treatment for IgA deficiency. Thyroxine deficiency can cause a false positive sweat test. It may also cause failure to thrive, but a characteristic facial appearance is usually present. Other causes of a false positive sweat test are:  mineralocorticoid drugs starvation ectodermal dysplasia glycogen storage disease G6PD deficiency, and skin rashes.  "
pediatrics,427,Hearing aids and cochlear implants are devices used by people with a hearing loss. Which of the following statements regarding these devices is NOT true?,A cochlear implant may be suitable for someone with a bilateral severe to profound hearing loss,Children as young as 6 months of age have received cochlear implants,"For an aging adult hearing aid user with a progressive sensorineural hearing loss, there may come a time when their hearing aids are no longer helpful and they become a cochlear implant candidate",Hearing aids and cochlear implants function in a similar way and are essentially amplifiers of sound,Hearing aids incorporate sophisticated computer technology to help filter out background noise,D,"A hearing aid consists of a microphone, an amplifier and an earphone. More recent technology has enabled some manipulation of the input sound such as filtering of background noise.The incoming sound is amplified and delivered to the outer ear and hence the normal anatomical and physiological mechanisms of hearing are relied upon. Aids are helpful in providing higher levels of sound to people with a mild to moderate loss, and in some cases of moderate to severe loss. A cochlear implant is not an amplifier, or a andquot;powerful hearing aidandquot;. It artificially recreates sound by providing direct electrical stimulation via electrodes situated in the cochlear. The mechanisms of the outer and middle ear are bypassed. A speech processor (the external component) detects the sound via a microphone, the useful sound is extracted and changed into a radio frequency signal which is transmitted through the skin. The internal portion detects this signal and decodes it, providing stimulation to the appropriate electrode for a given frequency of sound. For severe-profoundly hearing impaired people, the cochlear implant provides not only more sound but clarity of sound. For these people, a hearing aid often only provides amplified noise and little useful sound. Many long term hearing aid users with a progressive hearing loss, or whose hearing suddenly worsens, go on to receive a cochlear implant and receive great benefit. "
pediatrics,428,"A 14-year-old boy presents to the Emergency department with facial swelling, and cough of two weeks duration. He was previously well and had no past medical history of note. The patient is febrile. Examination of the boy reveals non tender, periorbital, and facial oedema bilaterally. ENT examination is unremarkable. No hepatomegaly was found and no peripheral oedema was noted. What of hte following would be most likely to provide a diagnosis for this patient?",Chest x ray,CT scan of paranasal sinuses,MRI scan of brain,Total serum protein and albumin determination.,Urinanalysis,A,"This patient has oedema in the region of the superior vena cava. Cough in addition to oedema makes superior vena cava syndrome due to mediastinal compression by a tumour, which in this age group is likely to be caused by a lymphoma. In nephritic syndrome, periorbital oedema occurs early in the disease, dependant oedema occurs in ambulatory patients. Low protein states as in liver disease also cause peripheral oedema. Ethmoid sinusitis causes periorbital oedema but not facial oedema."
pediatrics,429,"A 2-year-old boy fell off his tricycle and hurt his arm. He got up to start crying, but before there was any sound, he went pale, unconscious and rigid. He recovered after 1-2 minutes but remained pale. After an hour he was back to normal. His mother says she was afraid he was going to die, and that he had a similar episode 3 months prior after falling down some steps. What single investigation is indicated?",CT head,EEG,CBC,None,Skeletal survey,D,"Diagnosis is breath-holding spells. Breath-holding spells are the occurrence of episodic apnea in children, possibly associated with loss of consciousness, and changes in postural tone. Breath-holding spells occur in approximately 5% of the population with equal distribution between males and females. They are most common in children between 6 and 18 months and usually not present after 5 years of age. They are unusual before 6 months of age. A positive family history can be elicited in 25% of cases.Breath-holding spells usually occur when a young child is angry, frustrated, in pain, or afraid"
pediatrics,430,Which of the following is a cause of hypoadrenalism?,Hughes' syndrome (anti-phospholipid antibody),McArdle's syndrome,MEN type 2a,Pendred's syndrome,Von Hippel-Lindau,A,The anti-phospholipid syndrome is one of the commoner causes of Hypoadrenalism and may precipitate adrenal infarction and haemorrhage through adrenal vein thrombosis.
pediatrics,431,Which of the following is correct concerning cystic fibrosis?,Has a gene frequency in the population of 1:50,Infection with Burkholderia cepacia is not transmissible,Is an x-linked recessive condition,The commonest pathogens responsible for respiratory disease are Pseudomonas and Staph. aureus,The mutation responsible for CF is found on chromosome 17,D,"Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive condition, with the most common mutation being δF508 located on chromosome 7 (gene map locus 7q31.2). It is one of the most common mutations in the western world with a gene frequency of approximately 1 in 22. It is associated with meconium ileus, pancreatic dysfunction, recurrent respiratory tract infections and infertility in males to name but a few. Recurrent and chronic respiratory tract infections in patients with cystic fibrosis result in progressive lung damage and are the primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Infections are usually caused by Gram-negative organisms especially the pseudomonads including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Burkholderia cepacia has emerged as a pathogen in patients with CF that may lead to rapid deterioration of lung function. Infection with B. cepacia may be highly transmissible in CF patients and epidemics have been described in a number of CF centres. Staph. aureus is also an important pathogen in children."
pediatrics,432,"A 12-year-old patient came to the OPD with complains of fever, malaise, weight loss, anorexia andproductive cough. Examination: temperature 39C, pulse 100bpm. His mother says that he has a history of recurrent chest infections and he is not thriving well. What is the single most likely causativeorganism?",Pneumococcal pneumonia,Staphylococcus,Mycobacterium TB,Pseudomonas,PCP,B,"In younger age Staphylococcus and by 18 years of age, 80% of patients with classic CF (cystic fibrosis) harbor P. aeruginosa, and 3.5% harbor B. cepacia"
pediatrics,433,A 6-year-old girl who attends a normal school is referred to the clinic because she is short. Her height is 4 cm below the third centile for age and her weight 1 kg below the third centile. Her bone age is 4.2 years. Her mother's and father's heights are on the 25^th and 50^th centiles respectively. Which one of the following statements correctly applies?,A thyroid profile should immediately be requested,Findings of poorly felt femoral pulses suggest that chromosome analysis might be required,From these measurements the child is failing to grow,Physical measurements are compatible with growth hormone deficiency,Physiological (constitutional) short stature is unlikely,B,A history of delayed growth and puberty in the family should be elicited. One single measurement of growth is not sufficient to indicate growth hormone deficiency or thyroid disease. Poorly felt femoral pulses suggest coarctation and Turner's. Constitutional short stature is the most commonly encountered reason. Another growth measurement is required to assess growth velocity.
pediatrics,434,"A 10-year-old child with Down's syndrome presents with chronic cough. He was diagnosed at birth and has always been a difficult feeder, with such frequent vomiting that mother keeps his bibs on even between meals. On examination he is well below the third centile for weight and head circumference. He looks underweight, His chest is hyperinflated and he has coarse crackles symmetrically. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Asthma,Bronchiectasis,Chronic aspiration,Sinusitis,D,"The picture suggests significant gastro-oesophageal reflux, associated with chronic aspiration and failure to thrive. Assessment is often difficult in children with developmental delay because of lack of cooperation with investigations. Medical treatment is with:  antacids, e.g. Gaviscon prokinetics, e.g. domperidone, and acid suppression, e.g. ranitidine, omeprazole.  Surgical fundoplication may be necessary in resistant cases."
pediatrics,435,"An ex-26 week gestation is transferred back to the local district general hospital at 6 weeks of age for continuing care. As part of the routine admission, surface swabs are taken at the umbilicus, nose and ear. The results show the baby is MRSA positive. The parents are very upset. What should you now tell the parents?",Antibiotics sensitive to MRSA need to be administered such as vancomycin,Eradication therapy will be commenced and the baby kept isolated,The baby has a higher risk of sepsis,The baby has MRSA infection,They should stop worrying as everything you read in the papers is blown out of proportion,B,"This baby has MRSA positive surface swabs. It is important to explain to parents the difference between being colonised as in this case and infection. The bacteria are on the baby's skin and caused by Staphylococcus aureus which is in this case is resistant to methicillin. The baby will undergo eradication therapy, as the bacteria can be harmful if it penetrates the blood. Therefore the baby will have antibacterial washes and cream to apply to the nasal area. The baby will also be kept isolated and when they are handling the staff will use aprons and gloves. The baby will have repeat swabs on a regular basis to ensure the eradication is successful."
pediatrics,436,A 15-year-old girl has been to a party with some friends. They arrive by ambulance in the Emergency department after they found her slumped by the toilet surround by empty blister packets of paracetamol tablets and a bottle of wine nearby. You initiate resuscitation measures and inform the child that you will be informing her parents. She has barely regained consciousness when she tells you that she does not wish her parents to be called. What should you do in relation to her parents?,Call her parents,Completely respect her wishes,Contact social services and let them inform her parents,Wait until her blood alcohol levels drop and then try and convince her to let you inform her parents,Wait until the following day to inform her parents,A,"This is a difficult situation as, at 15 years of age, a child may be Gillick/Fraser competent and able to understand the consequences of their decisions. However this ruling related only to the consent to procedures or treatments and not to the refusal. In addition in the scenario above it is implied that the child is seriously ill and there is scope for the situation to deteriorate. Although ideally the parents should be contacted in conjunction with the child's 'approval' in this case it is essential you do so regardless of her wishes and it would not be appropriate here to wait the time it would take for her blood alcohol levels to drop, (which would probably mean waiting until the following morning) so that you can talk to her."
pediatrics,437,"You are the on call doctor working on the neonatal unit. You are called to attend a forceps delivery for a fetal bradycardia. On arrival the CTG monitor reads a fetal heart beat of 60 beats per minute. The baby is delivered and rushed to you at the resuscitaire. He is pale blue and floppy with no respiratory effort, he does not grimace or cry and his heart rate is approximately 50 bpm. You give him five inflation breaths using the t-piece on the resuscitaire, there is an improvement in heart rate so you keep giving him ventilation breaths. By five minutes he is pink in colour with a heart rate of greater than100 beats per minute, however he remains floppy and still has not cried, you have heard occasional gasps and seen him grimace a few times but there is no regular respiration. You continue to give him inflation breaths and contemplate intubating him.  What is his Apgar score at five minutes?",5,6,7,8,9,B,"The Apgar score is a general assessment of how a newborn infant is at one minute and five minutes of age. This score can be continued to 10 minutes, 15 minutes and 20 minutes of age as well if the Apgar score is low.  The Apgar score covers five areas each of which is scored a maximum of 2 points: Colour:  Pink throughout = 2 points Pink centrally but blue peripherally = 1 point Blue/white throughout = 0 points  Tone:  Good tone = 2 points Reduced tone, some flexion of extremities = 1 points Absent tone, limp/floppy = 0 points  Heart rate  greater than100 bpm = 2 points 1 to 99 bpm = 1 point No heart beat = 0 points  Respiratory effort  Regular respirations = 2 points Gasping breaths but no regular respiratory effort = 1 point No respiratory effort = 0 points  Reflex response:  Spontaneous crying = 2 points Occasional grimace = 1 point No reflex response = 0 points  At five minutes this infant scores 2 for heart rate and colour, 1 for respiratory effort and reflex response and 0 for tone."
pediatrics,438,"A full term 3.50 kg baby, Apgar score 7 at one minute, develops abdominal distension and bile-stained vomiting on the first day of life. Which of the following is true?","If the baby has not passed meconium, meconium ileus is unlikely to be the diagnosis",It is important to examine the facial features of the baby in making a diagnosis,Neonatal necrotising enterocolitis is a likely diagnosis,Pyloric stenosis is the most likely diagnosis,Rectal examination will not yield any useful information,B,"This question relates to a scenario of small bowel obstruction. Obstruction may be complete or partial, with complete obstructions leading to more dramatic presentations. High obstructive lesions tend to be associated with vomiting, and in this case the vomit is bile stained, suggesting the obstruction is distal to the ampulla of Vater. Lower lesions tend to lead to abdominal distension and constipation. Congenital causes of duodenal obstruction include:  Duodenal atresia Malrotation Duodenal webs, and Annular pancreas.  Duodenal atresia is the most common of these lesions, and frequently is found in patients with Down syndrome. It is therefore important to examine the facial features of the baby. Neonatal necrotising enterocolitis is unlikely. Its cause is unknown. It primarily affects premature or low birth weight infants. Clinical manifestations include:  Abdominal distension Gastric retention, and Bloody stools in the first two weeks of life.  Meconium impaction may cause an ileus and intestinal obstruction."
pediatrics,439,"A 14-year-old child who has complex partial epilepsy is treated with phenytoin. He is admitted with Campylobacter gastroenteritis, is severely dehydrated, has a urea of 11 mmol/l, and a creatinine of 220 µmol/l. He complains of symptoms of dizziness, ataxia and diplopia. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?",Impaired hepatic metabolism of phenytoin,Impaired phenytoin excretion,Increased phenytoin absorption,Increased phenytoin tissue binding,Reduced phenytoin plasma protein binding,E,"Drugs which are highly protein bound such as phenytoin and warfarin can see a significant increase in the free versus bound component when there is an acute deterioration in renal function. Many assays only measure total drug concentration, as such this may remain in the normal range, although effects of toxicity may be seen. Phenytoin is metabolised in the liver; we are given no indication of impaired hepatic metabolism in this case, and impaired renal function also has no significant impact on total levels for this reason. Renal impairment does not impact on absorption of phenytoin, nor does it increase tissue binding."
pediatrics,440,"A 14-day-old 28 week gestation infant in the neonatal unit has started to have temperature instability. Three days ago he was weaned off the ventilator onto CPAP and was tolerating this well, however over the last 12 hours he has had multiple desaturations and bradycardias. He currently has a long line in situ which has been present for 10 days. His admission MRSA screen was negative but one of the swabs did show a growth of Enterococcus. His endotracheal tube tip from three days ago showed a moderate growth of Acinetobacter. His UVC and UAC tips removed 10 days previously grew Candida. There is a baby in the unit who is currently being barrier nursed for MRSA colonisation, the source of which appears to be the infected c-section wound of the mother. A preliminary blood culture result at 12 hours shows a Gram positive cocci. You start treatment with flucloxacillin and gentamicin but he continues to deteriorate over the next 24 hours. What is the most likely hospital acquired pathogen?",Acinetobacter,Candida,Enterococcus,MRSA,Staphylococcus aureus,D,"It is important to be aware that all of the above are possible sources of infection in an immunocompromised preterm neonate such as described above. The blood culture result has grown Gram positive cocci at 12 hours which is a significant result. Enterococcus is less likely as it was picked up on a surface swab incidentally 14 days previously, also Enterococci are Gram positive Diplococci which would be evident on the initial report. Acinetobacter is a Gram negative rod. Candida is a fungus and would not appear as Gram positive cocci. Staphylococcus aureus is a possibility due to the presence of a long line for 10 days but as flucloxacillin has made no improvement to his condition in 24 hours and he continues to deteriorate it is more likely the cause is MRSA."
pediatrics,441,"A 2-month-old baby presents with apnoea and a three day history of cough. On examination respiratory rate is 40 bpm, heart rate is 120 bpm, oxygen saturations are 96%, examination reveals generalised crepitations and rhonchi. CXR reveals patchy atelectasis.

The chest x ray and high lymphocyte count also support the diagnosis. Group A streptococcal infection does not cause the chest x ray findings and the high lymphocyte count. Group B streptococcal infection causes pneumonia, high fever, feeding difficulties and predominant respiratory and systemic manifestations in the neonatal period. The minimal symptoms of cough, apnoea with no respiratory distress and fever, is against the diagnosis along with the predominant lymphocyte count. Respiratory syncitial virus may produce similar symptoms to pertussis, but symptoms of cough alone and minimal chest signs suggest that pertussis is more likely. High lymphocyte count supports the diagnosis of pertussis."
pediatrics,442,Which one of the following statements applies to congenital adrenal hyperplasia?,Boys more commonly present at an earlier age than girls,Hypotension is invariably present,It always presents shortly after birth,It is commonly associated with genital pigmentation,It is most frequently caused by 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency,D,"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia may present in teenagers with oligo/amenorrhoea and hirsutism without significant virilisation and is termed late onset CAH. Girls present earlier because of virilisation and ambiguous genitalia, boys may present with precocious puberty. It is most commonly caused by 21 hydroxylase deficiency and genital pigmentation is due to high circulating adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency can cause virilisation with hypertension."

pediatrics,444,"A 15-year-old girl presents with a history of a daily headache for three weeks. The headache is pulsatile and most severe in the morning. Pain killers like paracetamol and ibuprofen were effective but not anymore. Clinical exam revealed a well-looking girl, obese with a BMI 34 kg/m^2, and nothing else of note. Nevertheless, fundoscopy revealed bilateral oedema. MRI revealed mild ventricular dilatation with no masses. What is the next step in the management plan?",Arrange for a meeting with the school,Azithromycin for 3 days,Measure the CSF pressure,Stop all medications for 1 week,Trial of zolmitriptan,C,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The main presentation is headache due to a space-occupying lesion. Nevertheless, the CT or MRI will show no lesions. Symptoms may be limited to headache, but patients can suffer from visual disturbances, tinnitus, retrobulbar pain, diplopia, and others. Risk factors include obesity, female sex, and otitis media. The pathophysiology of IIH is unclear, but the most widely accepted theory is the increased arterial inflow. There are several indicators for IIH, such as increased severity after laying down or sleeping, which will increase the intracranial pressure by comparison with standing. In addition, papilloedema and ventricular dilatation are other signs of intracranial hypertension. Diagnosis is confirmed by measuring the CSF pressure. Arranging a meeting with the school may be required in patients with tension-type headache. Azithromycin can be used in cases of chronic bacterial sinusitis. Stopping the medications to rule out medication overuse headache is not justified because such patients are usually barbiturate users. In addition, the cause of headache of this patient is known. Zolmitriptan is an anti-migraine medication. "

He is alert and eager for food but exhibits a loss of skin elasticity and has apparent distension in the left hypochondrium. Which of the following statements is correct for this patient?,He has hyperosmolar dehydration,"He should be started on an anticholinergic drug before feeds, e.g. Atropine Methylnitrate (Eumydrin)",Initial fluid replacement should comprise normal saline 10-20 ml/kg in one hour,Metabolic acidosis would be anticipated,The most likely diagnosis is hiatus hernia,C,"The most likely diagnosis is pyloric stenosis, which is more common in males (4:1 male:female ratio)and characteristically presents 3-6 weeks after birth. This situation will cause a proportionate loss of fluid and electrolytes. Characteristically he will have hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. Initial resuscitation should be with normal saline, at twice the maintenance volume. This will ensure he is volume replete and prevent secondary activation of the renin/aldosterone system, which would cause more alkalosis and hypokalaemia. Once volume replete, the fluid can be changed to half strength saline with added potassium. Although there are a few emerging reports showing satisfactory short term and long term outcome with medical treatment, the preferred treatment is currently pylorotomy. This should be performed after successful resuscitation and electrolyte correction."

Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar, used by the body to build connective tissue. Sufferers lack enzyme to break these down, consequently they build up in the cells and damage them. Excess secretions of dermatan and heparin sulphates occur in the urine.

pediatrics,455,Which condition requires surgical management in the neonatal period?,Cavernous haemangioma,Hirschsprung's disease,Non-retractile prepuce,Tongue tie,Umbilical hernia,B,"The neonatal period is the first four weeks of a child's life. Cavernous haemangiomas (strawberry naevi) are common and only very rarely require treatment with surgery. Most enlarge over the next few months and then subsequently regress. Hirschsprung's disease presenting in the neonatal period requires surgical management with either resection of the aganglionic segment or formation of a colostomy proximal to the affected segment. Surgery may be delayed if the gut can be kept decompressed by regular rectal washouts or rectal stimulation. The foreskin is non-retractile in the immediate newborn period and traumatic forced retraction may predispose to later phimosis by causing scarring. Tongue tie or short frenulum requires surgical treatment in only the most extreme cases and otherwise parental reassurance is all that is required. Umbilical hernias are common and usually resolve by the first year of age. Paediatric umbilical hernias require surgery if they are greater than 1.5 cm, develop complications, or fail to spontaneously resolve by the age of 4 or 5 years. They are very rarely repaired in the neonatal period."
pediatrics,456,An 18-month-old boy is referred urgently to hospital after his blood results show that he has acute renal failure. What is the most common cause of acute renal failure in children less than 2 years of age?,Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Posterior urethral valves,Trauma,Wilms' tumour,B,"Haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) is the commonest cause of acute renal failure in children, particularly those less than 2 years of age. Diarrhoea associated HUS is the commonest type, usually as a result of Escherichia coli 0157. Toxin is released in the gut and absorbed, causing endothelial damage, especially in renal microvasculature, leading to microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with thrombocytopenia and red blood cell fragmentation. Treatment is supportive, avoid antibiotics and antimotility agents; as motility slows, the gut is exposed to the toxins for a longer period of time and antibiotic induced injury to the bacterial membrane favours the acute release of large amounts of toxins. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease can present with acute renal failure but it is rare. Likewise, trauma can cause pre-renal failure via haemorrhage but is also a rare cause of acute renal failure. Posterior urethral valves are the most common cause of post-renal (obstructive) renal failure but it is progressive and does not usually cause acute failure. Similarly, Wilms' tumour does not usually cause acute failure."
pediatrics,457,"A 16-year-old boy visits your practice nurse after acquiring an open wound on his left leg whilst playing rugby. Examination of the wound reveals a dirty 6 cm wound containing soil. With regard to tetanus vaccination, which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",If he has received three doses of tetanus toxoid and the last booster was more than 10 years ago he should receive a further three dose course tetanus vaccine,If he previously received three doses of tetanus vaccine no immunisation for tetanus is required,If his immunisation status is uncertain he should receive tetanus immunoglobulin,"If the immunisation status is unclear, he should receive tetanus toxoid only",If the last booster dose of tetanus was within the last 10 years then he should receive a further booster,C,"With regard to tetanus vaccination, if an individual who has received a full five course of tetanus vaccine suffers a tetanus prone wound, then no further doses of vaccine are recommended. There is contention over giving TIG to individuals who are known to be fully immunised. Some sources say yes for all high risk wounds whereas others say only if five years have elapsed since the last dose. "
pediatrics,458,"A newborn baby, one of twins born at term, is noted to be centrally cyanosed soon after birth. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",Coarction of the aorta,Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA),Transposition of great arteries,Tricuspid atresia,Ventricular septal defect (VSD),C,"Coarctation of the aorta is not associated with cyanosis. PDA and VSD are left to right shunts. Tricuspid atresia and transposition of the great arteries are both cyanotic congenital heart diseases and present in the immediate newborn period. Of the two, transposition of the great arteries is more common and hence more likely to be the cause."
pediatrics,459,A child had a patchy rash following treatment for sore throat & cervical LN enlargement. Which is the most likely antibiotic?,Ampicillin,Erythromycin,Cefuroxime,Metronidazole,Tetracycline,A,Infectious mononeucleosis can present with sorethroat and lymphadenothy like tonsillitis and if treated with ampicillin leads to eruption of patchy rashes
pediatrics,460,Which one of the following skills would be expected of a 7-month-old infant but not of a 5-month-old infant?,Controls bowel and bladder,Crawls,Raises head while prone,Sits unsupported,Smiles socially,D,"Neither 5 or 7-month-old infant could crawl or control bowel and bladder. Both would be expected to be able to smile and raise head whilst prone. However, the acquisition of sitting unsupported should be achieved by 7 months."
pediatrics,461,"A 7-year-old girl with Down's syndrome has central cyanosis. Examination of her chest shows only a soft mid-systolic murmur at the apex, and in her abdomen there is a well-healed scar in the epigastrium dating from the newborn period. Which of the following is most likely?",Arterial blood gases show CO2 retention,Dental extraction should be covered by antibiotic prophylaxis,Her haematocrit is likely to be 30%,She has Eisenmenger's syndrome,The newborn period is likely to have been complicated by Hirschsprung's disease,D,"Most probably she will have secondary polycythaemia and a raised haematocrit. She most likely has Eisenmenger's syndrome secondary to a reversed AVSD or VSD shunt. She has cyanotic heart disease and the blood gases will show hypoxia rather than CO2 retention. Hirschsprung's disease (congenital aganglionic megacolon) occurs more frequently in patients with Down syndrome but it is still a relatively uncommon development. Duodenal atresia may have occurred. NICE guidelines state only those with the following cardiac conditions should be considered at increased risk of infective endocarditis:  acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation valve replacement structural congenital heart disease, including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect or fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus, and closure devices that are judged to be endothelialised previous infective endocarditis, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  "
pediatrics,462,A 4-year-old boy presents because his mother is concerned she cannot retract his foreskin and when he passes urine his foreskin balloons and he sprays urine. On examination he has a non-retractile foreskin. What is the most appropriate treatment option?,Antibiotics,Circumcision,Preputioplasty,Topical steroids,Watchful waiting,E,"It is normal for a 4-year-old not to be able to retract his foreskin, with time it will nearly always retract by the age of 7. Antibiotics are not indicated as there is no suggestion of infection; often boys with non-retractile foreskins experience inflammation in their prepuce but this is usually a chemical irritation due to trapped urine rather than infection. The medical indications for circumcision are recurrent balanitis or a pathological phimosis such as balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO). Topical steroids can help a non-retractile foreskin become retractile but as this boy is essentially asymptomatic this is unnecessary."
pediatrics,463,"A 4-year-old girl presents with fever and ear pain. She has had a cold for three days, but over the past 24 hours she has been pulling at her right ear. She was born at term weighing 3.8 kg and there were no neonatal problems. She is on no medications, has no known allergies and is fully immunised. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a temperature of 38.47°C, with shotty tender neck nodes. Respiratory rate is 20/min and pulse is 100/min. Her right eardrum is red and bulging. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Group A streptococcal pharyngitis,Mastoiditis,Otitis media with effusion,"Otitis media, acute","Otitis media, recurrent",D,"The history suggests an acute otitis media complicating an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). A wide variety of organisms may be responsible, but pneumococcus is the commonest. If you were to treat with antibiotics, initial therapy is with amoxicillin, with co-amoxiclav or cefuroxime for non-responding cases. Otitis media with effusion usually presents with hearing loss over a prolonged period.   "
pediatrics,464,"A 14-year-old boy presents with chronic cough. It began following a cold in the wintertime, but has persisted since. It is worst in the daytime, and disappears completely overnight. On examination he is cheerful and well and there are no abnormalities to find. He clears his throat continuously and is on the 50th centile for height and weight. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Asthma,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,Habit cough,Pertussis,D,The prolonged history of cough in a thriving child with symptoms that disappear during sleep stongly suggest a habit cough. This should settle rapidly with reassurance.
pediatrics,465,An 18-month-old boy investigated for failure to thrive and delayed development is found to have primary hypothyroidism. Which of the following statements applies to his condition?,Growth hormone deficiency is likely also to be associated,Hashimoto's disease is the most likely cause,He is more prone to develop parathyroid insufficiency,He is unlikely to achieve normal intelligence despite immediate commencement of appropriate treatment,If his bone age was 3 months the onset of his hypothyroid state is most likely to have occurred at 3 months of age,D,"The diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism has been delayed and hence thyroxine therapy will not restore mental function fully. The hypothyroidism is likely to have been present at birth. Growth hormone deficiency may be seen in association with secondary hypothyroidism if pituitary insufficiency exists, but not in primary hypothyroidism. Untreated hypothyroidism is associated with dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease. Hypoparathyroidism is unrelated. The most likely aetiology is absent or ectopic thyroid."
pediatrics,466,Which one of the following conditions is transmitted by means of an X-linked recessive inheritance?,Cystic fibrosis,Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Facio-humero-scapular dystrophy,Galactosaemia,Huntington’s chorea,B,Cystic fibrosis and galactosaemia are autosomal recessively inherited conditions. Haemophilia and Duchenne muscular dystrophy are X- linked recessive and facio-humeroscapular dystrophy and Huntington's chorea are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.
pediatrics,467,"A 17-year-old man has acute pain and earache on the right side of his face. Temperature 38.4C and has extensive pre-auricular swelling on the right, tender on palpation bilaterally. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Acute mastoiditis,Acute otitis externa,Acute OM,Mumps,OM with effusion,D,"C/F: prodromal malaise, increased temperature, painful parotid swelling, becoming bilateral in 70%"
pediatrics,468,A 9-year-old girl is about to begin induction chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. She is pre-dosed with rasburicase in an attempt to reduce her serum uric acid. Which of the following correctly reflects the mode of action of rasburicase?,Increases uric acid excretion,Inhibition of macrophage migration,Oxidation of uric acid,Xanthine oxidase activator,Xanthine oxidase inhibitor,C,"The answer is oxidation of uric acid. Rasburicase is recombinant urate oxidase, leading to metabolism of uric acid to allantoin and water. It is delivered intravenously and results in a rapid reduction of uric acid levels. Given it is a protein however, injection reactions may occur. Colchicine is thought to inhibit macrophage migration, and hence inflammation and allopurinol is an inhibitor of xanthine oxidase."
pediatrics,469,"An 11-year-old girl presents with a six-month history of progressive unsteadiness. In the past month, her speech has become less comprehensible. There is no past medical history of note except short-sightedness for which she wears glasses. On examination, she has horizontal nystagmus and truncal instability in addition to past pointing. There is a small telangiectasia patch of 1 cm diameter on her abdomen. Deep tendon reflexes are absent, Romberg's sign is positive and she failed to elicit two-point discrimination. Cardiovascular exam revealed a hyperdynamic pulse with an ejection systolic murmur. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Ataxia telangiectasia,Friedreich's ataxia,Phenytoin toxicity,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Vitamin E deficiency,B,"Friedreich's ataxia, first described in 1863 by Nikolaus Friedreich, is the most common autosomal recessive ataxic disorder. It is a degenerative disorder affecting the myelinated nerve fibers and the muscle fibers. It affects the peripheral nerves, spinal cord and ganglia. The disease progression is gradual and it involves all of the peripheral nervous system; it can be described as andquot;dying back phenomenaandquot; of axons. The onset of Friedreich's ataxia is less than25 years with a mean of 11-12 years old; this is a weak clue for the diagnosis which is further supported by the other signs and symptoms. Sensory involvement (positive Romberg's sign) and absent tendon reflexes, with an ejection systolic murmur (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), are other diagnostic factors. The presence of isolated telangiectasia can be a normal finding. In addition, the onset of ataxia telangiectasia is in the early childhood. There are no risk factors for phenytoin toxicity or vitamin deficiencies. "
pediatrics,470,The healthy 14-day-old term infant has a requirement of how many kilocalories (kcal) per kilogram of their body weight per 24 hours?,50 kCal/Kg,100 kCal/Kg,150 kCal/Kg,200 kCal/Kg,250 kCal/Kg,B,"The average, healthy 0-3-month-old infant has a daily calorie requirement of 100 kCal/Kg. Their daily fluid requirement is 150 ml/Kg and their protein requirement is 2.1 g/Kg. Standard newborn infant formula contains approximately 65-70 kCal/100ml (maternal breast milk is 67 kCal/100ml), therefore if their milk requirement is calculated at 150 ml/Kg this works out at approximately 100 kCal/Kg."
pediatrics,471,"An 8-year-old Saudi boy, known to have sickle cell disease, presents to Accident and Emergency with severe abdominal pain associated with vomiting. This pain began yesterday with the right shoulder and increased in severity today. Clinical exam revealed an anxious child who is in severe pain, lying still on his side. He refuses to change his position when you ask him to and refuses to be touched because of tenderness. Investigations reveal:    White blood cell count 7 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Haemoglobin 101 g/L (90-135)   Platelets 120 ×10^9/L (150-400)   C-reactive protein 38 mg/L (less than5)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (133-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatine 61 mmol/L (60-110)   Alanine transaminase (ALT) 34 U/L (0-40)   Aspartate aminotransferase (ASP) 38 U/L (0-40)   Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 403 IU/L (70-400)   Amylase 140 U/L (less than90)   Bilirubin 110 µmol/L (less than21)    Which of the following is the mostly likely diagnosis in this patient?",Acute appendicitis,Acute cholecystitis,Acute pancreatitis,Acute splenic sequestration,Sickle cell crisis,B,"Acute cholecystitis is very rare in children compared with adults. Nevertheless, it can be present in diseases where there is chronic destruction of the blood cells, such as sickle cell disease, thalassaemia, and spherocytosis. This will eventually lead to the formation of bile stones, which may remain asymptomatic, but it can lead to acute cholecystitis. This patient has had one symptom characteristic to cholecystitis, which is shoulder pain, in addition to the high levels of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. Gallstones can also lead to acute pancreatitis but the amylase should triple to consider this. In sickle cell crisis and splenic sequestration, there will be a precipitous drop of haemoglobin."
pediatrics,472,"A 9-year-old boy presents with a seizure. His eyes roll upwards, then he becomes stiff, then he shakes all four limbs for four minutes. He gradually goes blue, froths at the mouth, and is incontinent. He had a similar briefer episode on two previous occasions. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he is in a deep sleep, but is apyrexial. Respiratory rate is 13/min and pulse 90/min. Oxygen saturations are 95% in air. His plantars are upgoing and his pupils dilated. Otherwise there is no abnormality to find. What is the most likely seizure type?","Generalised, atonic","Generalised, clonic","Generalised, tonic-clonic",Partial with secondary generalisation,"Petit mal, atypical",C,"The history is of generalised tonic-clonic seizure lasting four minutes. The diagnosis of epilepsy requires at least three witnessed seizures. Eye-witness accounts are the cornerstone of diagnosis. EEG may be helpful in the classification of seizure type, but may be normal in children with definite epilepsy. Sodium valproate or carbamazepine are first line therapy."
pediatrics,473,Which of the following statements applies to infants with gastroenteritis?,Always develop lactose intolerance,Frequently have blood in their stools,In most instances require treatment with an antibiotic which is not absorbed from the gut,Should be admitted to hospital if they are unable to tolerate fluid orally,Should have a barium meal if the initial refeeding with milk is unsuccessful,D,"The majority of children do not require antibiotics as the cause is viral. Formula feeds should not be changed. Intravenous fluid therapy will be required if they are unable to tolerate oral fluids. Prolonged lactose intolerance can occur, but is not common. Barium meals are not useful in the investigation of gastroenteritis. Blood in the stool is uncommon, and occurs more commonly in bacterial gastroenteritis."
pediatrics,474,"A 4-month-old boy presents with heart murmur, breathlessness and failure to thrive. He has always breathed a little fast, but this has gradually worsened. He has been falling through the centiles. He was born at 40+2/40 weighing 3.22 kg and there were no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.9°C, respiratory rate 40/min (minimal recession) and pulse is 120/min. He is below the 3% for weight and on the 50% for OFC. He has an active praecordium, loud P2 and a 3/6 pansystolic murmur maximal at the lower left sternal edge, but heard all over the praecordium. The liver is 3 cm. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Atrial septal defect, primum","Atrial septal defect, secundum",Mitral regurgitation,Tricuspid atresia,Ventricular septal defect,E,"This history suggests heart failure, worsening over the first few weeks of life, with a pansystolic murmur. This suggests a VSD causing haemodynamically significant left-to-right shunt. The shunt volume usually increases in the first few weeks as the pulmonary vascular resistance drops. The murmur goes from ejection systolic in the first few days, gradually becoming pansystolic. Diuretics are often needed. Some VSDs (particularly of the muscular septum) close spontaneously. Others (especially of the membranous septum) require surgical closure. "
pediatrics,475,Which of the following is true of fractures in children?,Angulation and displacement of fractures are poorly tolerated,Bone is generally more brittle,Healing is usually prolonged,Stiffness of adjacent joints is common following fracture immobilisation,The periosteum is thicker and more highly developed,E,"Fractures in children usually heal quicker than similar fractures in adults. The bone is more elastic. Due to the remodelling potential of paediatric fractures angulation and displacement, if not excessive, are usually well tolerated. Immobilisation of fractures is also well tolerated in general. The periosteum in children is thick and can often be used as an aid to hold reduction."
pediatrics,476,A 2-year-old boy was brought into the Emergency department after he had jerky movements of his arms and legs for 30 seconds and seemed to be unresponsive and was drowsy for several minutes afterwards. On examination he had a temperature of 39°C and red inflamed tonsils. Which would be the best single piece of advice to give the parents?,"About one third of children who have had a febrile seizure will go on to have another one, but the risk of epilepsy in later life is only about 2-3% if no other risk factors","About two thirds of children who have had a febrile seizure will go on to have another one, but the risk of epilepsy in later life is only about 1% if no other risk factors",All children who have had a febrile seizure should be discharged with buccal midazolam,If a child has more than one febrile seizure within a six month period they should be started on a low dose anti-epileptic medication,Paracetamol should be given to reduce the risk of further febrile seizures,A,"Febrile seizures are common, occurring in about 1 in 20 children. Typically they occur aged 6 months to 3 years. The child needs to attend the Emergency department to identify the cause of temperature and any treatment needed. Of children who have had a febrile seizure about one third will have a recurrence, not two thirds. This is especially the case among younger children. Buccal midazolam should not be given without prior resuscitation training. Most febrile seizures are self-limiting and do not require rescue medication. Only about 2-3% who have a febrile seizure actually go on to have epilepsy (compared to approx. 1% of the general population) and most febrile seizures are self-limiting, thus anti-epileptics are rarely required. There is no evidence that antipyretics reduce the risk of subsequent febrile convulsions in at risk children. Prescription of paracetamol following febrile seizures may provide comfort and symptomatic relief, but should not be recommended to prevent further febrile convulsions. "
pediatrics,477,A 4-year-old boy comes to the cardiology clinic for his first check up since having his VSD repaired. His parents are worried as he is due to visit the dentist soon and they cannot remember the advice they were given regarding dental procedures. Which piece of advice should they be given?,"All patients with structural congenital heart disease, except those with an isolated ASD or fully repaired VSD should be offered routine antibiotic prophylaxis before undergoing dental procedures",All patients with structural congenital heart disease should be offered chlorhexidine mouthwash before undergoing dental procedures but do not require routine antibiotic prophylaxis,All patients with structural congenital heart disease should be offered routine antibiotic prophylaxis before undergoing dental procedures,Any patient with a metallic valve replacement should be offered routine antibiotic prophylaxis before undergoing dental procedures,No patient with a congenital cardiac condition should routinely be offered antibiotic prophylaxis for defined interventional procedures,E,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare condition with significant morbidity and mortality. It may arise following bacteraemia in a patient with a predisposing cardiac lesion. In an attempt to prevent this disease, over the past 50 years, at-risk patients have been given antibiotic prophylaxis before dental and certain non-dental interventional procedures. However, recent research has shown that antibiotic prophylaxis has not been proven to be effective. There is no clear association between episodes of infective endocarditis and interventional procedures. Any benefits from prophylaxis need to be weighed against the risk of adverse effects for patient and of antibiotic resistance developing. The NICE guideline recommends that antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer offered routinely for defined interventional procedures. Neither antibiotic prophylaxis nor chlorhexidine mouthwash are indicated prior to any interventional procedure. "
pediatrics,478,A 10-year-old child is found to have neurofibromatosis. Which of the following statements is correct?,Freckling of the back would be expected,Her condition was inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion,She will most probably be mentally retarded,The finding of two café au lait spots in her 6-year-old sibling suggests he may be affected,There may be no family history of the condition,E,"Freckling of the inguinal and axillary regions occur. The condition is autosomal dominant. Mental retardation may be a clinical feature of the condition but is not a usual clinical feature. Six or more café au lait spots before the age of puberty would assist in making a diagnosis, along with other clinical findings such as Lisch nodules, and optic nerve gliomas. Thirty per cent to 50% of new cases are due to spontaneous mutations."
pediatrics,479,"A 4-year-old girl presents with heart murmur and breathlessness. She was well until 7 days ago, when she developed a nasty cold and fever. She has progressively deteriorated.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic coarctation,Atrioventricular canal defect,Kawasaki disease,Myocarditis,Ventricular septal defect,D,"The history is of viral illness followed by heart failure. The likely diagnosis is viral myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. An echocardiogram shows dilated chambers with poor contractility. Treatment is with diuretics and ACE inhibitors. Spontaneous recovery is variable, and transplant may be required."
pediatrics,480,"A neonate boy born at term presents two hours after birth with respiratory distress and cyanosis. A senior nurse already gave oxygen via nasal cannula because the baby was cyanotic with a drop in oxygen saturations. The baby did not improve so you decide to intubate the baby and place on mechanical ventilation support with the following settings:    Rate 60/minute   PIP 25   PEEP 4   O2 100%    Nevertheless, the oxygen saturation did not increase above 85%. He was born at term with no significant perinatal history. On examination, you note central and peripheral cyanosis with respiratory distress. You decide to admit the patient to the neonatal ICU and do arterial blood gases, which were done after 20 minutes of mechanical ventilation. Blood gases:    pH 7.20 (7.35-7.45)   PaCO2 3.1 kPa (4.7-6)   PaO2 10.2 kPa (11.3-12.6)   Bicarbonate 12.4 mmol/L (21-29)   Base excess −6 mmol/L (±2)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cyanotic congenital heart disease,Neonatal pneumonia,Neonatal sepsis,Polycythaemia,Respiratory distress syndrome,A,"Hyperoxic test, also known as Nitrogen Washout test, is a reliable and easy to perform investigation in cases of cyanosis. It is often used in neonatal units. The main purpose of this test is to differentiate between cardiac and respiratory causes of cyanosis. It is performed by giving the patient 100% oxygen for 15 minutes then checking blood gases, which is expected to show an increase in O2 pressure to greater than20 kPa with non-cardiac causes. In this patient, because there is a PaO2 of less than20 kPa after giving 100% oxygen for 15 minutes, the most likely cause of cyanosis is either cyanotic congenital heart disease or severe respiratory compromise. The latter can be excluded by the fact that the PaCO2 is low, indicating a good respiratory function in the removal of CO2 to compensate for the metabolic acidosis caused by tissue hypoxia."
pediatrics,481,"A female infant is born at 24+6/40 weighing 526 g. She has a stormy neonatal course, requiring 14 days ventilation and inotropes for 6 days. This is complicated by grade 3 intraventricular haemorrhage on the left and grade 4 IVH on the right.

pediatrics,483,"Which of the following, if present, would lead you to suspect a newborn child has Down's syndrome?",Aggressive behaviour,Epileptic seizures,Hypertelorism,Hypotonia,"Large, protruding tongue",D,"Hypertelorism is not a feature. A large protruding tongue is a feature of cretinism. Aggressive behaviour is uncommon. Epilepsy is not a feature, but hypotonia occurs commonly."
pediatrics,484,Which of the following is true regarding paediatric abdominal trauma?,A double contrast CT scan is the investigation of choice,A plain abdominal CT scan is indicated only in the absence of cardiovascular instability,A rectal examination is contraindicated,Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) is a commonly performed investigation,"In the presence of hypovolaemia, 4.5% albumin should be used in preference to crystalloids",A,"A double-contrast CT scan of the abdomen (using intravenous and intragastric contrast) is the radiological investigation of choice in children (not a plain CT), but should only be performed if the patients are cardiovascularly stable. Rectal examination should only be performed on children by the operating surgeon, and even then, it should only be done if the results of the examination will affect the management. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) should rarely be used in children, as the presence of intraperitoneal blood per se, is not necessarily an indication for laparotomy. A DPL is considered positive if:  the red cell count is over 100,000/mm^3 the white cell count over 500/mm^3, or enteric contents or bacteria are seen.  Fluid resuscitation is based on boluses of 20 ml/kg of crystalloid, not 4.5% albumin."

What is the most appropriate action you should take for this baby?",Abdominal x ray,Check serum amylase,Give antibiotics,Refer to paediatric surgeons,Suppositories to relieve constipation,D,"This child has features to suggest intussusception. The most appropriate course of action is to refer immediately to a paediatric surgical unit. Approaches to relieve the intussusception will initially entail attempts at air reduction and, if this fails, surgery.

This is one of the most common surgical conditions of the newborn. It results from hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle causing gastric outlet obstruction. The aetiology is unknown, although there are various associated environment factors, such as formula feeding, exposure to erythromycin, and seasonal variation. There is a 7% incidence in children who have a parent who had pyloric stenosis. Diagnosis is via the typical presentation as described above with a palpable olive mass within the upper abdomen, which is the hypertrophied pylorus. Ultrasound is sometimes used to confirm the diagnosis and is defined as a muscle thickness greater than or equal to 4 mm and a pyloric canal length greater or equal to 16 mm. Patients present with the hallmark metabolic derangement of:  Hypochloraemia Hypokalaemia Raised urea +/− creatinine Commonly hyponatraemia Metabolic alkalosis - raised pH and HCO3 Aciduria  Gastric outlet obstruction leads to vomiting and loss of Na, K, Cl, and water. The compensatory response for this is principally renal preservation of Na^− initially with loss of K, and then later loss of H^+ as a cation exchange, hence the paradoxical aciduria. Management involves resuscitation and correction of the electrolyte disturbance, followed by a pyloromyotomy, typically undertaken laparoscopically. "
pediatrics,487,"A 2-year-old child is brought to the paediatric outpatient clinic as her parents are unable to get her to stay asleep at night. Her parents have a routine each night, which they have had since infancy where one of them cuddles her until she falls asleep and then they place her in her bed. At this point she stays asleep for a few hours. Thereafter though she wakes up crying, her parents initially went to her when she cried, but then hoping to resolve the issue stopped responding to her crying. At this point she started getting out of bed when she woke up and coming into their room. It then takes nearly an hour to get her back to sleep again at which point she is placed back in her bed, however this cycle goes on to repeat itself several more times during the night. Her parents have now started letting her sleep with them when she wakes up so that their sleep is less disturbed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Circadian rhythm disorder,Narcolepsy,Night terrors,Separation anxiety disorder,Sleep onset association disorder,E,"In sleep onset association disorder the child has learned to fall asleep under a set of prescribed conditions or associations which their parents have set since infancy (such as rocking or soothing) and so the child has not learned how to self-soothe. Subsequently when the child experiences normal periods of brief arousal (as part of the sleep cycle or for other reasons) during the night they are unable to go back to sleep again without those same conditions being present. This ultimately results in prolonged night wakening and insufficient sleep for both child and parents. Treatment focuses on withdrawal of parental assistance at night or a form of graduated extinction, placement of more appropriate sleep associations (such as a teddy bear) and positive reinforcement. Circadian rhythm disorder and narcolepsy are conditions that tend to affect adolescents more than young children. Separation anxiety disorder presents more as an unwillingness to go to sleep for fear of being away from the primary caregiver or that something may happen to them whilst the child is sleeping. During a night terror the child is often unresponsive to their surrounding environment and there is usually amnesia of the event."
pediatrics,488,"A 15-year-old girl is brought to see you by her mother who is worried about her behaviour. The girl denies there is any problem but her mother mentions that she has become withdrawn, lacks energy, her hair is thinner and thinks she may have lost some weight, but is not sure. You notice unusual marks on her hands. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anorexia nervosa,Bulimia nervosa,Cannabis abuse,Hyperthyroid,Hypothyroid,B,"Bulimia is the most likely diagnosis. Patients generally are of normal weight compared with anorexia when they are very underweight. It is most common in adolescent and young adult females. The disease is characterised by cycles of binge eating and purging (laxatives, exercise, forced vomiting or fasting). Patients will attempt to conceal their eating habits and purging and often deny they are unwell. Presentation varies but commonly patients complain of fatigue, weakness, abdominal pain and menstrual disorder. Examination can reveal evidence of purging:  marks on hands from forced vomiting dental cavities loss of tooth enamel, and enlarged salivary glands.  Examination can also reveal evidence of malnutrition/dehydration:  dry skin thin hair peripheral oedema, and peripheral neuropathy."
pediatrics,489,"A 2-day-old baby is apyrexial, feeding well and has passed urine and meconium. His mother has noticed a transient widespread erythematous rash which has some overlying yellow pustular areas and has asked for advice. What is the most appropriate action?",Reassure that rash will disappear over first two weeks of life; it is transient and self-limiting and no treatment is required,Start empirical antibiotics for 5-7 days,Take a detailed family history and look for associated stigmata of bullous diseases,Take skin swabs and wait for culture results before deciding on antimicrobial therapy,Take temperature every 2 hours and monitor closely for signs of scalded skin syndrome,A,"The rash is typical of erythema neonatorum toxicum, which is transient, self-limiting and requires no treatment. Erythema neonatorum toxicum is a benign, self-limiting rash that occurs only in newborn babies and occurs after 48 hours in almost all cases. It is characterised by small papules or pustules. The papules are usually surrounded by erythematous areas and are transient, coming and going all over the body. The underlying cause is unknown. Because of the distinctive appearance and benign course the diagnosis is usually clear and no investigation or treatment is required. There is no genetic cause of erythema toxicum and it is not connected to any bullous disease (the question is hinting that a differential diagnosis may be epidermolysis bullosa). "
pediatrics,490,"A 6-week-old infant is brought to the Emergency department with a two day history of poor feeding and breathlessness. She was born at term by forceps extraction to a 28-year-old care worker. On arrival she appears quiet and sweaty to touch. Her heart rate is 240 beats per minute with a respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute. Her blood pressure is 75/45 mmHg. She is pink in air but has mild subcostal recession. The heart sounds are dual with no murmur, a capillary refill time of 3 seconds and palpable femoral pulses. Her liver edge is palpable at 3 cms below the costal margin. The initial electrocardiogram shows a narrow complex tachycardia. What is the next most appropriate course of management?",Beta blockers,Intramuscular adenosine,Intravenous diuretics,Septic screen,Vagal manoeuvres,E,"Poor feeding, tachycardia and sweating in a infant could be sepsis, cardiac, respiratory or metabolic in origin. A heart rate of over 200 beats per minute suggests a tachyarrhythmia, rather than just tachycardia. A palpable liver edge also suggests a cardiac cause. The initial course of management should be to terminate the arrhythmia. In the first instance vagal manoeuvres, such as an ice pack on the face, should be attempted. Older children may be able to perform a Valsalva manoeuvre or respond to carotid massage (never done bilaterally). Intravenous adenosine can be used if vagal manoeuvres fail to restore a normal rhythm. Adenonsine is given as a rapid intravenous bolus under continuous ECG monitoring. If adenosine fails or there is cardiovascular instability synchronised DC cardioversion may be required. Following stabilisation blood tests to exclude underlying triggers such as sepsis, anaemia or electrolyte abnormalities should be undertaken. Intravenous diuretics may be required after initial management if heart failure is present. Flecainide or beta-blockers can be used to prevent recurrent episodes of superventricular tachycardia, ideally under supervision of a paediatric cardiologist."

Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he is well and apyrexial. There are no dysmorphic features. Respiratory rate is 17/min and pulse 100/min. He has a split S2 which does not vary with breathing, and 2/6 ejection systolic murmur at the upper left sternal edge. Liver is impalpable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic coarctation,"Atrial septal defect, primum","Atrial septal defect, secundum",Innocent murmur,Pulmonary stenosis,C,"The history of asymptomatic heart murmur, with fixed splitting of the second heart sound and pulmonary flow murmur all point to atrial septal defect (ASD) as the diagnosis here. An ostium primum defect (mild end of the endocardial cushion defect spectrum), often has an associated AV valve leak, VSD or evidence of heart failure. This may be treatable using 'umbrella' closure via a cardiac catheter. Occasionally surgical closure is required if very large or associated with other heart defects. Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer required. "

Maternal age also affects the incidence of hydrocephalus, anencephaly and other chromosomal disorders."
pediatrics,493,Which of the following statements is true about immunological reactions?,Angio-neurotic oedema is the most severe form of type I reaction,Deficiencies in the terminal components of complement increase the risk of meningococcal disease,Graves' Disease is caused by a type IV reaction,Serum sickness is caused by a type II reaction,Urticaria usually responds to Cimetidine,B,"Serum sickness is due to circulating antibody-antigen complexes (Type III). Graves' Disease is due to stimulating antibody (Type V). The most severe variety of Type I reaction is anaphylaxis, with angio-oedema an intermediate reaction associated with wheeze and swelling of the lips and severe urticaria. These reactions are mediated by histamine 1 receptor stimulation. Congenital C1 inhibitor deficiency is also caused hereditary angio-oedema. Deficiencies in C1r, s, and 2-4 result in vasculitidies; while deficiencies in C2, 3 and 5-8 are associated with an increased risk of septicaemia. Copyright "

Which one of the following statements correctly applies to leukaemia in childhood?,Has a peak incidence in children of school age,Meningeal disease can be completely prevented,Relapse on treatment carries a poor prognosis,The prognosis is best in the 10-12 year age group,Treatment for at least five years is essential,C,"The peak incidence is 2 years in females and 3 years in males. Sites of involvement may include testes and meninges, which carry a poor prognosis. Meningeal disease may be prevented by intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial radiotherapy, but not in all cases. Relapse on treatment and male sex carry a poorer prognosis. The prognosis is poor if the age is less than 1 year or greater than 9 years. Treatment is usually for two years in girls and three years in boys."
pediatrics,495,A genotypic male (XY) infant is born with ambiguous genitalia. The testes are retained within the abdomen and the internal reproductive tracts show a normal male phenotype. Which of the following abnormalities would account for this abnormal development?,5-alpha-reductase deficiency,17-alpha-hydroxylase deficiency,Complete androgen insensitivity,Sertoli-only syndrome,Testicular dysgenesis,A,"The differentiation of the Wolffian ducts into normal male internal reproductive tract requires testosterone but not dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, the differentiation of the external genitalia into the male reproductive system does require DHT. Absence of 5-alpha-reductase in the latter will result in feminisation. Untreated patients are phenotypically female and often present at puberty with virilisation a consequence of testosterone surges. Treatment depends upon DHT therapy. "
pediatrics,496,"Which molecule is produced in the nucleus, matures in the cytoplasm, binds to the ribosome and initiates protein synthesis?",Messenger RNA,Ribosomal RNA,RNA nucleotide,RNA polymerase,Transfer RNA,A,"Protein synthesis consists of two phases. Transcription is where one strand of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double helix is used as a template by ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase to synthesise messenger RNA from RNA nucleotides. The mRNA then migrates into the cytoplasm maturing, for example, by the splicing of non-coding sequences. Translation occurs when the ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon and transfer RNA brings amino acids into position along the mRNA template. Ribosomal RNA interacts with transfer RNA during translation by providing peptidyl transferase activity. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA producing a polypeptide sequence. Each type of RNA consists of nucleotides, which are made up of phosphate, ribose sugar and nitrogen bases. RNA polymerase is the enzyme which is responsible for synthesing RNA molecules."
pediatrics,497,"The tuberculin skin test, also known as the Mantoux test, is used to detect whether an individual has been exposed to tuberculosis or has been successfully immunised with BCG. What does a positive tuberculin skin test, with a delayed hypersensitivity reaction, imply about the immune system?",That a cell-mediated immune response has occurred,That a humoral immune response has occurred,That both the T and B cell mediated components of the immune system are functional,That only the B cell mediated components of the immune system are functional,That the child has antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis,A,"A positive tuberculin skin test indicates that the child has already been sensitised to the antigens, either due to previous immunisation or due to mycobacterial exposure or infection. This sensitisation leads to the production of TH-1 memory T cells which respond to the tuberculin antigen by secreting cytokines.These in turn attract macrophages and granulocytes as part of a cell mediated reaction. The delayed hypersensitivity reaction is cell mediated, not antibody mediated. A positive tuberculin skin test does not indicate that the B cell mediated components of the immune system are functional. It also does not indicate the presence of antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis."
pediatrics,498,A 2-year-old child is admitted with a two day history of diarrhoea. Which of the following statements correctly applies to his condition?,Adenovirus is the commonest pathogen isolated,Dehydration is best assessed clinically rather than biochemical,He should be treated with anti-diarrhoeal agents,He should be treated with boiled water alone for 24 hours,Hyponatraemia is expected,B,"Hypernatraemic and hyponatraemic dehydration are both infrequent complications of childhood gastroenteritis. Rotavirus is the commonest pathogen. Anti-diarrhoeal agents are not recommended in the treatment, as they may cause complications such as respiratory depression, bowel obstruction and bacterial overgrowth. Biochemical tests may not be abnormal till the dehydration is advanced. Clinical signs such as decreased urine output, dry mucous membranes and sunken fontanelle may appear when the child is more than 5% dehydrated. Oral rehydration with a glucose electrolyte solution (sodium, glucose, chloride, potassium) is recommended."
pediatrics,499,"A 1-month-old boy has been brought to the emergency department, conscious but with cool peripheries and has HR 222bpm. He has been irritable and feeding poorly for 24 hours. CXR borderline enlarged heart with clear lung fields. ECG regular narrow complex tachycardia, with difficulty identifying p wave. What is the single most appropriate immediate treatment?",Administer fluid bolus,Administer oxygen,Oral beta-blockers,Synchronized DC cardio-version,Unilateral carotid sinus massage,D,As the patient is in probable hemodynamic instability (suggested by cool peripheries due to low BP or inadequate CO) so we should go for DC cardioversion.

Which of the following disorders can be expected to develop over the next couple of years?,Diabetes mellitus,Hyponatraemia,Poor growth,Precocious puberty,Spastic diplegia,C,"Pan-hypopituitarism following surgical treatment would be expected, hence poor growth. Diabetes insipidus and hypernatraemia rather than hyponatraemia may be observed. Delayed puberty would be expected rather than precocious puberty. Spastic diplegia would suggest extensive lateral expansion, which would not be expected. Diabetes mellitus is not a usual consequence."
pediatrics,502,"Regarding childhood circumcision, which of the following is correct?",Balanitis xerotica obliterans is a relative contraindication,Balanitis xerotica obliterans may involve the urethral meatus,It is indicated when hypospadias is present,It is routinely performed for phimosis,Postoperative bleeding is rarely associated with the frenular vessels,B,"Circumcision is contraindicated in hypospadias, as the prepucial skin may be utilised in the repair. Phimosis may resolve with conservative management (1% topical hydrocortisone), but if balanitis xerotica obliterans (white scarring, which can also affect the urethral meatus) is present, circumcision is mandatory. Frenular vessels or the dorsal vein are frequent culprits in postoperative bleeding."
pediatrics,503,A 41+5/40 gestation infant is born by SVD weighing 2.31 kg with Apgars of 7 at 1 minute and 9 at five minutes. Pregnancy was complicated by maternal smoking and poor growth on antenatal ultrasound in the final trimester. There is no family history of note. On examination his weight is between the 0.4% and 3% and his OFC on the 25%. He has peeling skin. His temperature on arrival in the neonatal unit is 35.6°C and BM stix is 2.0 mmol/L. There are no specific abnormalities to find. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Asymptomatic hypoglycaemia,CMV infection,Edwards syndrome,Hypoparathyroidism,Sepsis,A,"This child is small for gestational age, with preservation of head size. This suggests late pregnancy malnutrition. As in this case, such children are at risk of hypoglycaemia and hypothermia, as they have limited glycogen and brown fat reserves. Hypothermia increases surfactant consumption, with a risk of developing surfactant-deficient lung disease. Peeling skin indicates post-maturity."
pediatrics,504,"A 14-year-old boy is admitted via the Emergency department following a car accident. He was a passenger in a joyriding incident, and the car had been crashed doing about 15 miles an hour whilst turning on an estate. There is no previous medical history of note. He is a poor school attender. On examination he answers questions vaguely and seems disoriented in time. There is no evidence of visible injury. He is unshaven and has a rash around his mouth and nose. BM stix is 4.7 mmol/L. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Diabetic ketoacidosis,Head trauma,Hepatic failure,Herpes encephalitis,Substance abuse,E,The history suggests a degree of disorientation out of keeping with the degree of trauma. The rash around the mouth raises the possibility of glue sniffing. He should also have urine sent for toxicology to exclude substance abuse. Social services should be involved.
pediatrics,505,"A 41/40 girl is born weighing 1.9 kg with Apgars of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 10 minutes. Pregnancy was complicated by maternal hypertension and proteinuria. Antenatal ultrasound showed absent end diastolic flow in the umbilical artery. The placenta was small and gritty, with a spindly umbilical cord. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.2°C, with no specific abnormalities to find. Birth weight is well below the 3% and OFC on the 10%. There are no dysmorphic features and she is self-ventilating in air. What complication is most likely to occur?",Hypocalcaemia,Hypoglycaemia,Necrotising enterocolitis,Sepsis,Surfactant-deficient lung disease,B,"The history is of late pregnancy placental insufficiency causing growth retardation of the infant, with relative head sparing. In this case maternal pregnancy induced hypertension is the root cause. Intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) infants are at increased risk of:  intrauterine death birth asphyxia hypoglycaemia necrotising enterocolitis polycythaemia, and dysmorphic syndromes."

Which one of the following findings would point to a diagnosis of Marfan's syndrome?,Echocardiogram shows ascending aortic aneurysm,History of peripheral arterial occlusion,Mental retardation,Osteoporosis,Short stature,A,"Marfan's syndrome is autosomal dominant and shares some features in common with homocystinuria (scoliosis, tall stature, lens subluxation), but mental retardation, osteoporosis and arterio/venous thrombosis are features of the latter condition."
pediatrics,507,An 18-year-old male presents with a six week history of a painful swollen right knee. He had been treated for a sexually transmitted disease three months ago. On examination there was a large effusion in the right knee. Synovial fluid analysis revealed a white cell count of 16 ×10^9/L (4-11) but culture was negative. Which one of the following organisms is the most likely cause?,Human papilloma virus,Herpes simplex,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Treponema pallidum,Trichomonas vaginalis,C,"Bacteria are the most common cause of monoarthritis. Staphylococcus aureus and gonococci are the most common causes of septic arthritis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae typically occurs in young adults. Presentation is either as a bacteraemic form (classic triad of migratory polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis) which is usually polyarticular or a septic arthritis, as in this case. The septic arthritis form presents with joint symptoms which begin within days to weeks of gonococcal infection. Gram stain is positive in 25% and culture positive in 50%. This patient has been treated previously for a sexually acquired infection and this may be why the culture is negative. Reactive arthritis can also result following a sexually acquired infection (usually Chlamydia trachomatis) and can result in mono or poly-arthritis"
pediatrics,508,"A 12-month-old boy presents with a history of developmental delay. He sat without support and rolled from front to back and vice versa at 8 months of age, but no significant progress was noticed since then. Clinical examination revealed a thin boy with proximal muscle weakness and absent deep tendon reflexes. Moreover, you note a fine tremor in his hands and feet. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Arthrogryposis multiplex,Myasthenia gravis,Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy,Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy,Type 3 spinal muscular atrophy,D,"Spinal muscular atrophy is characterised by degeneration of the anterior horn cells. It is an autosomal recessive disorder and has four subtypes, with type 1 being the most severe and type 4 the least severe. This patient has symptoms and signs suggesting spinal muscular atrophy. Type 2 is most likely because the presentation is after 6 months of age, whereas in type 1 the presentation is early in the neonatal period. Type 3 spinal muscular atrophy is a milder disorder presenting after 18 months of age. Arthrogryposis multiplex also presents in the early infantile period with prominent evidence of joint contractures and dimorphism. "
pediatrics,509,"A 7-year-old girl presents to the Emergency department with a history of seizure that has resolved with rectal diazepam administered by the mother 20 minutes ago. She is a known epileptic. On examination the patient is unconscious but has normal spontaneous breathing in room air. Blood pressure 100/70 mmHg, capillary refill time 1.5 seconds, and temperature 37.7°C. On further questioning you discover that the mother has given three times the recommended dose of buccal midazolam. What is the next step in the management plan?",Close observation,Elective ET intubation,IV Ceftriaxone,Place an NGT and give activated charcoal,Urgent flumazenil IV,A,"Benzodiazepine overdose is rarely seen in paediatric age group, but epileptic children are more prone to overdoses due to human error by parents. There is no need to treat benzodiazepine overdose unless it causes a severe respiratory depression. So, as this patient is breathing spontaneously with stable vital signs, close observation and supportive care are all that is needed. Elective intubation is not indicated at this stage and should not be considered. Most patients who present with seizures are expected to have a mild degree of fever. So, giving antibiotics at this stage is not recommended unless there are other signs of infection. Activated charcoal can be used in case of oral diazepam overdose which is not usually seen in young children. Flumazenil is not indicated as the patient is not having respiratory depression. Her comatose state is simply a postictal state, which is expected. In addition, if Flumazenil is given it may reverse the therapeutic action of diazepam and the child may then develop a seizure again. "
pediatrics,510,Which of the following phenotypes is responsible for the most severe form of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency?,piMM,piMS,piSS,piSZ,piZZ,E,Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency is caused by defective production of alpha 1 antitrypsin which leads to decreased activity in the blood and lungs and excessive abnormal protein in liver cells. Alpha 1 antitrypsin protects the body from the effects of neutrophil elastase. Sufferers therefore have early onset emphysema and liver disease. The most common allele M represents a normal gene encoding for alpha 1 protein. Between 70-90% of the population have this phenotype. S and Z represent mutations in the gene.    piMM produces normal levels   piMS produces 80% of the normal levels   piSS produces ~60% of the normal levels   piSZ produces ~40% of the normal level   piZZ produces 10-15% of the normal levels    People with the piZZ phenotype will develop emphysema at a young age and it can cause neonatal cholestasis.
pediatrics,511,"A 12-year-old boy is referred to the paediatric outpatient clinic by his primary care physician. He is concerned because he feels he is unsteady when he is walking and he finds it hard to keep up with the other children during his football practice. The other children have also been laughing at him as he keeps falling over his own feet. His mother states he has always been a clumsy child but she was not concerned before as his father was also very clumsy. His father unfortunately died in a car accident 11 years ago, the circumstances of the accident were unclear but it seems he failed to break and ended up accelerating into a wall. On examination you note there is wasting of the lower part of the leg, pes cavus and foot drop. Which of the following investigations in most likely to lead to a defintive diagnosis?",Electromyography,Gene testing for dystrophin gene,Muscle biopsy,Nerve biopsy,Serum creatine kinase,D,"This case describes a boy with peroneal muscular atrophy, otherwise known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease or hereditary motor-sensory neuropathy type 1. The condition is usually asymptomatic until late childhood/early adolescence, however there may be gait disturbance as young as 2 years of age or patients may remain asymptomatic up until the fifth decade. These children are often described as clumsy and may trip over frequently. In this condition the muscles in the anterior compartment of the leg gradually become wasted resulting in 'upside down champagne bottle' or 'stork-like' legs. This results in progressive weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and causes foot drop. There may also be atrophy of the muscles of the forearm and hand but this is not as severe as the atrophy of the leg muscles. The sensory elements affected are usually proprioception and vibration sense. The condition shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Diagnosis is based on nerve conduction studies, which show a greatly reduced velocity in both motor and sensory fibres and also molecular genetic diagnosis looking for the HSMN type 1 gene on chromosome 17. Definitive diagnosis however is based on sural nerve biopsy which shows characteristic 'onion bulb formations'. Creatine kinase levels are normal and electromyography and muscle biopsy are not required for diagnosis"
pediatrics,512,"A 13-year-old girl is rushed into hospital, having become rapidly drowsy after running the 1500 metres in the school athletics competition.

Her temperature is 36.5°C, Respiratory rate 12/min and heart rate 80/min. There are no focal neurological findings. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hypoglycaemia,Postural hypotension,Substance abuse,Vasovagal episode,Viral encephalitis,A,"The history suggests tight diabetic control, with neurological deterioration following exercise. Hypoglycaemic coma is most likely, and the sweatiness and pallor are suggestive. The BM stix in this case was 1.2 mmol/L and she recovered rapidly with a bolus of IV 10% dextrose."
pediatrics,513,Which one of the following statements is true regarding scabies?,Is best treated by salicylate emulsion,It can be spread by a droplet infection,It causes pruritus,It is caused by Staphlococcus aureus,Typically it affects the face,C,Scabies typically affects the interdigital webs and skin folds of the arms and legs. The itch may persist for two to three weeks after successful treatment. It is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Permethrin-containing lotions are the treatment. It is spread by skin contact and sharing clothes and bedding.
pediatrics,514,Which of the following conditions is most compatible with survival to term?,Monosomy 21,"Monosomy X (45,X Turner syndrome)",Trisomy 13,Trisomy 18,Trisomy 21,E,The most likely disorder from the above list that would survive to term is trisomy of C21 as monosomy of any chromosomes such as Turner's makes survival unlikely unless there is some mosaicism. The other trisomies also create a less stable fetal environement.
pediatrics,515,A 16-year-old Ashkenazi Jewish boy presents with bone pain and anaemia. An x ray of the femur demonstrates an Erlenmeyer flask deformity. Metabolic investigations show:    Bone marrow focal accumulations of ovoid histiocytes with abundant blue-grey cytoplasm   White cell enzymes glucocerebrosidase activity 1 nmol/hour/mg protein (normal greater than8.7 nmol/hour/mg)   Chitotriosidase activity 200 nmol/hour/mL (normal less than78.5 nmol/hour/mL)    What is the diagnosis?,Anderson-Fabry disease,CMV infection,Type 1 Gaucher's disease,Type 2 Gaucher's disease,Haematological malignancy,C,"Gaucher's disease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder (LSD) caused by loss of function mutations in the glucocerebrosidase (GBA) gene, which encodes the glucosylceramidase enzyme. It is most common among Ashkenazi Jews where the carrier rate is around 1/12. Clinical features of type 1 Gaucher's disease include:  bone disease - osteoporosis, bone pain, avascular necrosis (the Erlenmeyer flask deformity is classic) bone marrow infiltration with blood dyscrasia, and hepatosplenomegaly.  Gaucher's cells are found on biopsy; they are macrophages stuffed with undegraded substrate. Parkinson's disease and peripheral neuropathy are complications in later life. Diagnosis is based on deficient glucosylceramidase activity in white blood cells, confirmed by mutation testing. Chitotriosidase is released by Gaucher's cells and is a marker of disease activity. Treatment for Gaucher's disease is by enzyme replacement therapy. Anderson-Fabry disease is not correct; this is an x-linked LSD with vascular presentation (renovascular disease, stroke, neuropathy, angiokeratoma). CMV infection would not cause the bone disease. Type 2 Gaucher's disease is caused by the same genetic defect as type 1 but presents in early childhood with neurodegeneration; what causes the two subtypes to differ is unknown. The clinical picture here is not one of haematological cancer (e.g., leukaemia) as the Gaucher's cells on bone marrow biopsy are diagnostic of Gaucher's disease.

pediatrics,517,Which of the following is correct regarding intraosseous cannulation for the infusion of fluids and drugs?,Is a technique frequently performed on paediatric and adult patients,Is rarely indicated during a paediatric cardiac arrest,"In the presence of limb bone fractures, the intraosseous cannula should be inserted at the fracture site",In the tibia an intraosseous cannula should be inserted in the midline at the level of the tibial tuberosity,Should be considered when attempts at gaining peripheral venous access are prolonged,E,"First used in the 1930s as an alternative method of gaining vascular access, intraosseous cannulation is currently recommended during life threatening situations when vascular access is required quickly. Therefore, when attempts at gaining venous access fail or are delayed, intraosseous cannulation should be considered. In paediatric cardiac arrest it is the recommended technique for gaining circulatory access. Many potential anatomical sites for intraosseous cannulation have been described, including the lower and upper limbs and sternum. The correct site on the proximal tibia is 2 to 3 cm below the tibial tuberosity on the antero-medial surface. Fracture sites should be avoided, as should limbs with proximal fractures."
pediatrics,518,A parent comes to your GP surgery for advice. Her son has just started nursery and she is not sure for which skin infections she needs to keep him away. For which one of the following skin infections should you advise her to keep her son excluded from nursery until the lesions have healed?,"Hand, foot and mouth",Herpes simplex,Impetigo,Molluscum contagiosum,Roseola infantum,C,"The following skin infections do not need exclusion:  Athlete's foot Herpes simplex Hand, foot and mouth Molluscum contagiosum Roseola (infantum) Slapped cheek/fifth disease/parvovirus B19 Warts and verrucae.  The following do need exclusion:  Chickenpox - should be isolated for five days from onset of rash German measles (rubella) - should be isolated for six days from onset of rash Impetigo - should be isolated until lesions are crusted and healed or 48 hours after starting antibiotics Measles - should be isolated for four days from onset of rash Scabies - can return after first treatment Shingles - only exclude if rash is weeping and cannot be covered.

He has a metabolic acidosis as bicarbonate levels are low. Rehydration should be relatively quickly, however over-vigorous correction of the fluid deficit will precipitate cerebral oedema. The initial choice of fluid is 0.9% saline, 'normal saline'."
pediatrics,520,Which of the following is true of atopic eczema?,Does not have a genetic basis,Does not respond to dietary measures,Is a generalised rash over the whole body,Should be treated in its early stages with topical corticosteroids,Usually starts in the first year of life,E,"Atopic eczema is more common in those with a family history of asthma, hayfever and eczema. Cow's milk is a common cause and switching to a milk hydrolysate may assist. The typical distribution is face, ears, elbows and knees. Topical steroids should be applied sparingly only if symptoms cannot be controlled. Often it develops in the first year of life."
pediatrics,521,"A 2-year-old boy presents with neck glands and general unwellness for the past month. Mother has also noted that 'his eyes look funny'. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.7°C, with RR 25/min and HR 100/min. He looks unwell and has marked rubbery cervical lyphadenopathy. The right eye has a small pupil, which fails to dilate in the dark. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral abscess,Cerebral TB,Cerebral toxoplasmosis,Lymphoma,Neuroblastoma,E,The history of massive glandular enlargement plus Horner's syndrome suggest a neuroblastoma. About 30% of neuroblastomas arise in the thoracic or cervical ganglia. Other rare presentations include andquot;dancing eyes dancing feetandquot; (opsoclonus-myoclonus) and andquot;racoon eyesandquot; (proptosis and periorbital ecchymosis). 
pediatrics,522,Which one of the following is true regarding protein metabolism?,Essential amino acids can be synthesised in the liver and kidneys,Human milk as the only food provides an insufficient source of protein for a 1-year-old healthy infant,Protein constitutes about 30-45% of total daily calorie intake in infants and children,The absence of any of the essential amino acids results in a negative nitrogen balance,There are five essential amino acids,D,"There are nine essential amino acids; all are required to maintain nitrogen balance. Carbohydrates constitute 30-45% of total caloric intake in children. Essential amino acids cannot be synthesised and must be obtained from the diet. Human milk contains the proteins casein, lactoglobulin and lactalbumin, which provide a sufficient source of protein."
pediatrics,523,A baby is born with short limbs. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Alloimmune thrombocytopenia of the newborn,Bacterial sepsis,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Isoimmune thrombocytopenia of the newborn,TAR syndrome,E,TAR syndrome is thrombocytopenia with absent radius; an autosomal recessive condition. There is a risk of intracranial haemorrhage during the thrombocytopenic episodes. 
pediatrics,524,Which one of the following is a characteristic feature of hereditary spherocytosis?,In a 5-year-old child the spleen is likely to be enlarged,It does not present during the neonatal period,It is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait,The Coombs' test is usually positive,The majority of those affected will die before reaching adult life,A,The disease is usually transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. Some forms can present in the neonatal period but overall there is a large spectrum of clinical disease. Splenomegaly is common. Haemolysis occurs and the blood film can look similar to autoimmune haemolytic anaemia. The Coombs' test is negative in hereditary spherocytosis which helps distinguish it from autoimmune haemolytic anameia. Splenectomy stops further haemolysis and the patient can lead a normal life. The timing of splenectomy is very individual - ideally it will be done after 5 years old when the chances of life-threatening encapsulated bacterial infection reduce.
pediatrics,525,"An 18-month-old boy presents with fever for six days and large neck glands. He has begun to develop an erythematous rash. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 38.9°C and he is miserable. He has bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis, massive tender cervical lymphadenopathy, swollen hands and a strawberry tongue. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Measles,Parvovirus infection,Scarlet fever,B,"A diagnosis of Kawasaki disease is made likely by:  fever for more than than five days cervical nodes rash strawberry tongue, and conjunctivitis.  The criteria for diagnosis are clinical. Treatment with IVIG (2 g/kg) and high dose aspirin (50 mg/kg/d) within 10 days of disease onset reduces the risk of coronary artery aneurysm."
pediatrics,526,"A 2-month-old boy has had a mild coryza for two days. Mother hears him making odd noises on the baby monitor. When she investigates she finds him floppy, pale and not breathing. She stimulates him, attempts mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and calls an ambulance. They give bag ventilation and he starts breathing again. Oxygen is given on the way to hospital. Born at 32/40 gestation weighing 1.7 kg he required 3d ventilation for surfactant-deficient lung disease. Since discharge he has been thriving. On arrival at hospital he is self-ventilating in facemask oxygen, with saturations of 94%. Temperature is 37.8°C, with RR 35/min, mild recession, and HR of 140/min. Scattered coarse crepitations and wheeze are audible in both lung fields. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bronchiolitis,Cardiac dysrhythmia,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,Pertussis,Seizure,A,"This child has respiratory tract infection (RTI) followed by an acute life-threatening event (ALTE). There are a large number of potential causes. In this case bronchiolitis is most likely, given the examination findings. "
pediatrics,527,"A 6-year-old girl presents with neck swelling and breathlessness, worsening over six weeks. She has felt increasingly tired and unwell. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.7°C, respiratory rate 25/min and pulse 95/min. She looks unwell and has large rubbery enlargement of glands in the right lateral neck area. She is slightly breathless at rest, with stony dullness to percussion and decreased breath sounds in the right base. What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Lymphoma,Tuberculosis,D,"The history suggests pleural effusion and lymphatic infiltration. The most likely diagnosis is a lymphoblastic lymphoma. In TB a swinging fever and weight loss would be more common. A chest x ray often shows a round lesion arising from the mediastinum. Staging involves CT scans of the neck and thorax, and detailed histology. Dissemination to the bone, marrow, skin and central nervous system is not uncommon."

pediatrics,529,Which of the following immunisations are recommended in a child aged between 14-16 years?,BCG,Haemophilus influenzae B,MMR,Pertussis,Tetanus,E,A booster tetanus and diphtheria vaccination is required at aged 14-16 years. These boosters are recommended every 10 years. A second dose of MMR is given in some countries at age 12. BCG vaccination is offered to various groups according to risk and is not therefore routine. 
pediatrics,530,A 2-year-old male patient was brought by his mother with a swelling in the right side of his neck extending from the angle of the mouth to the middle 1/3 of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The swelling was on the anterolateral side of the sternocleidomastoid and was brilliantly transilluminant. What is the likely diagnosis?,Lymphangioma,Branchial cyst,Thyroglossal cyst,Ranula,Thyroid swelling,A,Both lymphangioma and brancheal cyst are lateral neck mass. 90% of lymphangioma occur in children less than 2 yrs. Brancheal cyst usually does not transilluminate whereas lymphangioma usually transilluminate brilliantly
pediatrics,531,"A 9-year-old girl presents with knee swelling. She had a diarrhoeal illness four weeks before, but has otherwise been healthy. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.9°C, respiratory rate is 15/min and pulse is 80/min. She has slight swelling of the right knee, which has 20 degrees loss of both flexion and extension. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Dermatomyositis,Oligoarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Polyarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Reactive arthritis,Systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,D,"The history of mild joint inflammation a few weeks after a diarrhoeal illness suggests a reactive arthritis. This usually settles within six weeks, which helps to distinguish it from juvenile chronic arthritis. Bacterial triggers include:  Campylobacter Shigella Salmonella, and Yersinia.  Viral triggers include:  Rubella Hepatitis B Parvovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).  Treatment is with anti-inflammatories and physiotherapy."
pediatrics,532,A 6-year-old boy presents with a four hour history of an extremely tender right testicle. The pain arose suddenly and there was no history of trauma or concurrent medical illness. On examination the right testicle was noted to be retracted and horizontal lying but was too tender to allow a complete palpation. The left hemiscrotum was normal. What is the likely diagnosis?,Epididymo-orchitis,Hydrocoele,Mumps orchitis,Testicular tumour,Torsion,E,"A short history of severe pain in the absence of other symptoms must be regarded as torsion. Even if other symptoms are present, care must be taken not to overlook the possibility of torsion as there is a limited window of opportunity for treatment. A horizontal-lying testis is a classical finding, though not always seen."
pediatrics,533,"A 3-month-old girl presents with liver enlargement of 4 cm. She is slightly breathless and not gaining weight well. She had a full term normal delivery and is noted to have Down's facies, confirmed as trisomy 21 on karyotype. Her immunisations are up to date and there is no family or social history of note. On examination:    Temperature 36.5°C   Respiratory rate 45/min (mild recession)   Pulse 140/min    She has cutaneous stigmata of Down's. Pulses are normal in all four limbs. She has an active praecordium with loud S2 and pansystolic murmur loudest at the lower left sternal border and apex. Liver is 4 cm and spleen 3 cm. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic coarctation,"Atrial septal defect, secundum",Atrioventricular septal defect,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Ventricular septal defect,C,"The key points are the Down's syndrome and heart failure with loud murmurs. Fifty percent of Down syndrome patients have structural congenial heart disease. The most common abnormalities are atrio-ventricular canal defect followed by VSD. ASD would give a pulmonary flow murmur and fixed splitting of S2. Coarctation gives weak or absent femorals and an interscapular murmur. Hypoplastic left heart presents much earlier. AVSD tends to present at this sort of age with heart failure, and is commoner than VSD in Downs. The AVSD (AV canal defects) form a spectrum from complete canal defect to ostium primum ASD. In primum ASD there is a defect in the lower part of the atrial septum. In the complete canal defect there is also involvement of the medial part of the tricuspid and mitral valves, and in the upper part of the ventricular septum. Hence there are overlapping murmurs of ASD, VSD, tricuspid and mitral regurgitation together with heart failure. After detailed evaluation by echocardiography, surgical repair is undertaken. "
pediatrics,534,A term male infant is delivered by caesarean section and develops tachypnoea and grunting. Chest x ray reveals well inflated lung fields but numerous linear shadows extending from the hilar regions. What is the likely diagnosis?,Aspiration pneumonia,Congenitally acquired pneumonia,Meconium aspiration,Pulmonary oedema,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,E,"The description is of transient tachypnoea of the newborn, a condition associated with the delayed clearance of amniotic fluid from the newborn. It is associated with:  prematurity caesarian section, and infants born to diabetic mothers.  The chest x ray features are characteristic and the condition usually resolves over 24-72 hours."
pediatrics,535,Which of the following is true concerning undescended testes?,Are less common in preterm babies,Are often associated with a direct inguinal hernia,Commonly cause pain,Predispose to malignancy,Which are retractile provide an indication for orchidopexy,D,"True undescended testes are always associated with indirect inguinal hernias. They are more common in preterm babies (incidence of 17% in low birth weight babies as compared to 4% in term infants). Undescended testes are not painful. Retractile testes retract into the inguinal canal in response to an exaggerated cremasteric reflex. Consequently, when testes that were palpable become impalpable, retractile testes are suspected. Often more than one examination is required to confirm the diagnosis. If retractile, the testis adopts a permanent position in the scrotum by puberty, and does not have any of the associated complications of undescended testes, such as infertility and malignancy."
pediatrics,536,Which of the following is characteristic of Bartter's Syndrome?,Diarrhoea,Hyperkalaemia,Metabolic acidosis,Reduced renal concentrating ability,Secondary hyperaldosteronism,E,"Bartter syndrome is a rare form of renal potassium wasting characterised by hypokalaemia, normotension, and elevated renin and aldosterone levels. It is occasionally autosomal recessive. There is hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in most cases. It is postulated that the primary defect is in chloride reabsorption in the ascending limb, resulting in sodium chloride excessively presented to the distal tubule, with sodium reabsorption in exchange for potassium, resulting in urinary potassium wasting. There is secondary stimulation of prostaglandin synthesis, which activates the renin angiotensin aldosterone system which exacerbates the renal potassium wasting. The following are typical in younger children:  Growth failure Muscle weakness Constipation Polyuria  Dehydration  The following are present in older children:  Muscle weakness Cramps or Carpopedal spasms  The potassium is less than 2.5 mmol/L, there is metabolic alkalosis, and hyperammonaemia with hyperaldosteronism. There are high levels of urinary potassium and chloride. The high urinary chloride level is helpful in distinguishing it from similar presentations which have low urinary chloride levels, such as:  Liquorice Laxative, or diuretic use Persistent vomiting or diarrhoea Pyelonephritis, or Diabetes insipidus.  Oral potassium and indomethacin may be used. "
pediatrics,537,Which one of the following statements correctly applies to a child being treated for leukaemia?,Male sex carries a favourable prognosis,Meningeal leukaemia is completely preventable,Passive protection with hyperimmune gammaglobulin should be given for measles,Treatment will usually result in infertility,Uric acid nephropathy occurs in remission,C,"Males have a worse prognosis and receive a longer duration of treatment. Prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy and cranial radiation does not prevent meningeal leukaemia in all cases. Passive protection against measles should be given, as the immune response to the vaccine will be inadequate. Infertility is not common, however in males testicular relapse may occur. Uric acid nephropathy occurs when there are high levels of circulating blasts and cell breakdown is occurring, for example, during chemotherapy."
pediatrics,538,"A 5-year-old boy presents with a three week history of polydipsia, polyuria and weight loss. He now has breathing difficulty. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he is apyrexial and unwell. Respiratory rate is 15/min with deep sighing pattern. Heart rate is 150/min. He is cold to the elbows with a capillary refill time of 4 seconds. Abdomen is soft. Urinalysis shows 4+ glucose and 3+ ketones. BM stix is 45 mmol/L. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Diabetes insipidus, central","Diabetes insipidus, renal",Diabetic ketoacidosis,Hyperosmolar coma,Hypoglycaemic coma,C,"The history of polydipsia, polyuria and weight loss suggests diabetes, however, remember also that the absence of these symptoms in a child does not preclude diabetic ketoacidosis. The respiratory pattern, BM stix and urinary results confirm ketoacidosis. The treatment is fluid replacement to relieve shock, followed by insulin infusion and replacement of fluid deficit over 36-48 hours. Careful neurological observation and fluid and electrolyte monitoring is required to avoid cerebral oedema, the commonest cause of death in such patients."
pediatrics,539,Which of the following is true of a 6-year-old child with Down syndrome and treated congenital heart disease?,Coeliac disease is a usual by the second decade of life,Congenital aganglionic megacolon may be an associated condition,He most probably had tetralogy of Fallot repaired,He will inevitably develop premature senility by the age of 50,It is most likely that his mother was over 36 when he was born,B,"Although the risk increases with advancing maternal age, the incidence is greater in younger mothers as there are more children born to women in this age group. The most common cardiac defect is an AV canal defect. Hirschsprung's disease is associated. Alzheimer's disease was once considered to be inevitable, but it occurs in roughly 25% of patients. Coeliac disease is found in about 5-15% of Down children. Duodenal atresia is also found."
pediatrics,540,"A 9-year-old girl is running down the stairs when she lands heavily on the outside of the right foot. She cries out in pain and seeks help. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. She hobbles in supported by her teacher. She can weight bear. On examination her right ankle is swollen, warm and appears bruised. There is limitation of movement, particularly internal rotation, and she is tender along the lateral aspect of the ankle joint. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ankle dislocation,Ankle fracture,Ankle sprain,Fibular fracture,Tibial fracture,C,"The history suggests a forced internal rotation at the ankle joint, causing a sprain of the lateral ligaments of the ankle. This requires supportive strapping, analgesia and graduated mobilisation. If there is doubt about a fracture, imaging can be used to confirm the diagnosis. "
pediatrics,541,"A preschool boy presented to the respiratory clinic with recurrent sinusitis and pneumonias. His nursery teachers noted he had difficulty hearing. A CT scan was performed which showed chronic sinusitis and thickened medium sized airways, consistent with bronchiectasis and normal cardiac outline and ventricular structure. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Kartagener syndrome,Primary ciliary dyskinesia,Recurrent aspiration,Sjögren's syndrome,C,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity reaction to fungus. It does cause bronchiectasis but would not give the other symptoms which are caused by ciliary dysmotility and are often associated with asthma. Kartagener syndrome is an autosomal recessive condition, consisting of situs inversus, chronic sinusitis and bronchiectasis. While it would cause the CT scan findings and difficulty hearing, with recurrent chest infections, the boy would not have a normal cardiac outline and ventricular structure. Primary ciliary dyskinesia is an autosomal recessive disorder that causes ciliary dysmotility in the respiratory and fallopian tracts and the flagellae of sperm in males. It causes reduced or absent mucus clearance from the lungs, and susceptibility to chronic recurrent respiratory infections, including sinusitis, pneumonia, and otitis media. Progressive bronchiectasis usually begins in early childhood. Although it can lead to bronchiectasis recurrent aspiration is not associated with ciliopathy. Sjögren's is an autoimmune disease, causing reduced secretions such as tears and saliva. It is not associated with bronchiectasis."
pediatrics,542,A 2-year-old child develops a scaly macular diffuse rash and is diagnosed with psoriasis. Which of the following is true of this diagnosis?,A common cause of alopecia totalis,Associated with cow's milk protein intolerance,Best treated initially with steroid creams,Sometimes a sequel to Streptococcal infection,Is associated with raised serum IgE,D,"Eczema is associated with cow's milk intolerance and itchiness, rather than psoriasis (though itch may still be a symptom). Eczema is an atopic condition and may be associated with raised IgE, but not psoriasis. Coal tar is commonly used initially. Small patches of alopecia are associated with psoriasis, rather than complete alopecia. Telogen effluvium is the typical form of hair loss that psoriasis induces, but sometimes psoriasis can cause a scarring alopecia. There is a rather loose association between streptococcal throat infections and psoriasis, resulting in guttate psoriasis. "
pediatrics,543,Which of the following are features of neurofibromatosis type 2?,Cushing's syndrome,Haemangiomas of the retina,Nephroblastoma,Osteosarcoma,Scoliosis,E,"Features of neurofibromatosis/von Recklinghausen's disease include:  neurofibrosarcomas phaeochromocytoma optic nerve tumours scoliosis, and acoustic neuromas.  "
pediatrics,544,"In a neonate, the spinal cord terminates at the lower border of:",L1,L2,L3,L4,T12,C,"In early fetal life, the spinal cord is as long as the vertebral canal. During development, however, increase in the length of the cord does not keep pace with the growth of the vertebrae. At birth the tip of the spinal cord has risen from the level of the second coccygeal vertebra to the lower border of the third lumbar vertebra."
pediatrics,545,"A 9-month-old boy presents with painful ankle swelling. He was born at 38+5/40 to healthy Caucasian parents, and there were no neonatal problems. He began to pull himself to stand 4 days earlier. There are no social concerns. On examination he looks well and is on the 75% for height and weight. Systemic examination is normal. His right ankle is swollen, warm, tender and has a purplish discolouration. An X ray shows soft tissue swelling around the right ankle, but no bony injury. FBC shows Hb 124 g/l, WC 7.3 x10^9/l, platelets 295x10^12/l. INR 1.1. APTT 1.4. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Child physical abuse,Haemophilia A,Haemophilia B,Idiopathic thrombocytopaenic purpura,von Willebrand's disease,B,"This child has developed ankle swelling soon after starting to stand. This is often a time of minor trauma, but this is not usually sufficient to cause problems. There are no other visible bruises or injuries, and nothing positive in the social history to suggest abuse. The INR, which is a measure of factors 1,2,5,7,and 10, is normal. The APTT, which is a measure of factors 8,9,11, and 12, is abnormal. The likely diagnosis is therefore a haemarthrosis due to a coagulopathy. The most likely abnormality in a boy is haemophilia A (20:100,000) rather than Haemophilia B (prevalence 5:100,000). This can be confirmed by specific factor VIII and IX assays. "
pediatrics,546,"A 12-day-old girl presents with poor feeding, vomiting and lethargy. She was born at 37+6/40, 2.98 kg and there were no neonatal problems. It was an uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery. No drugs or medications. No immunisations. No family or social history of note. On examination she is thin and wasted.

Examination suggests possible subtle fits. Although infection and a cardiac abnormality are possible, a metabolic condition should be strongly suspected. Evaluation should include:  blood sugar electrolytes NH4 blood gases serum and urine aminoacids, and urine organic acids.  In this case the clinical picture plus acidosis and elevated ammonia suggests an organic acidaemia, such as methylmalonic acidaemia or proprionic. A urea cycle defect would have an ammonia level in the 1000s."

Sepsis and congenital heart disease are possible, but there is no infection-related symptoms nor fever to suggest the former, and no murmur, liver enlargement or absent femorals to suggest the latter. Galactosaemia can present at this age with jaundice, hepatomegaly, vomiting, hypoglycaemia, fits, irritability or poor weight gain. There may be cataracts, liver or spleen enlargement. There is an increased risk of E. coli neonatal sepsis. Undiagnosed, cirrhosis and progressive mental retardation can result. The electrolytes make the likely diagnosis salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In salt-losing CAH female patients are usually highly virilised, but this may not be seen . in male children. In 21-OH deficiency low aldosterone levels can cause salt wasting, dehydration, low BP and shock. Non-salt losers may present with fast growth and early virilisation. "

He has a florid rash of vesicles and bullae over the face and trunk. The central areas of these appear necrotic. His mouth is ulcerated and his lips swollen. He has a RR of 25/min, with hacking cough and bilateral rhonchi. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Erythema multiforme,Impetigo,Kawasaki disease,Primary herpes simplex,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,E,"The history is of several days of fever and myalgia with cough and wheeze, followed by a severe rash involving the skin and two mucosal surfaces. This suggests a Mycoplasma chest infection complicated by Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Treatment is symptomatic, though ophthalmologists should be involved to prevent corneal scarring."
pediatrics,552,"A 14-year-old boy falls awkwardly while swinging from a rope in an adventure playground. He lands head first, causing violent flexion of his neck. An ambulance is called. He has previously been fit and well. He had a full term normal delivery and no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.5°C. He has been intubated and is being bag ventilated in 100% oxygen. Heart rate is 60/min and pulse is thready, though the peripheries are warm and pink. Blood pressure is 75 mmHg systolic by dynamap. He is paralysed from the neck down, and has a GCS of 8. What is the most mechanism of shock?",Anaemic,Cardiogenic,Distributive,Hypovolaemic,Septic,C,"The history suggests spinal cord transection causing neurogenic shock. Severe head injury or cord transection can prevent autonomic control of blood vessels, leading to fluid loss into the tissues (distributive shock). Unusually for shock the pulse is slow and the peripheries warm. Fluid replacement and treatment of the underlying cause (if possible) is indicated."
pediatrics,553,"41/40 girl is born weighing 1.9 kg with Apgars of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 10 minutes. Pregnancy was complicated by maternal hypertension and proteinuria.

pediatrics,554,A 5-year-old boy has just started school and is finding it difficult to colour in. The teachers think he may be colourblind. Who in his family must also have mutation for the development of their retinal cones?,Father,Mother,Mother and father,"No-one, colour blindness is not inherited",Sister,B,"The mutation for the development of retinal cones is on the X chromosome and causes the phenotype to be expressed in males who are hemizygous for the gene mutation (that is, they have only one X chromosome) and in females who are homozygous for the gene mutation (that is, they have a copy of the gene mutation on each of their two X chromosomes). Carrier females who have only one copy of the mutation do not usually express the phenotype, although differences in X chromosome inactivation can lead to varying degrees of clinical expression in carrier females. The chance that a child will inherit an X linked recessive condition in every pregnancy is different for sons and daughters and depends on whether the mother or father has the faulty gene. Examples of X linked recessive conditions are:  Duchenne muscular dystrophy Haemophilia A and B Red-green colour blindness Glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Fragile X (x-linked dominant but with reduced penetrance).  When the mother is a carrier of an X linked recessive faulty gene there is 1 chance in 2 (50%) that a son will be affected by the condition and a 1 chance in 2 that a daughter will be a carrier like the mother. When the father is affected by a condition due to an X linked recessive faulty gene, none of his sons will be affected but all of his daughters will be carriers of the X linked recessive faulty gene, although they will generally be unaffected by the condition. Since all males are affected through the maternal line, the correct option is mother. If the father was affected and the mother was not, his son would not be affected. If on the rare occasion that mother and father were both colour blind, then son would also be colour blind, but it is not necessary for the both to be colour blind to pass condition to son."
pediatrics,555,"A 2-month-old girl presents with a nappy rash. This has gradually worsened over the past one to two weeks. She has been otherwise well.

On examination her temperature is 36.8°C, respiratory rate 35/min and heart rate 110/min. She is completely well apart from a symmetrical confluent red rash in the napkin area. This has a peeling border, with 2-3 mm circular red spots with peeling borders lateral to it. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ammoniacal dermatitis,Histiocytosis,Napkin candidiasis,Scabies,Seborrhoeic dermatitis,C,"The rash suggests candida infection in the nappy area. This may be isolated or complicate an ammoniacal nappy rash. The latter is rarely seen in these days of disposable nappies, but spares the flexures. The satellite lesions and peeling edge are very characteristic of candida. The rash responds to topical anti-candidals."
pediatrics,556,"An 11-year-old girl presented to the Emergency department with sudden onset shortness of breath. She had used her usual salbutamol inhaler but found that it was not helping. She had a respiratory rate of 30 breaths per minute, heart rate of 120/minute, wheeze throughout her chest and a peak expiratory flow of 40% of best. According to BTS guidelines, which classification would best describe her condition?",Acute severe asthma,Brittle asthma,Life threatening asthma,Moderate asthma exacerbation,Near-fatal asthma,A,"According to BTS Asthma Guidelines any patients with features of acute severe or life threatening asthma should be referred to hospital. Other factors, such as failure to respond to treatment, social circumstances or concomitant disease, may warrant hospital referral. Acute severe asthma is any one of:  PEF 33-50% best or predicted Respiratory rate ≥25/min Heart rate ≥110/min Inability to complete sentences in one breath.  Brittle asthma is defined as:  Type 1: wide PEF variability (greater than40% diurnal variation for greater than50% of the time over a period greater than150 days) despite intense therapy Type 2: sudden severe attacks on a background of apparently well controlled asthma.  Life threatening asthma is any one of the following in a patient with severe asthma: Measurements:    PEF less than33% best or predicted   SpO2 less than92%   PaO2 less than8 kPa   PaCO2 normal 4.6-6.0 kPa    Clinical signs:  Altered conscious level Exhaustion Arrhythmia Hypotension Cyanosis Silent chest Poor respiratory effort.  A moderate asthma exacerbation is:  Increasing symptoms - PEF greater than50-75% best or predicted - no features of acute severe asthma.  Near-fatal asthma is defined as:  Raised PaCO2 and/or requiring mechanical ventilation with raised inflation pressures."
pediatrics,557,A young boy presented with peri-oral blisters. Some of which are weeping and others are crusted. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?,Impetigo,Varicella zoster,Shingles,Scabies,Herpes simplex,A,"Distribution of varicella zoster is centripetal (more in central area (trunk)) and less in limbs and face. On the other hand if blisters are present mainly on face or limbs and/or described as golden, yellow or honey coloured crusts, are impetigo"
pediatrics,558,Which of the following haematological disorders is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition?,Acute intermittent porphyria,Antithrombin III deficiency,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency,Protein C deficiency,Pyruvate kinase deficiency,E,"Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal dominant disorder resulting from partial porphobilinogen deaminase deficiency in the cytosol of all tissues including erythrocytes. Clinical expression of the disease is linked to environmental or acquired factors such as:  Nutritional status Drugs Steroids, and Chemicals.  The major abnormality is of the peripheral, autonomic or central nervous system (CNS). Major symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhoea. In severe cases the urine develops a port wine colour due to the high content of porphobilin, an auto-oxidation product of PBG. Hypertension and neuropathy are common, with muscle weakness, cranial nerve abnormality and seizures. Antithrombin III (AT3) is a plasma inhibitor protein that blocks the enzymatic activity of some serine proteases coagulation factors. The activity of this inhibitor is increased by heparin. AT3 is synthesised by the liver, is not vitamin K dependent, and can be consumed during disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Normal newborns have a reduced activity. Congenital AT3 deficiency is an autosomal dominant. Treatment of thrombotic events in these patients may be difficult. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is the most important disease of the pentose phosphate pathway, and is responsible for two clinical syndromes:  An episodic haemolytic anaemia induced by infections or certain drugs A spontaneous chronic non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia  The deficiency is X linked, and heterozygous females are resistant to falciparum infections. There are a large number of abnormal alleles causing disease of vastly different severity. Protein C is an inhibitor that, once activated, inhibits clot formation and enhances fibrinolysis. It is liver synthesised and vitamin K dependent. Protein C is converted to an active enzyme by a thrombin-thrombomodulin complex on the endothelial cell surface. Activated protein C inhibits a plasminogen activator inhibitor, which results in enhanced fibrinolysis, and, with protein S as a co-factor, inhibits the clotting of the activated factors 5 and 8 by limited proteolysis. Activated protein C thus controls the conversion of factor 10 to 10a and prothrombin to thrombin. Congenital deficiency is an autosomal dominant trait. Acquired deficiency may occur in association with infection. Pyruvate kinase deficiency is a rare congenital haemolytic anaemia inherited as an autosomal recessive. Generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) within the red cell is impaired, resulting in an abnormally high concentration of 2,3,DPG in the red cell, which inhibits the enzymes of the pentose phosphate pathway. Clinical manifestations vary from severe neonatal haemolysis, to a mild, well compensated haemolysis first noted in adulthood."
pediatrics,559,At routine 6 week check a mother expresses concern about her son's vision. Other than this he is well and thriving. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications.

Respiratory rate 30/min   Pulse 110/min    There are no other dysmorphic features. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Absent tear duct,Congenital cataract,Glaucoma,Hypermetropia,Myopia,C,"The findings of impaired vision, buphthalmos ('ox eye'), epiphora and conjunctival injection all suggest congenital glaucoma. The increase in intraocular pressure causes cupping of the optic disc. If Descemet's membrane is torn the cornea can become cloudy. Bilateral disease may present late (large eyes are considered attractive). Underlying disease may be present (e.g. Sturge-Weber, Lowe's)."
pediatrics,560,Which one of the following is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion?,Beta thalassaemia,Cystic fibrosis,Down’s syndrome,Neurofibromatosis,Prader-Willi syndrome,D,"Neurofibromatosis is a single gene autosomal dominant disorder. Beta thalassaemia is recessively inherited. One copy of the abnormal gene is termed 'thalassaemia minor' and if there are two copies of the abnormal gene the condition which develops is 'thalassaemia major'. Prader-Willi syndrome is a chromosomal disorder characterised by insatiable appetite, hyperglycaemia and short stature. Down's syndrome is a chromosomal disorder."
pediatrics,561,"A 12-year-old girl presents with a 12 month history of throbbing frontal headache. This is intermittent, but tends to occur more frequently around exam time at school. She is able to continue with normal activities. Mother describes her as a perfectionist. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. Mother and grandmother both have migraines. On examination she looks well and apyrexial. She is on the 25% for height and weight. Respiratory rate is 12/min, pulse 80/min and blood pressure is 80/55 mmHg. Fundoscopy is unremarkable. There are no neurological abnormalities. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cluster headache,Ependymoma,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Sinusitis,Tension headache,E,"The history is of isolated mild frontal headache, exacerbated by stress with a family history of migraine, in a neurologically normal child. The likely diagnosis is tension headaches. These form the mild end of a continuum with migraine. Most respond to simple analgesia, such as paracetamol. A pain diary may identify avoidable precipitants. Prophylaxis with pizotifen or psychology referral is occasionally required."
pediatrics,562,Which of the following is correct of sickle cell disease?,Exchange transfusions prior to major surgery on HbSS patients aims to lower the HbS concentration to 60%,It is caused by the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 4 on the beta chain of haemoglobin,The erythrocytes of Haemoglobin AS patients can sickle at a PO2 of 5 to 6 kPa (40-50 mmHg),The erythrocytes of Haemoglobin SC patients may sickle at a PO2 of 4 kPa (30 mmHg),"The Sickledex test involves adding a reagent to blood, which allows the nature of the haemoglobinopathy to be determined",D,"Sickle cell disease is a haemoglobinopathy caused by the substitution of glutamic acid by valine at position 6 (from the N-terminal) of the beta chain. Inherited as an autosomal gene, heterozygous (HbAS) and homozygous (HbSS) forms exist. A low partial pressure of oxygen (PO2) causes HbS to polymerise and precipitate, resulting in sickling of the erythrocyte. HbSS patients sickle at PO2 of 5-6 kPa and HbAS patients sickle at PO2 of 2.5-4 kPa. A mild disease is produced when heterozygotes for HbS combine with other haemoglobins, for example, haemoglobin C, thus creating HbSC. Sickling occurs at around 4 kPa. Diagnosis of sickle cell disease requires the detection of HbS. The Sickledex test involves the addition of reagent to blood; turbidity confirms the presence of HbS, but it gives no information on other haemoglobins. Haemoglobin electrophoresis is the only investigation that determines the nature of the haemoglobinopathy. Before surgery the aim is to reduce HbS concentration to less than 20% not 60%."
pediatrics,563,You want to prescribe a stimulant laxative for a teenage patient who is on opiates for pain from a bone malignancy. Which of the following laxatives is a stimulant laxative?,Bisacodyl,Ispaghula husk,Lactulose,Liquid paraffin,Magnesium salts,A,Bisacodyl is a stimulant laxative. Ispaghula is a bulk forming agent. Lactulose and magnesium salts are osmotic laxatives. Liquid paraffin is a faecal softener. 
pediatrics,564,You see a 6-year-old child who has well defined localised pigmented patches of the skin. A dermatologist has diagnosed café au lait spots and referred back to you for further management. Which of the following conditions is associated with café au lait spots?,Crohn's disease,Intestinal polyposis,Lymphoma,Neurofibromatosis,Pellagra,D,Neurofibromatosis occurs in two forms types 1 and 2. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is particularly associated with flat brown skin patches called café au lait spots. The condition can be hereditary with autosomal transmission but 30-60% of cases may occur as new spontaneous genetic mutations. Other features of the condition are benign tumours in the nervous system.
pediatrics,565,Which of the following is correct concerning type 1 diabetes in children?,Insulin therapy should be given only when oral hypoglycaemic agents fail,Retinopathy is commonly seen upon diagnosis,The adequacy of glycaemic control is most reliably assessed by twice daily urinalysis,The initial symptoms are usually polyuria and polydipsia,There is a strong hereditary component,D,"The disease often presents with ketoacidosis. The classic symptoms at presentation are polyuria, polydipsia, and weight loss. The genetic associations in type 1 diabetes are less strong. For example, the risk of type 1 diabetes developing in the child is 6.3% if the father is affected and 1.3% if the mother is affected. Insulin therapy is given initially. Microvascular complications do not usually appear till 5-10 years after the diagnosis. Glycaemic control can be assessed by capillary glucose testing and measurement of HbA1c."
pediatrics,566,"A new macrolide antibiotic is launched for the treatment of lower respiratory tract infection, and you trial it in an 8-year-old patient who is admitted with a left lower lobe pneumonia. He develops griping abdominal pains and diarrhoea, but this is recognised as a class effect. What is the most appropriate course of action?",Complete an adverse event form to send to the medicines regulator,Discontinue treatment,Prescribe an appropriate antidiarrhoeal,Recommend that the antibiotic is removed from the formulary,Tell your colleagues that the product is no different from others in the class,A,"The answer is, complete an adverse event form to send to the medicines regulator. Most countries operate a yellow card reporting system similar to that used in the United Kingdom for reporting adverse events. In this case, even though diarrhoea is reported as a class related adverse event, it is important to monitor the rate of occurrence, as it may occur more commonly with this agent versus others. There is no reason to discontinue treatment, and antidiarrhoeals are not recommended in this situation. Removing the antibiotic from the formulary or just discussing with colleagues is also not appropriate as this may lead to under reporting of product related adverse events."
pediatrics,567,A 4-year-old boy presents with hearing impairment and submucosal cleft palate. He has also had cardiac surgery for tetralogy of Fallot and has had 6 chest infections in the past year. What is the most likely diagnosis?,CHARGE syndrome,DiGeorge syndrome,Noonan syndrome,Sporadic cardiac defect,Williams syndrome,B,"DiGeorge syndrome is caused by a microdeletion on chromosome 22q11. The microdeletion is caused by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between low copy number repeats at the chromosome locus. The deletion can be inherited or de novo. Clinical features of DiGeorge syndrome include:  Cardiac defects, e.g. tetralogy of Fallot, ventricular septal defect, interrupted aortic arch Palate, e.g. cleft, submucous cleft, bifid uvula Facial dysmorphism Learning difficulties, and Immune deficiency.  Other features include hypocalcaemia, seizures, and skeletal malformations. The diagnosis of 22q11 deletion should be made by requesting an array comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH). This can detect deletions or duplications smaller than 5 Mb in size. 5 Mb is the smallest chromosomal abnormality detectable by conventional cytogenetics (looking at chromosomes under the microscope). CHARGE syndrome is autosomal dominant due to CHD7 mutations. It would be recognisable by a distinct appearance to the external ear. CHARGE is an acronym for:    C Iris coloboma   H Heart defect   A Atresia choanae   R Restriction of growth   G Genital anomalies   E Ear anomalies/deafness    In Noonan syndrome pulmonary stenosis is the classic cardiac lesion; it is autosomal dominant due to PTPN11 mutation. A sporadic cardiac defect is unlikely to be associated with other malformations. Williams syndrome is not the best answer here as the cardiac lesions are classically of the aortic valve. It is due to a microdeletion of chromosome 7 involving the elastin gene. "
pediatrics,568,Which one of the following statements is correct concerning errors of morphogenesis (congenital abnormalities):,30% of babies born to mothers with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus present at birth with multiple congenital abnormalities,In the newborn with multiple congenital abnormalities chromosomal aberrations are always found,Malformations and deformations are synonymous,Single gene defects account for the majority of congenital heart defects,Teratogens can cause abnormalities by interfering with organogenesis.,E,"Malformations include any structural, functional or biochemical abnormality determined genetically or induced during gestation and not due to birthing events. Deformation is a specific developmental anomaly of one organ or tissue. The incidence of birth defects is approximately 1%. Teratogens, maternal infections such as rubella may be the cause of multiple congenital abnormalities without any chromosomal abnormalities."
pediatrics,569,"A 3-year-old boy is referred because of an abdominal mass. He otherwise is well apart from sluggish bowel movements and sleep disturbance, which is causing stress in the family. He was a full term normal delivery weighing 3.4 kg. He had gastroenteritis at 13 months of age. On examination he is on the 75% for height and the 90th for weight. He has tympanic abdominal distension with no enlarged liver, spleen or kidneys. He has large non-tender irregular indentable masses in the left iliac fossa and suprapubic region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Duplex ureter,Dysplastic kidney,Idiopathic constipation,Neuroblastoma,D,"The history suggests chronic idiopathic (functional) constipation. Often this begins following gastroenteritis, when poor fluid intake results in hard stools. When these are passed they can tear the delicate anal mucosa, causing a fissure. There is then voluntary stool retention, completing the vicious circle. As in this case, psychological stresses are common."
pediatrics,570,"A 6-year-old girl presents with a 9 day history of abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and vomiting. She has no history of constipation and no relevant past medical history. On examination she has a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa and a temperature of 38.3°C. What is the best step for treatment?",Conservative treatment with analgesia and antibiotics,CT scan,Resuscitation followed by laparoscopic appendectomy,Resuscitation followed by laparotomy,Ultrasound scan and conservative treatment with antibiotics,E,"The child has a case of appendicitis, and has presented late, which can be because of the age of the child. An ultrasound scan would allow a diagnosis to be made, and look at whether the appendix is filled with pus. This can then help to direct the treatment. If the child improves after a two-week course of antibiotics, showing resolution of fever, return of bowel function, and general well-being, then an elective appendectomy can be considered for the future. A child who fails to improve within 24-72 hours needs an urgent appendectomy. Conservative management would be considered; however, before doing so it is important to confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis using ultrasound. If the appendix is filled with pus and at risk of perforation then resuscitation followed by laparotomy would be immediately required to prevent rupture (which could lead to peritonitis). CT scan provides too much radiation and is not necessary when ultrasound is available to make a diagnosis. CT alone is solely an investigation and not a treatment. "

She started dieting three months ago with a very strict diet plan. She has been drinking a lot of tea since then. She started feeling increasingly fatigued for the past two months associated with anorexia, abdominal discomfort and dysphagia. This is associated with irritability, sleep disturbance and poor memory. On examination, there is a decrease in vibratory position sensation, absent knee and ankle jerk reflexes. Heart rate: 130 beats/minutes. Blood pressure: 135/70. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?",Folate deficiency,Vitamin E deficiency,Vitamin B-1 deficiency,Vitamin B-6 deficiency,Vitamin B-12 deficiency,C,"Nutritional deficiencies are very rare in the developed world. Nevertheless, it can be seen in certain situations where there are other factors, such as malabsorption or strict dieting. Vitamin B-1 (Thiamine) is a coenzyme in carbohydrate metabolism, and its deficiency will lead to a decreased glucose availability. This has several consequences including fatigability and neurological and cardiac symptoms. This patient has two risk factors for developing vitamin B-1 deficiency: poor dietary intake and excessive tea drinking. In addition, the timing of symptoms (after one month of poor diet) is consistent with vitamin B-1 deficiency. "

In a child aged 6 months to 3 years with an atypical UTI (non-E. coli), as in this case, they should have a US during the acute infection and DMSA 4-6 months following the infection to look for renal scarring and a differentiation in function between the left and right side. MCUG should be considered in those with: dilatation on US, poor urine flow (suggestive of some obstruction), non-E. coli UTI, or family history of VUR. Atypical UTI includes: seriously ill/septicaemia/failure to respond to treatment within 48 hours, poor urine flow, abdominal or bladder mass, raised creatinine or non-E. coli UTI. Recurrent UTI is defined as:  Two or more episodes of UTI with a fever (suggesting upper tract infection/pyelonephritis) One UTI with a fever and one or more lower tract infection (no fever), or Three or more episodes of lower tract infection.

pediatrics,586,You are called to see a 3-hour-old female newborn who was noted by the midwife to be struggling to feed. On examination the patient had mild subcostal and intercostal recessions and was tachypnoeic. Oxygen in room air was 91% which increased to 99% with 2 L oxygen via nasal prongs. What is the next step in the management plan?,Feed via nasogastric tube and observe,Keep the patient on oxygen and try to feed after 3 hours if her condition improves,Order an urgent Echocardiography,"Take blood culture, FBC, CRP and try to wean off oxygen",Take a blood culture and start Benzylpenicillin and Gentamicin immediately,E,"This patient should be given broad spectrum antibiotics as the patient has more than one clinical indicator of sepsis (poor feeding, floppiness, respiratory distress, etc.). Neonatal sepsis is a common and a very risky condition that should be treated immediately to minimise morbidity and mortality. The NHS have developed guidelines to ensure that the patient receives the proper treatment, while minimising the risk of developing antibiotic resistance. The guidance uses clinical indicators and risk factors to determine the need for antibiotics rather than waiting for culture results which take at least 36 hours. The mode of supporting nutrition can be via nasogastric feeding or IV fluid support, but observation is not acceptable in such situation. Trial to re-feed after a period of time can be considered but it is unlikely to be possible after only three hours. In addition, feeding is not a primary concern in the acute state. Although performing an echocardiography can be part of the management plan it is not a priority at this stage, particularly as the saturations improved with supplemental oxygen. CBC and CRP can guide the diagnosis, but treatment should be started immediately (within 1 hour) as the bacterial growth doubles every one hour. "

pediatrics,589,Which of the following is regarded as an indication for tonsillectomy?,More than 3 episodes per year of tonsillitis requiring antibiotics for 3 successive years,Peritonsillar abscess,Persistently enlarged tonsils,Recurrent glue ear requiring grommet insertion,Snoring,A,"The indications for tonsillectomy are controversial. Undoubtedly, upper airway obstruction, particularly if associated with hypoxaemia or apnoea, is a clear indication. In most cases, recurrent tonsillitis with pus requiring antibiotic therapy more than three times a year for three successive years would encourage the surgeon to remove the tonsils. This is particularly the case if there has been a previous abscess. However, if there is no history of chronic tonsillitis, the chance of a recurrence of quinsy is only about 10%, so isolated incision and drainage with antibiotics is all that is required. "

pediatrics,601,A 15-year-old boy who has recently arrived in the United Kingdom is brought to clinic with a three month history of fatigue and and breathlessness whilst playing sport. He has recently had several episodes of fainting at school. On examination he is centrally cyanosed with clubbed nails. He has a heart rate of 100 beats per minute and a respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute. He has a right ventricular heave with dual heart sounds and a loud P2. Which is the single most likely diagnosis?,Ebstein's anomaly,Eisenmenger's syndrome,Pulmonary atresia,Tetralogy of Fallot,Ventricular septal defect,B,"Cyanosis occurs due to the shunting of de-oxygenated blood from the right side of the heart into the systemic circulation on the left. Ebstein's anomaly, pulmonary atresia, tetralogy de Fallot and Eisenmenger's syndrome all cause cyanosis. Eisenmenger's syndrome is not a primary cyanotic heart defect, but occurs when left to right blood flow through previously non-cyanotic defect reverses, resulting in right to left flow and cyanosis. Normally pressure in the left ventricle is greater than the right ventricle and blood flows left to right. With persistent shunting of blood into the right ventricle pulmonary pressures increase, leading to pulmonary hypertension (loud P2) and right ventricular hypertrophy (right ventricular heave). Eventually the right-sided pressures exceeds that of the left and the shunt reverses.  Eisenmenger's syndrome typically presents as a teenager or young adult with cyanosis, breathlessness, fatigue, poor exercise tolerance and even syncope. It is more prevalent in resource poor countries where a congenital heart defects (such as large ventricular septal defects) may not have been treated or following delayed surgery. In Ebstein's anomaly the tricuspid valve is set low in the right ventricle. The valve is distorted and displaced, resulting in tricuspid regurgitation, a murmur, and increased right atrial pressures. The natural course of the disease depends upon the severity of the valve displacement and the degree of regurgitation across the valve. Right to left blood flow at the atrial level in the early neonatal period can cause cyanosis before pulmonary pressures fall. Persistent tricuspid regurgitation and right ventricular overload leads to eventual heart failure. In pulmonary atresia there is an imperforate pulmonary valve leading to cyanosis and collapse in the early neonatal period following ductal closure. Tetralogy de Fallot describes a combination of right ventricular out flow tract obstruction, right ventricular hypertrophy, over- riding aorta and ventricular septal defect. There is classically an ejection systolic murmur over the pulmonary area murmur and a history of cyanotic spells, in which there is acute worsening of right ventricular outflow obstruction, cyanosis and hypoxia. Cyanotic spells can occur spontaneously or following triggers, such as stress, exercise or infection and children classically squat to increase their pulmonary blood flow."

pediatrics,603,What is a common cause of death in severely malnourished people?,Infection,Intracranial haemorrhage,Liver failure,Malignancy,Renal failure,A,"Severe malnutrition predisposes to severe infection which is a common cause of death in malnourished people worldwide. Severe malnutrition affects millions of people worldwide and is thought to account for around 50% of deaths in childhood and infancy. Many people with severe malnutrition die of infections. People with malnutrition are more prone to infection and less able to fight off a severe infection compared to well-nourished people of similar age and sex. Unfortunately the causes of malnutrition (poverty, poor access to food, famine, war, conflict) also make infections more likely, through poor water sanitation, disrupted infrastructure for sewerage and close living quarters. Other important causes of death in people with malnutrition include arrhythmias. Malnutrition makes hypokalaemia common, and refeeding a malnourished person can aggravate this electrolyte disturbance, creating an arrhythmogenic environment."
pediatrics,604,"A 4-year old is admitted with a two day history of feeling unwell, fever and has developed bloody diarrhoea. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",Crohn’s disease,Escherichia coli 0157,Giardiasis,Polio,Threadworm infestation,B,Enterohaemorrhagic verocytotoxin-producing E coli 0157:H7 is the most likely cause and is a cause of haemolytic uraemic syndrome. It would be unusual for Crohn's to present as acutely as this. Polio usually first manifests as a non-bloody diarrhoea as does giardiasis.
pediatrics,605,Which of the following conditions is associated with mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene?,Achondroplasia,Huntington disease,Marfan syndrome,Neurofibromatosis type 1,Retinoblastoma,A,"Horton et al.^1 write:  andquot;Achondroplasia is the most common form of short limb dwarfism in human beings, affecting more than 250,000 individuals worldwide. More than 95% of patients have the same point mutation in the gene for fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) and more than 80% of these are new mutations. The mutation, which causes gain of FGFR3 function, affects many tissues, most strikingly the cartilaginous growth plate in the growing skeleton, leading to a variety of manifestations and complications.andquot;  Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by a mutation of the neurofibromin gene (which may act as a tumour suppressor) on chromosome 17q.

pediatrics,606,"A worried mother brings her 3-year-old to the emergency department saying he swallowed some bleach from the house. She gave him milk, which he drank without drooling or vomiting. What is the next most appropriate management option?",Endoscopy should be performed to rule out oesophagitis,Give him antacid to buffer the effect of the bleach,Give him ipecac immediately,Perform gastric lavage immediately,Reassure her that it is a mild irritant and that he will be fine as he has been drinking with no problems,E,"Consultation with a poisons unit would be important in such a case. Household bleach is a mild irritant and causes no tissue destruction. Ipecac and endoscopy are not indicated because bleach is a mild alkali and not caustic. Immediate dilution using milk or water is all that is needed. Gastric lavage has no role. The use of a weak acid to neutralise the alkali is absolutely contraindicated, since this chemical reaction will release both heat and gas which may cause further damage."
pediatrics,607,"A 7-month-old boy presents with a history of cough, fever and difficulty in feeding for three days. He has become progressively more breathless.

pediatrics,610,"You are reviewing options for the treatment of complex partial seizures in a 13-year-old boy. Which of the following agents requires review of dosing after two to three weeks, usually with an increase in total daily dose?",Carbamazepine,Lamotrigine,Phenytoin,Valproate,Vigabatrin,A,"Carbamazepine is a potent p450 enzyme inducer and is subject to the phenomenon of auto induction. This is where it up regulates metabolism of itself, and dose adjustment to increase the total daily dose is therefore usually required after the first two to three weeks of treatment. Whilst phenytoin is also a potent inducer of p450 enzyme series, dose adjustment is not normally required.  Out of the other options listed, it is lamotrigine which is most commonly used because of no significant p450 enzyme interaction, and a relatively clean adverse event profile (is not associated with weight gain, unlike sodium valproate)."
pediatrics,611,"A 7-day-old baby boy presents to the GP because his mother has noticed a blue tinge to his lips and reluctance to feed.

pediatrics,613,A 6-year-old boy had previously been able to pass stools into the toilet without any problems. Over the last six months he has taken to passing stools either behind the family sofa or inside the kitchen cupboards. The family report that he passes a soft sausage shaped stool. With what is this kind of encopresis associated?,Conduct disorder,Enuresis,Excelling at school,Global developmental delay,Lack of fibre in the diet,A,Encopresis is the passage of stools into inappropriate places after the age of 4-years-old. It can be seen if a child is constipated or has overflow incontinence. It may persist from infancy (primary) or may appear after successful toilet training (secondary). Primary encopresis is associated with global developmental delay and enuresis; whereas secondary is associated with conduct disorder and psychosocial stressors such as parent responding with punishment. Children's performances at school may deteriorate.
pediatrics,614,A 4-year-old girl arrives in the Emergency department looking very distressed with audible stridor. Which of the following is true?,Hyperinflation on inspiration and hypoinflation on expiration are indicative of foreign body inhalation,"If suspecting epiglottitis, a supine radiograph will produce optimal results",Steeple sign is associated with epiglottitis,The radiograph in croup classically shows glottic obstruction with a normal epiglottis,"The radiograph in epiglottitis classically shows thickened aryepiglottic folds, subglottic obstruction and inflamed epiglottis",E,"Stridor is a high pitched noise resulting from turbulent airflow through a partially obstructed upper airway. It is a serious clinical sign and requires immediate attention. Hypoinflation on inspiration and hyperinflation on expiration are indicative of foreign body inhalation. The steeple sign is the classical sign of croup with narrowing of the subglottic portion of the trachea with a normal epiglottis. Imaging studies are often not necessary in epiglottitis but if required someone experienced in intubation should accompany the child, keep them calm as possible and lateral views should be taken as the supine position may further close off the airway "
pediatrics,615,A 5-year-old girl is referred to the general paediatric clinic by her GP as she has had constipation since the age of 2 years. Which of the following statements is true for childhood constipation?,Anal dilatation is useful as a surgical adjunct in functional constipation in children,Dietary interventions are usually adequate for the treatment of moderate constipation,Digital rectal examination should always be performed before commencing treatment for constipation,One week of Movicol or other macrogol should be adequate to treat the constipation,Withholding is a common cause of constipation in children over 18 months,E,"Most childhood constipation is functional (idiopathic constipation), that is, constipation that has no physical or physiological cause. Constipation is defined as having a stool that is difficult or painful to pass and often associated with soiling. There are many potential causes of chronic constipation. Social:  Lack of privacy Lack of exercise Poor diet Overfeeding in infancy Problems with school toilets, and Changes in routine/lifestyle (for example, a new sibling).  Psychological:  Poor bowel habit - ignoring the urge or withholding, and Previous difficult toileting experience.  Physical:  Neuropathic - Hirschsprung's (usually presents neonatally), spina bifida, neurofibromatosis, tethered cord Endocrine/metabolic - hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, hypokalaemia, cystic fibrosis, diabetes mellitus, coeliac Connective tissue disorders - scleroderma, Ehlers-Danlos, systemic lupus erythematosus Cow's milk protein intolerance Lead or mercury poisoning Meconium ileus equivalent Anatomic malformation, imperforate anus (neonatal), anal stenosis, pelvic mass Medications - analgesics, iron supplements, anticonvulsants, antispasmodics, antacids Underweight/overweight Fever/dehydration Immobility Position for defecation Local pathology, for example, anal fissure, and Consider child abuse.  There is no evidence to suggest that anal dilatation has a role in the treatment of idiopathic constipation. Dietary interventions should not be used alone as a first line intervention for idiopathic constipation. Laxatives should be used in combination with other lifestyle/diet/behavioural modifications. Do not perform a digital rectal examination in children or young people older than 1 year with a 'red flag' in the history-taking and/or physical examination that might indicate an underlying disorder. Instead, refer them urgently. Maintenance therapy should be started once the bowel is disimpacted and reassessed on several occasions before considering stopping. Some children may require a laxative for the length of time that they have been constipated. Maintenance therapy using macrogol is often commenced at half the disimpaction dose. Withholding is a common cause of constipation once a child is 18 months or older. "

This destruction can be severe and lead to mild blood loss in the urine. The presence of proteinuria and gross haematuria, and the timing of onset of symptoms after an upper respiratory tract infection, make post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis the most likely diagnosis. The timing excludes IgA nephropathy because it occurs with the active disease or within few days rather than after several weeks. Minimal change disease can also be a possibility but the presence of blood in urine makes it unlikely. Lupus nephritis will show a more dramatic presentation with other signs and symptoms. Thin glomerular basement membrane disease is a very rare autosomal dominant disorder. "
pediatrics,617,What advice would you give for the parents of a child with repeated UTI?,Surgery,Prophylactic antibiotics,Increase fluids,Toilet training,Laxatives,B,For repeated UTI prophylactic antibiotic should be given
pediatrics,618,Two strains of Escherichia coli are isolated and both are resistant to ampicillin. Strain A retains its resistance to amplicillin when grown from multiple generations in the absence of ampicillin. However strain B loses its resistance when grown in the absence of ampicillin. Which of the following best explains the loss of antibiotic resistance in strain B?,Changes in the bacterial DNA gyrase,Downregulation of the resistance gene,Loss of a plasmid containing the resistance gene,Mutations in the resistance gene,Transposition of another sequence into the resistance gene,C,Bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics by gaining genes that encode for particular proteins that offer protection to the organism. Sometimes this is by mutation and at other times the gene may be acquired from another bacterial species. The genes are usually found in plasmids - circular segments of DNA separate from the bacterial chromosome. Plasmids can easily spread from one bacteria to another - a sort of resistance package that bacteria can share.
pediatrics,619,"A woman attends the general paediatric clinic with her obese 8-year-old daughter, having been referred by her GP. According to the NICE guidelines, which of the following is recommended as a first line treatment for an obese 8-year-old?",Atkins diet for six months with the aim of losing 1-2 lbs per week,Encourage meals with distraction such as television to encourage less food consumption,Increase physical activity to at least 60 minutes a day,Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,Trial of treatment with orlistat under secondary care supervision for a period of 6 months,C,"Overweight children and families should be encouraged to increase physical activity, improve eating behaviour and eat more healthily with the aim of reducing total energy intake to below expenditure. Referral to suitable community weight control programmes should be considered. The child must also be assessed for co-morbidities and referred as appropriate. Eating behaviour should be improved by reducing total energy intake to below expenditure, without using unduly restrictive diets such as the Atkins diet. Children and young adults should be encouraged to eat regular meals, including breakfast, with all the family eating the same food where possible and without distractions (such as watching television). Children should be encouraged to do at least 60 minutes of at least moderate activity each day, either in one session or several lasting 10 minutes or more. Children who are already overweight may need to do more than 60 minutes' activity. The two bariatric surgical approaches (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and laparoscopic gastric banding) for the treatment of obesity are not generally recommended for obese children or young people and should only be considered in exceptional circumstances. Drug treatment such as orlistat is only recommended for children aged 12 years and over, if they have physical or psychological comorbidities and only after dietary, exercise and behavioural approaches have been tried. The treatment should then be started in secondary care for 6-12 months. "
pediatrics,620,An otherwise healthy 10-month-old baby is brought to clinic by her concerned parents who state that two days ago she had come into close contact with another child who has measles. Which of the following is the most appropriate approach?,Nothing need be done now but she should receive her MMR vaccination at the usual time of approximately 12 months,She should have her measles serology checked now,She should receive measles immunoglobulin now,She should receive the MMR vaccination now,She should receive the MMR vaccine now together with measles immunoglobulin,D,"The child should receive the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination now but the parents should be informed that she may well develop measles. It is best to reassure the parents that if she develops measles it is most likely to be self limiting and is treated appropriately. There is no point in assessing serology or giving immunoglobulin. Single vaccines are not available on the NHS and the child is not immune to mumps or rubella."
pediatrics,621,"At a routine six week check mother raises concerns about her child's vision. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. He is thriving and feeding well. There is no family or social history of note. On examination:    Temperature 36.7°C   RR 30/min   HR 110/min    He is well, well perfused and has no dysmorphic features. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Leucocoria is noted with fixed squint. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Amblyopia,Congenital cataract,Glaucoma,Hypermetropia,Myopia,B,"Congenital cataract is not uncommon. Causes include:  Maternal diabetes Familial (AD, AR, XR) Metabolic (galactosaemia, galactokinase deficiency, Lowe's syndrome) Congenital infection (e.g. rubella) Chromosomal defects (e.g. Down's).  Any disturbance of vision in this age group can rapidly cause amblyopia, so urgent assessment is required. This will include search for underlying disease, cataract removal and patching of the good eye to encourage visual development in the affected eye."
pediatrics,622,"A 6-year-old girl presents with smoky coloured urine of three weeks duration. She has been apyrexial and there are no other urinary symptoms. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she is apyrexial and well. Respiratory rate 15/min and heart rate of 95/min. Her abdomen is soft with no masses palpable. Urine shows 2+ blood, and microscopy shows 30 red cells per high power field. USS KUB shows nephrocalcinosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glomerulonephritis,Haemorrhagic cystitis,Hypercalciuria,Urinary tract infection,Wilm’s tumour,C,"The history of haematuria and nephrocalcinosis suggests a hereditary form of hypercalciuria. This can be confirmed with a timed urine collection. A low calcium diet may be required. Acquired nephrocalcinosis can be caused by diuretics (for example, furosemide) especially in newborns or premature infants."
pediatrics,623,A 7-year-old boy is given codeine phosphate 15 mg after recent surgery for a right arm fracture to help control his pain. The nurses notice he is particularly drowsy afterwards. Which of the following is a genetic polymorphism in which CYP450 enzyme is most likely to be responsible for the exaggerated effect of the codeine?,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,CYP2C8,CYP2C9,CYP1A2,A,"The answer is CYP2D6. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6 are known in particular to affect the metabolism of codeine, beta blockers and some antidepressants. Patients may be hypermetabolisers, leading to reduced therapeutic effect, or have deficient metabolism of these agents, leading in the case of codeine to increased opiate effect, or in the case of beta blockers to exaggerated bradycardia or hypotension. CYP3A4 is responsible for the metabolism of a large number of drugs not including codeine, for this and the other options, significant polymorphisms affecting drug metabolism are not reported."
pediatrics,624,A 13-year-old girl with coeliac disease is bored with her diet and wants to check what she is allowed to eat/use. Which one of the following is gluten free?,Communion wafers,Crisps,Rice,Sausages,Yorkshire puddings,C,"Gluten, which is found in wheat, barley and rye, triggers an immune reaction in people with coeliac disease. It is obvious that gluten is contained in some foods such as bread, pasta and pizzas, but there are also many foods that contain 'hidden' gluten. For a full list, please see the Coeliac UK website. Except for rice, all of the foods listed in the question contain gluten, although it is possible to specially order communion wafers which are gluten free. Rice is gluten free and safe to eat. Oats are also usually safe to eat, although some people are still sensitive to pure oatmeal."
pediatrics,625,"A 15-year-old boy presents to accident and emergency with severe groin pain preventing him from standing. Symptoms started two days ago with mild discomfort resolving with analgesia, but today the pain has become very severe. There is no dysuria or haematuria. On examination he has a fever 38.6°C and there is a red swollen left testicle that is very tender to touch. A firm and tender mass is noted on the posterior aspect of the left testicle, which is warm to touch. There is no apparent change in pain intensity by elevating the testicles. The cremasteric reflex is present. Urine dipstick has shown 21 WBCs per high-power field. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cystitis,Acute epididymitis,Acute idiopathic scrotal oedema,Testicular torsion,Testicular tumour,B,"Acute epididymitis, or inflammation of the epididymis, is characterised by testicular pain that is unilateral, usually seen in post-pubertal males. The classic presentation would be over several days with urethral discharge but it is highly variable. The main differentials in this acute case are acute epididymitis and testicular torsion. However, the latter can be ruled out by several clinical indicators, including gradual onset of pain, no change in pain intensity after elevating the testicles, and the presence of the cremasteric reflex. This can further be confirmed by radionuclide scan, which will show an increased blood flow in epididymitis rather than a reduced blood flow shown in testicular torsion. Acute idiopathic scrotal oedema and testicular tumour are usually painless and show a more gradual onset."
pediatrics,626,"A 14-month-old African boy presents with cervical lymphadenopathy and coryza. He has been unwell for the past three days. He was born at 38+4/40 weighing 2.95 kg and there were no neonatal problems. He was breast fed. He has had recurrent ear infections and gets frequent colds. His immunisations are up to date. His father died in Africa at 34 years of age with TB. On examination the temperature is 38.4°C, with respiratory rate 35/min and pulse 120/min. He is miserable and coryzal. He has marked rubbery enlargement of cervical, axiallary and inguinal nodes. His chest reveals conducted secretions. He has 3 cm liver and 4 cm spleen palpable, both being firm and smooth. What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV,Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Lymphoma,Mycobacterial adenitis,A,"The history of frequent infections, generalised reticuloendothelial enlargement and high risk of exposure make vertical HIV infection the most likely diagnosis. The chest x ray in such cases often reveals bilateral perihilar infiltration of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP). The diagnosis should be confirmed with virus-specific testing (ribonucleic acid [RNA] polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or culture) and co-trimoxizole prophylaxis started to prevent Pneumocystis infection. Depending on the CD4 count and viral load antiretroviral combination therapy may be needed."
pediatrics,627,An 18-month-old boy is brought to clinic. His mother states that she has noticed that he has had five to six watery motions daily and that she has seen pieces of undigested carrots and peas in the stool. Examination reveals a healthy child with weight on the 50th centile and normal development. Abdominal examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Coeliac disease,Cystic fibrosis,Lactose intolerance,Münchausen's syndrome by proxy,Toddler's diarrhoea,E,"Toddler's diarrhoea is associated with the passage of three or more loose stools daily, often smelly and often containing undigested foods. However, progress is unimpaired with normal development and weight gain. Usually reassurance is all that is required, but sometimes a change in diet may be needed."
pediatrics,628,A 2-days-old baby’s mother is worried about the baby’s hearing. Mother has a history of conductive hearing loss. What is the most appropriate test?,Brain stem evoked response,CT,Fork test,MRI,Reassure,A,"A BAER (brainstem auditory evoked response) test can help to diagnose hearing loss and nervous system disorders, especially in newborns, young children, and others who may not be able to participate in a standard hearing test"
pediatrics,629,"A 14-year-old boy returns from a school camping trip in Scotland. Six weeks later he develops a fever, malaise, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. As his fever settles a few days later his urine becomes dark. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination:    Temperature 37.2°C   Respiratory rate 12/min   Pulse 80/min    He has 4 cm of tender smooth hepatomegaly and he is obviously icteric. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Adult polycystic disease,Congestive heart failure,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,Leptospirosis,C,"The history suggests an acute hepatitis six weeks following a time of dubious hygiene. The likely organism is Hepatitis A, a picornavirus, and this can be confirmed by specific IgM titres. Symptoms usually settle over about four weeks. Leptospirosis is commoner in the Tropics and Subtropics, particularly those environments contaminated with rat urine.   "
pediatrics,630,Which of the following statements applies to precocious puberty?,In boys it is usually idiopathic,Is a well recognised sequel to hydrocephalus,Is associated with a normal rate of skeletal maturation,Is less common in girls,Is treated with LHRH antagonists,B,"Precocious puberty is approximately five times more common in females. In females it is usually idiopathic, in males the commonest cause is a hypothalamic hamartoma. Central nervous system disorders such as the following are aetiological factors:  Hydrocephalus Head trauma Cerebral palsy, and Meningitis.  Skeletal maturation is accelerated. The condition is treated with luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists."
pediatrics,631,A 17-year-old female presents after taking an overdose of her grandmother's medication. Investigations revealed a serum potassium of 6 mmol/L (3.5-4.9). Which one of the following drugs is the most likely cause of this abnormality?,Aspirin,Fluoxetine,Omeprazole,Propranolol,Zopiclone,D,"Betablockers, particularly propranolol, in overdose can cause hyperkalaemia by transmembrane shifts. It is useful to think of the opposite - beta-agonists such as salbutamol are far more widely known to cause hypokalaemia. Salicylate overdose causes metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis which can occur either one after the other or in an overlapping way. In adults, typically, the predominant acid base disorder seems to be an alkalosis with a high pH. However, in children under 4-years-old, an acidosis seems to predominate. The reasons for this are unclear. Observational data of patients following a salicylate overdose suggest that hypokalaemia is actually more common than hyperkalaemia in this patient group.  SSRI overdose (e.g. fluoxetine) rarely causes significant pathology unless taken in extremely high doses. It may cause tachycardia and prolonged QT interval. Zopiclone causes excessive drowisness but very rarely would cause respiratory depression. Overdose of digoxin therapy most commonly manifests as rhythm disturbance, and may be exacerbated by hypokalaemia."
pediatrics,632,A mother is concerned because her 1-year-old girl was in contact with measles two days previously. Which one of the following statements is correct?,Gamma globulin can be administered up to 14 days after exposure,If she were to become infected then complications would be extremely rare,Immunisation with the live attenuated virus is advised within 72 hours to confer protection,Nothing can be done to affect the course of the disease,She should anticipate the rash occurring in the next five days,C,"If the person is within 72 hours of exposure measles vaccine is the treatment of choice as it may confer life long immunity, although neither immunoglobulin nor vaccine are 100% effective in preventing measles,. In persons in whom the vaccine is contraindicated immune globulin can be given. Immune globulin is effective within six days of exposure. One third of those afflicted with measles can expect a complication. These include pneumonia, otitis media, diarrhoea. A serious complication is the development of sub-acute sclerosing, pan-encephalitis. The initial symptoms of measles are coryzal symptoms. Several days after the appearance of coryzal symptoms a rash appears. "
pediatrics,633,Which of the following are true of chronic renal failure in childhood?,If accompanied by renal osteodystrophy is likely to be associated with severe hypertension,Is an unusual sequel of acute post-streptococcal glomerulo-nephritis,Is likely to be benefited by administration of corticosteroids,Is the most common sequel to the nephrotic syndrome,Is unlikely to be due to chronic pyelonephritis unless there is a clear history of an acute attack,B,CRF may occur in childhood as a consequence of inherited disorders such as Alport's from recurrent infection and reflux disease. Renal function usually resolves post-streptococcal GN.
pediatrics,634,"You receive an urgent referral from a GP who is concerned an 18-month-old child may have epilepsy. Whenever the child cries and becomes very distressed he appears to go blue around the face, lips and tongue. He then appears to collapse to the floor and his limbs become rigid, occasionally he also has clonic movements of the arms. The mother states that these episodes occur only when the child hurts himself or becomes very frustrated with something. The episodes last only a matter of seconds and then he appears to take a deep breath, regain consciousness and his lips become pink again. What is the best treatment option for this child?",Carbamazepine,Corticosteroids,Lorazepam,Parental reassurance that these episodes will resolve with age,Sodium valproate,D,The history above describes episodes of breath holding attacks. Breath holding attacks typically present between 6 to 18 months of age. They often occur after a frustrating or painful experience when the child cries inconsolably and then holds their breath becoming pale or cyanosed. In some cases the child may lose consciousness and fall to the ground with stiffening of the limbs or clonic movements. No treatment is required and the condition usually resolves with age.
pediatrics,635,"A 17-year-old girl is admitted with a two day history of rigors due to a urinary tract infection. On examination she appears unwell, has a body mass index (BMI) of 31 kg/m^2, a temperature of 39°C; examination is otherwise normal. Initial biochemistry revealed:    Potassium 4 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 7 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Glucose 33 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   pH 7.3 (7.36-7.44)   Standard bicarbonate 14 mmol/L (20-28)   Base deficit -10 mmol/L    Urinalysis negative for ketones. Which one of the following is the best initial treatment for her hyperglycaemia?",Metformin,Metformin plus gliclazide,Fixed rate IV insulin infusion,Variable rate IV insulin infusion,Subcutaneous insulin mixture,D,"This patient has a metabolic acidosis with pH of 7.3 and low bicarbonate, this is most likely due to sepsis. She is likely to have type 2 diabetes given the BMI with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia but does not have diabetic ketoacidosis because the urine is negative for ketones, so would not required fixed rate insulin infusion. It is important that her glycaemia is controlled to promote recovery from the sepsis. This is best achieved with intravenous insulin initially."
pediatrics,636,"A 12-year-old girl presents to the GP with a four week history of painful, red, shiny 'lumps' on both shins. She has been feeling non-specifically unwell with a cough for three months and has lost at least half stone without trying. What is the most appropriate investigation to determine the underlying condition?",Anti-streptolysin O titre,Chest x ray,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),HLA-B27 antigen testing,Skin biopsy,B,"Erythema nodosum is being described. This is an inflammatory disease of skin and subcutaneous tissues. In up to half of cases of erythema nodosum the cause is unknown. Causes of erythema nodosum include:  Idiopathic Streptococcal infection Tuberculosis Leptospirosis Epstein-Barr infection Herpes simplex virus infection Sulphonamides Oral contraceptive pill Systemic lupus erythematosus Crohn's Ulcerative colitis Behcet syndrome Sarcoidosis, and Hodgkin disease.  ESR will definitely be raised and will fall as the erythema nodosum resolves, but does not indicate the underlying cause. Skin biopsy is not required. Erythema nodosum is usually a clinical diagnosis. Chest x ray would be important to rule out an underlying primary tuberculosis, especially with the cough, weight loss and non-specific malaise. Anti-streptolysin O titre - this only indicates past exposure to streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection. The chronicity of the symptoms suggest that an upper respiratory tract infection is not the cause. HLA-B27 antigen testing does not indicate the cause. Erythema nodosum is associated with HLA-B27 positive individuals."
pediatrics,637,"A 3-year-old boy presents with a rash on the face. It has appeared two days after he accidentally scratched his face. The rash has been worsening over the past three to four days. A similar rash appeared yesterday on his trunk. He was born at 39/40 weighing 2.97 kg and there were no neonatal problems. He is fully immunised, on no medication, and there is no family history of note. On examination his temperature is 36.5°C (tympanic), RR 15/min and HR 95/min. He has eight raised lesions 2-5 mm across around his mouth and three more on this trunk. They have a golden crust. He has enlarged glands in the neck. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Impetigo,Measles,Molluscum contagiosum,Scabies,Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,A,"The history of golden crusted lesions in this distribution suggests non-bullous impetigo. This is often auto-inoculated to other parts of the body via the fingernails. Regional lymph nodes are often enlarged. In bullous impetigo, flaccid bullae develop which may be considerably larger. Treatment is with antibiotics, particularly to cover Staph. aureus. Typically these will be given topically (providing all lesions can be treated easily) +/- orally.   "

pediatrics,640,Which of the following statements is correct regarding basic life support (BLS) in an infant?,Cardiac compression should be performed where the pulse is absent during palpation of 10 seconds,Five rescue breaths should be administered to the nose and mouth,The carotid pulse is palpated,The head should be in a flexed position,The palm of the hand is used to perform cardiac compression,B,"In BLS in an infant the head position should be neutral. The infant's trachea is short and soft and may easily become compressed if the neck is extended. In an older child the head should be placed in a 'sniffing the air' (neck slightly extended) position to improve the airway. Resuscitation is commenced when there is an absent pulse for 10 seconds combined with other signs (no normal breathing, no spontaneous movement, no response to stimuli). An absent pulse alone is not enough as it can be difficult to feel. The infant's neck is short and fat and the carotid pulse may be difficult to identify, therefore the brachial or femoral pulse is palpated. Once the airway is checked, five initial slow rescue breaths are given; rapid breaths cause gastric distension. If there is no response, 15 chest compressions, 2 rescue breaths, and a further 15 chest compressions are given. Thereafter the C:V ratio should be 15 :2. The compression rate should be at least 100 and not more than 120/minute. Two fingers are used to perform chest compressions for infants (or the hand encircling technique with both hands encircling the chest). The fingers should be placed one finger breadth above the xiphisternum. Compression should be 1/3 of the AP diameter of the chest. "
pediatrics,641,A 15-month-old baby girl presented to the emergency department with difficulty in breathing. Examination: she has intercostal recessions and a wheeze. Temperature normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,URTI,Pneumonia,Bronchiolitis,RDS,Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency,C,Asthma and bronchiolitis has similar sign symptoms. The difference is in pathology. In asthma there is bronchoconstriction but in bronchiolitis there is oedema of the airway wall. In infants and younger children bronchiolitis is commoner than asthma and it is seen that many of the children with bronhiolitis usually followed by asthma

He recovers quickly and continues playing. Two hours later he complains of headache, begins vomiting then loses consciousness. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he responds only to deep pain. He is apyrexial with respiratory rate of 10/min (irregular), pulse of 40/min. He has a large bruise in the right temporal area. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral contusion,Contrecoup injury,Extradural haematoma,Subdural haematoma,Tonsillar herniation,C,"The history is of a closed head injury, followed by a lucid period followed by decreasing level of consciousness. The time course suggests an extradural haematoma, where there is arterial bleeding which accumulates rapidly outside the dura causing raised intracranial pressure. Subdural haematoma in infants may accompany massive axon injury in 'Shaken baby syndrome', and presents acutely. Retinal haemorrages are often present. (Chronic subdurals due to birth trauma can present much later due to the open fontanelle.) Epidural haematoma, typically from a torn middle meningeal artery and associated with skull fracture, accumulates much more rapidly. There may be apparent recovery from the initial concussion, but deterioration is usually within 15-30 minutes. "
pediatrics,644,A 4-year-old boy presents with an acute onset of bruising and multiple small red non-blanching spots. He is otherwise well and there are no other symptoms.

The condition typically affects children aged between 1- and 5-years-old and presents with purpura, petechiae, nosebleeds or bruising. The child is otherwise well and classically this follows a viral illness. Of note there are no other features indicative of leukaemia or lymphoma. Up to 90% of cases will resolve spontaneously within six months. Treatment is only initiated if there is severe bleeding. This consists of intravenous immunoglobin, steroids, splenectomy (but only if there is life threatening bleeding), immunosuppresives and occasionally platelet transfusions (although these will be rapidly cleared)."
pediatrics,645,"A 15-month-old child is playing alone while her mother is preparing her supper.

The ambulance crew give oxygen. On arrival she has O2 saturations of 97% in air. Her respiratory rate is 20/ minute, and there is no recession. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Factitious and induced illness,Gastroesophageal reflux and aspiration,Inhalation of foreign body,Pertussis,D,"The history is suggestive of aspiration of a small object. Often there is acute coughing, then symptoms settle. It is important to do a chest x ray to identify any radio-opaque object. Remember that non-opaque objects will not show up, but that secondary inflammation may follow resulting in chronic problems, for example, right middle lobe bronchiectasis."

pediatrics,654,"An 11-year-old girl with scoliosis was admitted to hospital for further spinal surgery and was found to be colonised with MRSA. Prior to her surgery, which of these would be the most appropriate treatment regimes for eradication of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonisation?",Nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine wash for five days,"Nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine wash for 14 days, repeated if required",Nasal mupirocin only for 14 days,Oral fusidic acid,Oral vancomycin,A,"MRSA is any strain of Staphylococcus aureus that has developed resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics, which include the penicillins (methicillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, etc.) and the cephalosporins. MRSA screening in children should be performed only in high risk patients; in this example the patient is about to undergo open surgery so should be checked for colonisation and eradicated where appropriate. In this scenario the most appropriate treatment would be nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine wash for five days. Nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine wash should be used several times a day for up to seven days, local protocols vary slightly. Nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine wash for 14 days, repeated if required, is incorrect as further drug resistance is likely to occur if prolonged or repeated courses of eradication are used. Nasal mupirocin only for 14 days is incorrect as a body wash should be used as well as nasal treatment. Oral fusidic acid and oral vancomycin are both incorrect since oral medication is insufficient to eradicate nasal carriage of MRSA. "

pediatrics,656,"A cochlear implant is a device designed to create an alternative hearing pathway for people of all ages with bilateral, severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss. Which of the following normal structures of the ear are directly electrically stimulated by the electrodes in a cochlear implant?",Auditory nerve ganglion cells,Intracochlear hair cells,Ossicles,Oval window,Round window,A,A cochlear implant bypasses the mechanical structures of the normal hearing pathway and provides a direct electrical stimulus to the spiral ganglion cells of the auditory nerve. Sensorineural hearing loss results from damage to or death of the intracochlear hair cells. These normally are the transducers of the mechanical energy transmitted to the cochlear into the electrical impulse required to initiate an action potential in the auditory nerve.
pediatrics,657,"A 5-year-old boy with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) attends an outpatient clinic for routine follow-up. His mother states that she has noticed some pink discolouration to his urine, which she is concerned may be blood staining. He is otherwise asymptomatic from a urological perspective. You undertake a urine dipstick, which is positive for blood. Which of the following is associated with BWS and must be investigated for?",Nephroblastomatosis,Neuroblastoma,Renal stones,Vesico-ureteric reflux,Wilms' tumour,E,"BWS is associated with macroglossia, organomegaly, exomphalos, and Wilms' tumour. There are other syndromes associated with Wilms' tumour that can be divided into those that are associated with overgrowth phenotypes and those that are not. Overgrowth phenotype syndromes associated with Wilms' tumour:  BWS Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome (similar to BWS with Xq26 gene mutation) Isolated hemi-hypertrophy Sotos syndrome (cerebral gigantism), and Perlman syndrome (fetal overgrowth, renal hamartomas, and nephroblastomatosis.  Non-overgrowth phenotype syndrome associated with Wilms' tumour:  WAGR syndrome (Wilms', aniridia, genitourinary anomalies, and mental retardation) Trisomy 18 Denys-Drash syndrome (nephropathy, gonadal dysgenesis), and Bloom syndrome (distinct facies, short stature, hypogonadism, widespread cancer risk).  Despite the above syndromic associations, the majority of Wilm's tumours are sporadic (greater than90%). Investigation includes:  ultrasound/CT/MRI bone/brain scan (to identify metastases) echocardiogram (assess right atrial involvement) arteriography (pre-operative planning +/− embolisation), and DMSA.  Management varies across the world. In Europe, treatment commonly involves chemotherapy to down stage the tumour, followed by surgery. In America, surgery is generally preferred as the initial treatment. Long-term survival can be achieved in greater than90% with stage 1-3 tumours and greater than70% in those with metastatic disease. Nephroblastomatosis is the presence of nephrogenic rests/foci of metanephric blastema in the renal parenchyma that persist beyond 36 weeks' gestation and have the potential for malignant transformation into Wilms' tumour. They are found in patients with BWS, hemi-hypertrophy, and WAGR, but would not be symptomatic causing haematuria. "

What is the single investigation most likely to lead to diagnosis?",Blood for C&S,ESR,CXR,Urine for C&S,CSF analysis,E,"It is really very difficult to differentiate between encephalitis and meningitis. Encephalitis is mostly viral and in UK herpes simplex virus is the main cause. Meningitis also has a viral predominance though less than encephalitis. Because encephalitis involves infection of the brain itself, symptoms of altered brain function-- like confusion or decreased alertness--are usually present, while in cases of meningitis the patient is initially alert and, though understandably distracted by pain and misery, still in command of their mental processes. As CSF can not differentia between meningitis and encephalitis we have to take help of imaging like MRI. In herpes simplex encephalitis there is characteristic hyperintensity in fronto-temporal region. In the given case there are features of raised intracranial pressure like drowsiness and seizer and so we cannot proceed for LP unless guided by CT (or MRI). On the other hand there is no other option that can be diagnostic of the given condition. So we have to happy with CSF analysis as the key though at this moment we have to withheld this procedure"
pediatrics,659,A child was admitted to hospital with a marked hyperkalaemia resulting from an episode of oliguric renal failure. The house officer is instructed to perform an ECG and stabilise the patient. Which of the following should be used initially to lower the serum potassium?,Calcium gluconate,Calcium resonium,Digoxin,Glucose insulin infusion,Hydrocortisone,D,"True hyperkalaemia is a medical emergency and there are three main goals. Firstly, stabilise the myocardial cell membrane to prevent lethal cardiac arrhythmia (and to gain time to shift potassium intracellularly and enhance potassium elimination) - intravenous (IV) calcium chloride or gluconate. Secondly, enhance cellular uptake of potassium:  Sodium bicarbonate IV Regular insulin and glucose IV. Care must be taken using this as although very effective can cause marked hypoglycaemia if not monitored carefully. Beta-adrenergic agents, such as salbutamol.  Thirdly, enhancing total body potassium elimination  Sodium or calcium polystyrene sulfonate (calcium resonium) orally/rectally Furosemide (only if renal function is maintained) Emergent haemodialysis.  Calcium gluconate is used to stabilise the myocardium. It is very important in the emergency management of hyperkalaemia, but does not actually reduce serum potassium. Calcium resonium does reduce the serum potassium but its onset of action is 2-12 hours. Digoxin toxicity can exacerbate hyperkalaemia Although hyperkalaemia can be caused by Addison's disease the addition of hydrocortisone does not reduce serum potassium in the acute phase. "

General features include:  Ninety per cent are seen on antenatal USS - a portion of the spinal cord and surrounding structures develop outside the body Increased alphafetoprotein Spina bifida occulta (up to 10% of people) - mild. Failure of vertebral development - hairy patch or dimple Meningocele - contains meninges and cerebrospinal fluid Myelomenigocele - This is a serious form. Cyst also contains nerves and spinal cord. Surgical scar - lumbosacral lesion (meningocele or meningomyelocele).  Associated problems include:  Hydrocephalus in 80-90%, which is caused by displacement of the fourth ventricle - obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid drainage Scoliosis, contractures Ulcers and pressure sores (from sensory neuropathy) Incontinence of faeces and urine UTIs (increased risk of reflux) Eyes - amblyopia secondary to squint Learning difficulties Seizures.  Studies have shown that as many as 70% of cases of spina bifida could be prevented by adequate folic acid intake. A neural tube defect (NTD) -affected pregnancy increases a woman's chance to have another NTD-affected pregnancy by approximately 20 times. Advising the patient to take 400 mcg folic acid daily before conception and during the first trimester would be appropriate if the woman was not at a high risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. Advising the patient to take folic acid as soon as she finds out she is pregnant is incorrect. Neural tube defects occur at days 21-28 after conception which is often before a woman realises she is pregnant. Therefore folic acid should always be started before conception where possible. Advising the patient not try to conceive further children as the chances of anencephaly are so high is not correct as there are appropriate measures that a woman can take to reduce the risk of a further child with spina bifida."
pediatrics,670,"You see a 7-year-old girl in the outpatient clinic with a 4 month history of intermittent central abdominal pain. Each episode lasts a few hours, on a few occasions per month.

Sixty-nine percent of children with CAP visit a doctor at least once. Only 5-10% of these will have an underlying identifiable organic cause. The above patient fulfils the criteria for a diagnosis of CAP. This is commonly defined as three or more episodes of abdominal pain over at least 3 months' duration that is severe enough to affect daily activities in a child over 3 years of age. She has typical history and examination findings of a patient with functional abdominal pain; the discomfort is localised around the peri-umbilical region, she is growing and developing normally, and there are no alarm symptoms or signs suggestive of underlying organic disease. Alarm symptoms and signs associated with a higher prevalence of organic disease include:  Involuntary weight loss/failure to thrive Gastrointestinal bleeding Chronic, severe diarrhoea or vomiting (note that some vomiting can occur in functional abdominal pain) Persistent right upper quadrant or right lower quadrant (RLQ) abdominal pain Unexplained fever Family history of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) Jaundice Urinary symptoms, back or flank pain, and Abnormal examination findings.  Current evidence suggests the optimal management strategy for patients with functional abdominal pain (FAP) is as follows:  Undertake a coeliac screen (common and can present with non-specific abdominal pain). No need for other investigations. If coeliac screen is negative, diagnose and manage as FAP. Reassure and educate on FAP. Focus on normal functioning as an aim rather than complete resolution of pain. Consider psychological and pharmacological interventions if the pain persists.  "

What is the chance that the second child will be affected?,It is very unlikely because Hirschsprung's disease is not thought to be genetic in origin,Familial involvement only occurs if there is total colonic aganglionosis or small bowel involvement and hence it is very unlikely your second child will be affected,There is a 30% chance in a male sibling and 5% chance in a female sibling,A female sibling would be at higher risk than a male sibling,In short-segment Hirschsprung's disease the risk of a male sibling being affected is 5% and a female sibling 1%,E,"The incidence of familial occurrence in Hirschsprung's disease varies from 2% to 18%. Genetic studies have identified at least 10 mutations in different genes associated with its development. The most common are:  RET gene (7-35%) EDNRB gene (7%), and END3 gene (less than5%).  The risk of familial occurrence increases with the length of aganglionosis. In short-segment Hirschsprung's disease, male siblings have a 5% risk and female siblings 1% risk. Male relatives of females with long-segment disease have the highest risk at 25% for brothers and 30% for sons. It is not known why the condition affects males more frequently than females. Hirschsprung's disease is associated with:  Trisomy 21 MEN type 2 Neurofibromatosis Anorectal malformations Waardenburg's syndrome Cardiac septal defects, and Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome.

On examination he is apyrexial, well and well grown. He has no dysmorphic features. Respiratory rate is 12/min and pulse is 70/mim, blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. Abdominal examination is normal. 3+ proteinuria is confirmed on dipstix testing of the urine. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glomerulonephritis,Nephrotic syndrome,Orthostatic proteinuria,Transient proteinuria (benign),Urinary tract infection,C,"The history is one of isolated proteinuria with no symptoms. Daytime samples may exhibit proteinuria, but overnight and early morning samples may be clear. There are no clinical features here (such as oedema) to suggest nephrotic syndrome. It is important to exclude orthostatic proteinuria. In this condition, which is thought to be benign, urine protein excretion is normal when supine but rises on standing. Prolonged collections in each position confirm the diagnosis. Annual monitoring of urine dipstix and blood pressure is probably advisable as the long-term prognosis is uncertain. However, patients presenting with a persistent proteinuria in the primary care setting would usually require referral to secondary care for further investigation to rule out other diagnoses. "
pediatrics,674,Which one of the following statements correctly applies to leukaemia in childhood?,Commonly presents with bone pain,High white cell count at diagnosis carries a good prognosis,More common in adolescence than the toddler age group,Myeloid leukaemia is commoner than lymphoblastic leukaemia,Strong familial incidence,A,"Leukaemia classically causes bone pain due to marrow infiltration. High blast count is a poor prognostic sign. However initially white blood cell count may be low as blasts may not be detected on the film, so this is unhelpful. The incidence is lower in adolescence and the disease carries a more unfavourable prognosis. Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia is the most common malignant haematological disorder in children.

His mother states he is having approximately 10 episodes of diarrhoea per day, they are very watery. She is not sure if he is passing urine as the nappies are always heavily wet from the diarrhoea. At first he was drinking well but over the last three days he has become increasingly sleepy and so has been drinking less. His mother is also concerned as the times when he is awake he appears agitated and has been crying inconsolably. She states he seems to have lost a significant amount of weight. On examination the infant is sleeping peacefully, there is nothing to find on examination except that his skin has a doughy feel to it. Blood tests are sent and reveal:    Na+ 160 mmol/L   Urea 12 mmol/L   Random glucose 4.6 mmol/L    What is the most appropriate option for the management of this child?",Rehydration with intravenous 5% dextrose aiming to correct dehydration and reduce sodium level to normal over 12 hours,Rehydration with intravenous 5% dextrose aiming to correct dehydration and reduce sodium level to normal over 24 hours,Rehydration with intravenous 0.45% saline/5% dextrose to correct dehydration and reduce sodium level to normal over 24 hours.,Rehydration with intravenous 0.45% saline/5% dextrose to correct dehydration and reduce sodium level to normal over 48 to 72 hours.,Rehydration with intravenous 0.45% saline/2.5% dextrose to correct dehydration and reduce sodium level to normal over 48 to 72 hours,D,"This question is specifically dealing with the management of hypernatraemic dehydration. In hypernatraemic dehydration there is a shift of water from the intracellular fluid compartments into the extracellular fluid compartments to maintain an equal osmolality inside and outside the cells, this results in cellular dehydration. Due to this the signs of hypernatraemic dehydration may often be subtle (although doughy skin is characteristic), the impact however can be devastating. Brain cells are particularly susceptible to the cell shrinkage which occurs secondary to the loss of water. This can tear cerebral blood vessels leading to cerebral haemorrhage, seizures, paralysis and encephalopathy. Rehydration in children with prolonged hypernatraemic dehydration must be cautious as rapid rehydration with hypotonic fluids my result in cerebral oedema and death. Recommendations are that hypernatraemic dehydration should be corrected gradually over 48-72 hours. The sodium level should not be dropped by more than 10-12 mmol/L in any 24 hour period. The best method of rehydration would be with oral rehydration solution if the child is well enough to drink this. Otherwise gradual intravenous fluids are required, calculating for the level of dehydration. Fluids containing sodium should be given so as to not drop the sodium level too rapidly. These fluids should contain glucose as this is also important in maintaining plasma osmolality and ensuring the child is normoglycaemic. If the child has an associated hyperglycaemia with their hypernatraemia it is appropriate to give 2.5% dextrose instead of 5% dextrose but in this case the child has a normal random blood glucose level."
pediatrics,676,"A 3-year-old girl presents with fever, worsening over the past three days. She has also complained of suprapubic abdominal pain and discomfort passing urine. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There was no FH/SH of note. On examination:    Temperature 38.5°C   Respiratory rate 20/min   Heart rate 100/min    She is alert and well perfused. She has mild suprapubic tenderness. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Nephroblastoma,Pneumococcal bacteraemia,Septic arthritis,Urinary tract infection,Viral infection,D,"The history of fever in association with abdominal pain and urinary symptoms suggests a UTI. Specific urinary symptoms may be absent in the younger child, so all febrile children should have a urine dipstix. A culture, preferably a mid-stream urine or catheter specimen, should be sent if any leucocytes, protein, blood or nitrites are present. A second specimen taken prior to starting antibiotics should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Further investigations are not required, unless she does not respond rapidly to treatment.

pediatrics,677,"A 16-year-old male is admitted with an acute infection. He has had a history of similar infections in the past, all attributed to Neisserial organisms. Which of the following immune deficiencies is he likely to have?",C1 inhibitor,C2,C3,C5,Lymphocytes,D,Defiencies of late complement 5-9 are associated with recurrent neisserial or capsulated bacterial infections.
pediatrics,678,Which ONE of the following is associated with Marfan's syndrome?,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Cognitive impairment,Increased upper:lower body ratio,Pulmonary stenosis,Retinal detachment,E,"Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition associated with ocular abnormalities such as upwards lens dislocation and retinal detachment^1. It is associated with a number of other ocular abnormalities, including:  myopia increased axial globe length corneal flatness subluxation of the lenses (ectopia lentis) early glaucoma, and early cataracts.  About 6 out of 10 people with Marfan syndrome have dislocated lenses in one or both eyes. Aortic regurgitation (not pulmonary stenosis) may be a finding and aneurysmal dilatation is a feature. Other associated cardiovascular respiratory complications include:  mitral valve prolapse aortic aneurysms cardiac conduction defects emphysema pneumothorax, and kyphoscoliosis.  Upper to lower body ratio (head to symphysis pubis:symphysis pubis to toes) is decreased in Marfan Syndrome. Other common physical traits include:  long arms, legs and fingers tall and thin body type scoliosis pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum flexible joints flat feet, and crowded teeth.  "
pediatrics,679,"An 18-year-old woman presents with red, tender lumps on her shins and arthralgia. Chest x ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and clear lung fields. A clinical diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made. Which one of the following is the most appropriate management plan?",24 hour urinary calcium measurement,Follow up appointment with chest x ray in three months,Mediastinoscopy and lymph node biopsy,Skin biopsy,Thoracic CT scan,B,"This is also known as Löfgren's syndrome (a benign form of sarcoidosis). The presentation of erythema nodosum, arthropathy, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy syndrome is so characteristic that histological diagnosis is not necessary. The prognosis is excellent with less than 10% having persistent disease. With less characteristic presentations, positive biopsies are needed. Mediastinoscopy is the method of choice for anterior mediastinal nodes."
pediatrics,680,A young child is admitted with severe sepsis. The blood tests demonstrate a platelet count of 50 ×10^9/L (150-400). Which one of the following conditions may explain the thrombocytopenia?,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Kawasaki disease,Leukaemia in remission,Vitamin K deficiency,A,"Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a complication of sepsis and many other severe illnesses. It is characterised by intravascular activation of coagulation causing consumption of platelets and thrombosis. If sufficiently severe DIC can lead to organ failure. Although the initial insult may be localised to one body area, DIC is a systemic condition. The causes of DIC include:  severe sepsis and septic shock malignancy obstetric disease, e.g. eclampsia, abruption, amniotic fluid embolism rheumatological disease severe liver disease, and transfusion reactions.  The platelet count will be reduced in acute leukaemia due to bone marrow infiltration by blasts, but is normal in remission. In Kawasaki disease there will be thrombocytosis. DIC is characterised by low platelets and abnormal clotting profile. In Henoch-Schönlein purpura there will be a normal clotting profile and platelet count. Vitamin K deficiency causes a prolonged prothrombin time and no thrombocytopenia."
pediatrics,681,"A 2-year-old girl presents with redness and swelling of the left cheek. A few days previously she had accidentally scratched herself in this area. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 38.3°C, RR 20/min, HR 100/min. There is a graze on her left cheek, which is red, oedematous and painful to touch. She has tender submandibular nodes on that side. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cellulitis,Erythrasma,Folliculitis,Parvovirus infection,Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome,A,"The history of skin break followed by inflammation and adenopathy suggests a cellulitis. The commonest organisms are Staph. aureus, Strep. pyogenes, Pneumococcus and Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) (if unimmunised). Risk factors for cellulitis include:  skin breaks nephrotic syndrome diabetes, and immunosuppression."
pediatrics,682,A 4-year-old boy is referred to Community Paediatrics because school staff believe he is on the autistic spectrum. He only uses three words and increasingly appears not to understand what is said to him. His parents are very worried and tell you that before he started school he could speak in full sentences. His hearing test and audiometry are normal. In clinic he smiles and has good eye contact but uses no speech. Which referral would most aid diagnosis?,Child psychology and autism diagnostic screening,Electrophysiology for EEG (electroencephalogram),Radiology for cerebral angiography,Radiology for brain MRI,Social services child protection team,B,"This boy may be presenting with Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS), a rare but important form of epilepsy that impairs a child's ability to understand and use language. Children usually have normal developmental progress before losing language skills between the ages of 2 and 10 years. Behaviour changes are also common. Boys are twice as likely to be affected as girls. LKS may be associated with obvious seizures but much of the electrical activity is subclinical, impairing all language-related skills. This is reflected in the 'continuous spike and wave' sequence on EEG, so electrophysiology for EEG is the most appropriate option here.  LKS is often detected late after investigations for autism, deafness, selective mutism, and behavioural problems have been exhausted. Anticonvulsants, steroids, and surgery may be used to control LKS but many children have long-term language and social-communication issues. There is insufficient evidence that this child is on the autistic spectrum, so a referral to child psychology and autism diagnostic screening would be inappropriate. He maintains eye contact and social behaviour and has no history of obsessions, sensory concerns, or difficulty deviating from routine. Autistic features are often present before the age of 4 years. Radiology for cerebral angiography is used to investigate vascular malformations of the head and neck, which may be an underlying cause of temporal lobe epilepsy and intractable epilepsies. In this case, such specific loss of language skills makes vascular malformation unlikely. Radiology for brain MRI would assess for space-occupying lesions and structural abnormalities that may cause progressive skill loss. MRI is important but would not diagnose LKS. A referral to social services child protection team must be considered carefully for all children who present with behaviour changes. Social services referral may need to be undertaken in parallel to clinical assessment. Referral is incorrect in this case because underlying medical causes must be sought via appropriate clinical investigations. "
pediatrics,683,"A 14-year-old boy noticed breast development, which is visible through clothing, causing him distress at school. His father started puberty at 14-years-old and has no known health problems. There is no other past medical history. He is well grown (height 50th centile), with no obvious dysmorphic features. There is very sparse pubic hair and testes of 2 ml volume, and obvious bilateral gynaecomastia. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Constitutional delayed puberty,Kallmann syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Physiological gynaecomastia,Testicular tumour,C,"This patient has gynaecomastia with pubertal delay indicated by the low testicular volume. The most likely diagnosis from the list is Klinefelter's. Constitutional delay is unlikely with gynaecomastia, though it would be in keeping with the family history. Physiological gynaecomastia is usually associated with puberty (with elevated oestrogens), which is unlikely as the patient is pre-pubertal. Both Kallmann and Klinefelter's could give the presenting features of normal height with pubertal delay. Kallmann syndrome is associated with anosmia (sometimes visual problems), is lower incidence (1/10,000-80,000 vs 1/500-1000 respectively) and less frequently associated with gynaecomastia than Klinefelter's."
pediatrics,684,A 6-week-old male is diagnosed with congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. He is found to have hypokalaemia. Which of the following is the cause of the hypokalaemia in this condition?,Associated type IV renal tubular acidosis,Intracellular potassium shift,Metabolic alkalosis producing a paradoxical renal loss of potassium ions,Paradoxical metabolic renal tubular acidosis,Upper gastrointestinal losses,E,"The hypokalaemia in pyloric stenosis is due to gastrointestinal losses as generally there is renal conservation of potassium. Also, the alkalosis is associated with loss of H^+ ions again through vomiting and the effort to conserve these with the production of an alkaline urine."
pediatrics,685,"A 4-year-old child with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia who is currently receiving chemotherapy presents for evaluation, as his older brother developed a rash consistent with chickenpox. The child is afebrile and physical examination is unremarkable. Hb is 110 g/L and WBC is 8 ×10^9/L. What is the next most appropriate step in management of this case?",Admission into hospital for observation and isolation,Administration of intravenous aciclovir,Administration of varicella vaccine,Administration of zoster immune globulin,Continued observation at home,D,"Prevention of infection in an immunocompromised patient is of extreme importance. Therefore, this patient exposed to an older sibling with active varicella, would benefit from post exposure prophylaxis with zoster immunoglobulin. If the immunosuppressed patient exposed to varicella develops clinical disease, then he should receive either parenteral or oral aciclovir. This patient does not require hospital admission for the time being as his WBC count and haemoglobin levels are within normal levels and the child is afebrile."
pediatrics,686,Which of the following is associated with hypernatraemia?,Cholera,Pyloric stenosis,Inappropriate ADH secretion,Diabetes insipidus,Diabetes mellitus,D,"Cholera results in excessive water and sodium losses and hence hyponatraemia. Pyloric stenosis typically results in hypokalaemic, hypochloraemic, metabolic alkalosis and not cause hypernatraemia. Inappropriate ADH secretion causes hyponatraemia. In Diabetes insipidus failure to concentrate urine results in hypernatraemic dehydration with hyperosmolarity. Poorly controlled diabetes results in osmotic diuresis and renal sodium loss."
pediatrics,687,"A 15-month-old girl presents with stridor and respiratory distress. She has had a crusty nasal discharge for two days with low grade fever. She went to bed as usual at 8 pm, but awoke two hours later. Previous history was unremarkable. On examination she has a fever of 37.8°C (tympanic), RR of 55/min (crying), and HR of 150/min. She has marked stridor with moderate recession and a barking cough. O2 saturations are 95% in air. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylaxis,Croup,Foreign body aspiration,Peritonsillar abscess,Retropharyngeal abscess,B,"The history suggests a viral croup (laryngotracheobronchitis). Oral dexamethasone or inhaled budesonide are effective in reducing symptoms, but are not required in mild cases. Reassurance of the mother often calms down both child and mother."
pediatrics,688,You are a doctor on the medical ward caring for a patient with anorexia nervosa. She has been severely malnourished. What abnormality on blood testing might be typical before refeeding starts?,Increased albumin,Increased creatinine,Increased haemoglobin,Reduced bilirubin,Reduced haemoglobin,E,"Anaemia is common in severely malnourished patients. Patients with anorexia nervosa or other cause of severe malnutrition often have multiple abnormalities on blood testing. Haemoglobin is often low, causing anaemia. Deficiencies in iron, folic acid and vitamin B12 may also occur so microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic anaemia are all possible in this situation. Lymphocytes, glucose, K^+, Na^+, PO4^−, Ca2^+ and Mg2^+ are also often low. Urea and creatinine typically fall, due to low muscle bulk. However, reduced excretion rates often mean the resulting levels are only slightly lower than normal. Albumin levels fall in malnutrition and with inflammation. Concomitant vitamin/mineral deficiencies are common; consider testing for the individual vitamins and minerals if possible. In malnutrition, the body's response to infection may be blunted. In serious infection, changes in CRP and WCC may occur more slowly or not at all. If you suspect infection, perform a careful clinical examination and consider requesting a chest x ray, stool culture, blood culture and urinalysis."
pediatrics,689,A 18-year-old girl presents with anxiety and palpitations. Her mother had been treated for an overactive thyroid gland having received radioiodine and was now on thyroxine replacement therapy. On examination she had a pulse of 104 bpm with a fine tremor and lid lag. There was no goitre palpable. Investigations revealed:    Serum free T4 33 pmol/L (10-22)   Plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) less than0.05 (0.4-5)   Serum antithyroid peroxidase (anti TPO) titre 40 U/L (less than50)    What is the most likely cause of her symptoms?,Factitious thyrotoxicosis,Familial hyperthyroglobulinaemia,Graves' disease,Hashitoxicosis,Riedel's thyroiditis,C,"Although the lead-in might make you think that this patient could gain access to thyroxine and so a diagnosis of factitious hyperthyroidism is possible, in practice this is extremely unlikely. Factitious hyperthyroidism is rare and it is important to exclude other causes before jumping to this conclusion. You can measure the serum thyroglobulin, which is low in facticious hyperthyroidism. A strong family history of thyrotoxicosis is typical for Graves' disease; only 85% of patients with Graves' disease have positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and therefore their absence does not preclude the diagnosis. The absence of a goitre is also compatible with a diagnosis of Graves' (in addition, a goitre may not be detectable clinically, and may only be seen on imaging)."
pediatrics,690,Which one of the following is correct with regard to a 4-year-old boy who is to be admitted to hospital for an orchidopexy?,A period of behaviour regression on returning home is to be anticipated,Bringing a furry toy or blanket with him constitutes an unacceptable risk of cross-infection,Completely free visiting by a parent increases his distress,He should not be told of his impending admission until the actual day,The possibility of injections or discomfort should not be mentioned,A,"A child of 4 being admitted to hospital for an operation will need a considerable amount of support and reassurance. He may not be able to express his fears and it is therefore important to prepare him in advance by taking him to visit the ward and allowing him to meet the staff. The hospital play leaders may be able to provide useful assistance by showing the child syringes and pumps and other hospital devices. They are also experienced in talking to children about the procedures in order to allay any potential fears. Most parents stay with their children however if this is not possible, free visiting will reduce the amount of separation anxiety and distress. Children should be encouraged to bring their favourite toy or blanket in order to create a familiar environment. Pre-school children are quite likely to display regressive behaviour on returning home and this is to be expected. This may manifest as temper tantrums, bed-wetting or challenging behaviour. It is important to ignore the behaviour and to reward and positively praise any good behaviour."
pediatrics,691,"An 18-month-old boy presents with fever and redness and swelling of the left eye, worsening over the past two days. He has previously been well. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination his temperature is 38.2°C, respiratory rate 25/min and heart rate100/min. Well perfused. His left eye is virtually closed by painful red swelling. There is yellow crusting of the lid margin. On soaking the eyelids open there is proptosis and painful movement of the eyes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cavernous sinus thrombosis,Grave's disease,Neuroblastoma,"Orbital cellulitis, postseptal","Orbital cellulitis, preseptal",D,"The picture is of sepsis of the left eye with involvement of the eyeball. This is true orbital cellulitis, rather than the commoner preseptal cellulitis. Both are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Group A strep, pneumococcus and H. influenzae. The latter is anterior to the fibrous septum running through the eyelid and does not involve the orbital structures. The former is much more serious as there may be proximal extension causing sinusitis or meningitis. Both require IV antibiotics, orbital cellulitis for 14 days and preseptal for 5 days IV + 5 days PO. H. influenzae is less common since Hib vaccination, and is regarded as a true vaccine failure if it occurs in an immunised child."
pediatrics,692,A child aged 10 days has ambiguous genitalia. Which of the following may be causative?,A raised urinary output of pregnanetriol would confirm a diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia,If a buccal smear is chromatin negative there is a serious risk of an Addisonian crisis,If testicles are present in the andquot;labiaandquot; an acceptable explanation would be Klinefelter's syndrome,The finding of the genotype 45 XO would reliably explain the anomaly,The most important factor in deciding the sex to which the child should be assigned is the genetic (chromosomal) sex,A,"If the buccal smear is positive (that is, female) then there would be an increased risk of salt crisis. Salt losers presenting in the newborn period with crisis are more likely to be female. However, as they have abnormal genitalia they are easily spotted. The rarer male salt-losers have the highest risk of death. The commonest cause of ambiguous genitalia at birth is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), of which 95% are deficient in 21-hydroxylase. For more information about urinary pregnanetriol. About two-thirds of 21-hydroxylase are salt losers, and present with an hypoadrenal crisis. There are normal male genitalia in 47 XXY (Klinefelter's) and XO (Turner's) XO. In intersex states, the assignation of sex is not totally based on the karyotype."
pediatrics,693,A 4-year-old girl attends a rheumatology clinic complaining of two months of pain and swelling affecting both her knees and her left elbow. A diagnosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis is made. What is the most important next step?,Autoimmune screen,Cervical spine x ray,Echo,Nail examination,Slit lamp examination,E,"Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a clinical diagnosis of arthritis that persists for a minimum of six consecutive weeks in one or more joints, commencing before the age of 16 years and after active exclusion of other causes. Classification is by mode of onset during the first six months. Slit lamp examination is the most important next step. Children with oligoarthritis and especially girls with an onset at less than 6 years of age are particularly at risk of chronic uveitis (or iridocyclitis). Untreated, this can cause blindness. The only way to prevent eye complications is by regular slit lamp examination. An autoimmune screen would be useful. Elevated ANA titres are found in 40-85% of children with pauciarticular or polyarticular arthritis but are unusual in children with systemic onset disease. Detectable ANA levels are associated with an increased risk of chronic uveitis. Again, the only safe way to prevent eye complications in oligoarthritis is by frequent monitoring by slit lamp examination. A cervical spine x ray could be used to look for atlanto-axial subluxation, however, MRI is the more commonly used imaging modality. This is usually associated with polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive disease. An echo would be useful to look for aortic incompetence. This is usually associated with polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive disease rather than oligoarthritis. A nail examination would be most relevant if a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis had been made. "
pediatrics,694,"A 1-year-old girl has had marked motor developmental delay since birth. Examination reveals that she has a large cranium, is hypotonic and has an intention tremor. What is the likely diagnosis?",Cerebral palsy,Craniostenosis,Dandy-Walker syndrome,Hereditary cerebellar degeneration,Neuroblastoma,C,"This young child has features of cerebellar ataxia with features of hydrocephalus from birth which suggest Dandy-Walker syndrome. The Dandy-Walker syndrome is a malformation of the brain that involves the maldevelopment of the cerebellum (hindbrain), associated with a cystic enlargement of this area, and frequently hydrocephalus. This malformation occurs in approximately one in 25,000 babies. It accounts for approximately 1 - 4% of cases of hydrocephalus and is seen more frequently in females than in males."
pediatrics,695,Which of the following is true of BCG vaccination?,Is a killed polysaccharide antigen vaccine,Is contraindicated in neonates,Is presently routinely offered in the UK at age 16 years,Provides protection against leprosy,Should be given to all children who have a strongly positive tuberculin test,D,"Whilst the BCG vaccine was developed against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, research has shown that it also has effects against leprosy (up to 80% protection). This is due to the fact that the organism which causes leprosy is also a Mycobacterium (M. leprae) and there are therefore some similarities between the two. The potential use of this in clinical practice is still being considered. The BCG vaccine may given to newborns at high risk of exposure. BCG previously was given at comprehensive school entry (age 11-13), however recent updates now recommend that it should be given to neonates in high risk groups. It has also found a use in stimulating the immune system for the treatment of some cancers, primarily bladder carcinoma. It should not be given to children who have a strongly positive tuberculin test. A Mantoux should be documented before administration. "
pediatrics,696,"A 10-year-old boy presents with difficulty kicking a ball and weakness over the lower legs which he has noted deteriorating over the last 12 months. On examination he has pes cavus deformity of both feet, weakness of the lower leg with loss of muscle bulk in the calves bilaterally but normal strength of the thigh muscles. Knee and ankle reflexes are lost but there is no sensory loss. What is the likely diagnosis?",Becker's muscular dystrophy,Chronic Guillain-Barré syndrome,Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease,Hereditary spastic diplegia,Werdnig-Hoffman disease,C,This young child has typical features of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy type II). This is an autosomal dominant condition associated with de-innervation and results in weakness of feet and ankle muscles with gradual ascension to involve mid-thigh. A sensory neuropathy may not be evident at first presentation but may develop.
pediatrics,697,A 15-year-old girl complained of anxiety and excessive sweating. She was not taking any medication. Investigations showed:    TSH concentration 0.9 mU/L (0.5-3.4)   Free T4 concentration 16 pmol/L (10-18)   Total T4 concentration 180 nmol/L (55-145)   Free T3 concentration 8.2 pmol/L (3.5-10.5)   Total T3 concentration 3.3 nmol/L (0.9-2.5)    These results are compatible with which one of the following diagnoses?,Factitious thyrotoxicosis,Familial dysalbuminaemic hyperthyroxinaemia,Pregnancy,Sick euthyroid syndrome,Thyrotoxicosis,C,"The symptom complex is intentionally misleading. The patient has a normal TSH and normal free T3 and T4 concentrations, excluding thyrotoxicosis but elevated total concentrations suggesting a rise in the binding globulins. This can occur in pregnancy. Sick euthyroidism would be typically associated with low thyroid hormone concentrations."
pediatrics,698,"A 15-month-old boy presents with fever. He has been off colour for three days, and has not been eating solids. His temperature has not settled with paracetamol. He had a full term normal delivery, and no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination, he is alert though miserable with a temperature of 38.2°C, respiratory rate 30/min, no recession and pulse 120/min, well perfused. ENT examination and abdominal examination are normal. Bag urine is negative to dipstix testing. Full blood count shows a white cell count of 13.1 ×10^9/L (45% lymphocytes, 35% neutrophils) and his C reactive protein is 25 mg/L (less than 5). What is the most likely diagnosis?",Kawasaki disease,Meningococcal septicaemia,Non-specific viral infection,Pneumococcal bacteraemia,Upper respiratory infection,C,"The fever and mild constitutional upset suggest a viral illness. It is important to exclude a urinary tract infection (UTI), as has been done in this case. In view of the age the full blood count (FBC) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are not unreasonable to do. Again, they suggest a viral illness as neither is greatly elevated."
pediatrics,699,"A 9-year-old girl presents with throat discomfort and cough, particularly during the daytime. She has been well over the winter, with symptoms worsening in the Spring. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she is apyrexial and well. She is constantly clearing her throat, and has a clear nasal discharge. She has no cervical lymphadenopathy. Her throat is minimally injected, and ear examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Foreign body,Infectious mononucleosis,Laryngeal carcinoma,Paratonsillar abscess,Postnasal drip,E,"The history is of nasal discharge and cough, worse since Spring. This points to allergens rather than infection as the underlying cause. A postnasal drip is the likely culprit for these symptoms. Treatment of the underlying problem with antihistamines and topical steroids is indicated. Laryngeal carcinoma would not be a likely or common diagnosis with this presentation in this age group."
pediatrics,700,You are reviewing the treatment of a 14-year-old girl with leukaemia and note that she is taking a small molecule kinase inhibitor. Which of the following correctly represents the function of kinases?,Transfer of carboxy groups,Transfer of hydroxyl groups,Transfer of methyl groups,Transfer of phosphate groups,Transfer of sulphonyl groups,D,"The answer is transfer of phosphate groups. The function of kinases is to transfer phosphate groups from high energy to low energy molecules. Activating mutations in kinase enzymes play a role in the development of a number of haematological malignancies including chronic myeloid leukaemia and lymphomas. Methylation and sulphonation are phase II reactions involved in hepatic drug metabolism. Hydroxylation is involved in a number of processes, including increasing activity of steroid hormones such as vitamin D. DNA methylation is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of disease, and is studied as epigenetics."
pediatrics,701,Which one of the following statements correctly applies to Pertussis Infection in children?,It is associated with an increase in the total lymphocyte count,It is infectious for at least 2 months after the termination of the coughing,It is invariably associated with an inspiratory whoop,It is usually diagnosed by growing the organism from a cough plate,It rarely affects infants under 6 months of age,A,"The disease is maximally infectious in the first 7-14 days of the illness, termed the catarrhal phase. There is an associated lymphocytosis. The organism is diagnosed by isolating the organism from nasal secretions. An inspiratory whoop may not be present, but complete apnoeic episodes can occur."
pediatrics,702,A 15-year-old girl is suspected of having infectious mononucleosis. Which of the following is NOT a recognised complication of this condition?,Encephalitis,Erythematous rash if exposed to flucloxacillin,Respiratory obstruction,Splenic rupture during convalescence,Thrombocytopenia,B,"Splenomegaly occurs in around 40% of cases and splenic rupture may occur. Respiratory obstruction may develop due to exudative pharngitis. Thrombocytopenia is frequently observed. The common presentations are with:  fever rash lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis.  Encephalitis is a rare sequela. The rash develops on exposure to ampicillin rather than to flucloxacillin."
pediatrics,703,A 16-month-old child is receiving regular Gaviscon infant for symptoms of reflux. The parents ask you about any adverse effects of therapy of which they need to be aware. Which of the following is associated with Gaviscon infant therapy?,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia,Hyponatraemia,C,"Gaviscon infant contains 0.92 mmol of sodium per dose, which is associated with an increased risk of hypernatraemia if the medicine is dosed to the maximum, particularly in infants with renal impairment. If hypernatraemia occurs, it is usually managed with oral fluid rehydration. The other electrolyte abnormalities listed are not seen with Gaviscon infant therapy."
pediatrics,704,"A nurse in the neonatal intensive care unit is calling you to see a preterm who is losing weight. He is a 7-day-old born at 27 weeks with a birth weight of 1000 g.

He was commenced on trophic feeding with expressed breast milk from the 2nd day of life, and achieved full feeds by the 5th day. His current weight is 890 g. He is tolerating feeds well (120 ml/kg/day) with normal bowl habits and urine output. What is the next step in the management plan?",Add fortifiers to the expressed breast milk,Add total parenteral nutrition support,Change milk to a specialised preterm formula milk,Increase feeds to 175 ml/kg/day,Keep monitoring the weight over the coming week,E,"In term babies, losing 10% of the birth weight in the first 7-10 days of life is normal. In preterms, especially extreme preterms, they might lost up to 15% of their weight. This preterm is expected to lose weight up to 150 g in the first 7-10 days, but he lost only 110 g which is reassuring. There is no need to add fortifiers to expressed breast milk at this stage, but hey might be added later. Breast milk should never be replaced by any formula milk. Increasing feeds to more than 150 ml/kg/day is not recommended as it may lead to gastric upset or feeding intolerance."
pediatrics,705,"In Winter, a 2-month-old boy presents with a two day history of coryza and difficulty in feeding. He develops cough and wheeze, and mother is concerned about his breathing pattern. He was born at 28 weeks gestation and required seven days of ventilation for surfactant deficient lung disease. Mother is a heavy smoker. On examination he has O2 saturations of 91% in air, with a heart rate of 150/minute and respiratory rate of 60/minute with moderate recession. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aspiration pneumonia,Bronchiolitis,Cystic fibrosis,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Virus-induced wheeze,B,"This is a classical picture of bronchiolitis. The causative organism is almost always respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). The likelihood of admission is increased with prematurity and maternal smoking. Other risk factors for severity are:  Congenital heart disease Immunodeficiency, and Gastro-oesophageal reflux."
pediatrics,706,"A 4-year-old boy presents with developmental delay, iris colobomata, a repaired ventricular septal defect, and characteristic appearance to his external ears. He has an MRI scan to investigate sensorineural deafness. This demonstrates bilateral Mondini defects. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alport syndrome,Branchio-oto-renal syndrome,CHARGE syndrome,Isolated sensorineural deafness,Pendred's syndrome,C,"CHARGE syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in CHD7. The acronym stands for:    C Iris coloboma   H Heart defect   A Atresia choanae   R Restriction of growth   G Genital anomalies   E Ear anomalies/deafness    A Mondini defect means that the cochlea has only 1.5 turns rather than 2.5; it is associated with sensorineural deafness and is a feature of CHARGE syndrome. Alport syndrome is x-linked and causes haematuria with deafness. There are no associated malformations. Banchio-oto-renal syndrome is not correct. Although it can cause a Mondini defect, the typical malformations are branchial clefts/sinuses and renal malformations. It is dominant due to EYA1 mutations. Isolated sensorineural deafness is incorrect because the history is clearly one of a multiple malformation syndrome. Pendred's syndrome is not correct; although it can be associated with Mondini defects, thyroid abnormalities are also present. Causes of a Mondini defect are:  CHARGE syndrome DiGeorge syndrome Pendred's syndrome, and Branchio-oto-renal syndrome.  "
pediatrics,707,"On skin examination of a patient you notice multiple, small, raised, slightly dome-shaped lesions containing purulent material. Which of the following is the best description of these lesions?",Bullae,Fissures,Pustules,Telangiectasia,Ulcers,C,"Pustules are small elevations of the skin containing cloudy or purulent material, usually consisting of necrotic inflammatory cells. Bullae are large vesicles containing serous fluid. Fissures are cracks in the skin that are narrow but deep. Telangiectasias are collections of enlarged capillaries visible on the skin or mucous membranes. Ulcers are seen as discontinuity of the skin with complete loss of the epidermis and often portions of the dermis and subcutaneous fat."
pediatrics,708,What is the best explanation for the muscle weakness seen in 8-10% of females who are heterozygotes for the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene?,A high proportion of the X chromosomes carrying the mutation are active in this female,Relaxation of imprinting,Variable expression of the disease gene,X inactivation does not affect the entire chromosome,X-linked recessive inheritance,A,A high proportion of the X chromosomes carrying the mutation being active is a good explanation for this.
pediatrics,709,A 7-year-old girl has been referred to the endocrine clinic as her mother is concerned that she is very tall and has breast tissue. Which of the following is the most common cause of precocious puberty associated with tall stature in girls?,Idiopathic,Intracranial tumour,McCune-Albright syndrome,Meningitis,Tuberous sclerosis,A,"True precocious puberty is commoner in girls and is usually idiopathic. It is uncommon in boys; more than half will have some form of intracranial pathology. In true precocious puberty the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics is due to premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Fifty per cent is due to idiopathic premature activation of HPG axis. Other causes include:  Central nervous system tumours Hydrocephalus Post-meningitis Hypothyroidism Neurofibromatosis Tuberous sclerosis, and McCune-Albright syndrome.  In boys, testes greater than4 ml (pubertal volume, due to gonadotrophin secretion from pituitary). Pseudo-precocious puberty is not due to premature activiation of the HPG axis; the source of sex hormones is adrenals/gonads. Other causes include:  Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Adrenal tumour.  In boys, testes less than4 ml (that is, increased adrenal not testicular androgens), in girls there is isolated pubic hair development. In examination of a child with early puberty the following are important considerations:  Measure height and growth velocity Accurate pubertal staging Palpate for goitre and determine thyroid status Look for skin pigmentation/depigmentation/other neurocutaneous syndromes CNS exam inc fundoscopy and visual fields Abdominal palpation.  Bone age (left wrist x ray):  Normal bone age - familial short stature, obesity Advanced bone age - hyperthyroidism, precocious puberty (increased androgens or oestrogens), Sotos syndrome Delayed bone age - GH deficiency, reduced androgens, increased cortisol, poor nutrition, constitutional growth delay, emotional deprivation, chronic disease, Turner syndrome."
pediatrics,710,A baby girl presents with bilateral flank masses and respiratory distress in the neonatal period. There is a history of oligohydramnios during pregnancy. She has low-set ears and a flattened nose. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Alport syndrome,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,Sporadic polycystic kidney disease,X linked polycystic kidney disease,C,"Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease occurs due to tubular dilatation of distal collecting ducts (not true cysts). Clinical presentation is usually either at antenatal ultrasound with large kidneys and oligohydramnios or in the neonatal period with bilateral flank masses and respiratory distress secondary to pulmonary hypoplasia. Potter facies and other components of oligohydramnios sequence, including low-set ears, micrognathia, flattened nose, limb positioning defects and growth deficiency may be present. Hypertension is usually noted during the first few weeks of life. Alport syndrome is a hereditary nephritis with sensorineural deafness and eye problems. Hypertension does not occur till mid teens. Renal problems usually present with microscopic haematuria. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease occurs due to true cysts arising from tubules. They get larger and more progressive with time. Clinical presentation is with microscopic haematuria, hypertension and renal failure in adults or late childhood. Cysts may be noted incidentally on abdominal ultrasound - the first cysts may not be noted until the patient is in their 20s. Sporadic and X linked polycystic kidney disease are not clinically recognised syndromes. "
pediatrics,711,"A 2-year-old boy presents with fever and knee pain for 18 hours. He has previously been well. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 38.9°C, with respiratory rate 24/min and pulse 100/min. He is alert and well perfused. His left knee is swollen, warm, red and exquisitely tender. It is held partly flexed. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Haemophilia A,Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,Osteomyelitis,Reactive arthritis,Septic arthritis,E,"The short history of fever, location and clinical findings all point to a septic arthritis. This can be confirmed by blood culture and needle aspiration of the joint. The common organisms are Staph. aureus and gram negative bacilli, with GBS in less than3/12 infants. Treatment is with intravenous antibiotics, with resolution followed by settling white cell count (WCC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP)."
pediatrics,712,Which one of the following statements correctly applies to normal growth?,Pubic hair growth is the first sign of puberty in boys,The average age of menarche is 12.0 years,The average growth velocity is 12 cm/year in the first year of life,The peak height velocity is 8 cm/year in girls during puberty,The upper to lower segment ratio is less than 1.0 during infancy,D,The average growth velocity is 18-25 cm per year in the first year of life. The height velocity peaks at between 6-11 cm/year in females but averages 8 cm. The height velocity peaks at 7-13 cm/year in males and occurs later in puberty. An upper to lower segment ratio of greater than 1.0 is normal in infancy. The first sign of puberty in males is 4 ml testicles. The average age of menarche is 12 years and 11 months.
pediatrics,713,"A 7-year-old boy presents with a limp and intermittent thigh pain of two months duration. He has previously been well. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination he is well and apyrexial. Respiratory rate is 15/min and pulse 80/min. He is on the 10% for height and the 25% for weight. He limps with minimal pain, but has limitation of abduction and internal rotation of the left hip. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Irritable hip,Legg-Calve-Perthe,Reactive arthritis,Septic arthritis,Slipped femoral epiphysis,B,"The history of 'painless limp' with reduction in hip movements suggests Legge-Calve-Perthes disease. This is an avascular necrosis of the femoral head in a growing child, especially pre-pubertal. There may be thigh muscle atrophy and slightly short stature. The disease is staged radiographically (several classifications available). Treatment is aimed at reducing femoral head deformity and later osteoporosis."
pediatrics,714,"A 4-year-old girl attends paediatric accident and emergency with difficulty in breathing, associated with three days of coryzal illness. She is irritable but distractible. On examination she has a temperature of 37.6°C, heart rate of 130 bpm, and a respiratory rate of 35. Her oxygen saturations are 95% on room air. You also note stridor at rest and an occasional barking cough, along with some subcostal recessions. She is well perfused. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",Alerting the on-call anaesthetist,Discharge on advice to return if the cough severity increases,Nebulised salbutamol,Oral steroids,"Thorough ENT examination, looking for obstruction",D,Oral dexamethasone is the key management of croup. With mild to moderate croup this treatment is often sufficient to stabilise the patient. Examination of the throat is not indicated in croup because of the risk of increasing agitation and worsening the airway obstruction. The patient should be kept as calm as possible. An anaesthetist should be alerted immediately when a possibility of complete airway obstruction is suspected. This scenario describes a moderate croup where there is no present risk of airway obstruction. Discharging a patient with any element of airway obstruction is negligent because the patient would need acute management. Salbutamol is not indicated unless there is wheeze or a strong history of asthma or atopy. 
pediatrics,715,At what age are children allowed to drink alcohol in public unaccompanied?,16 years,17 years,18 years,19 years,21 years,C,"United Kingdom legislation aims to reduce the exposure to alcohol and the effects of alcohol. In general, children below 18 years are not allowed to enter pubs unless accompanied by a responsible adult, and may not consume alcohol. In fact, many children younger than this consume alcohol, frequently to excess. The problem of binge drinking is rising both in boys and girls, and may be accompanied by other risk taking behaviour, such as drug taking and underage sex."
pediatrics,716,A 4-year-old boy presents to your clinic with a history of lower limb pain. He has also had a low-grade fever for two weeks associated with weight loss. On examination you notice he is pale with cervical lymphadenopathy. What is the next step in the management plan?,BCR/ABL molecular studies,Lymph node biopsy,Reassure the parents that this is a benign condition caused by an upper respiratory tract infection,Request a FBC and peripheral blood smear,Request a full septic screen,D,"This is a classic history of leukaemia which is more likely to be acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the most common type of leukaemia in this age group. It may present in various forms including bone pain, fever, headache, focal neurological signs, bleeding and recurrent infections. A FBC and peripheral blood smear are the first tests that should be requested if leukaemia is suspected. They will help to determine whether the leukaemia is lymphoblastic or myeloblastic, and detect other abnormalities such as thrombocytopenia. BCR/ABL molecular studies are only beneficial in identifying the Philadelphia chromosome, which is certainly not a priority at this stage. Bone morrow rather than lymph node biopsy may be considered at a later stage in the management plan. Reassuring parents that it is likely to be a viral illness or reactive arthritis is inappropriate because of the associated weight loss. Full septic screen can be considered later according to FBC results and the patient's condition. "
pediatrics,717,"A 4-year-old girl presents with extensive bruising over the trunk, legs and palate. She had an URTI four weeks ago, but has otherwise been well. 39+5/40 3.8 kg delivery, with no neonatal problems. No FH of note. On examination she is well. Temperature is 36.7°C (tympanic), HR 90/min, RR 20/min. Extensive fresh bruising of irregular shape over trunk, thighs and shins. Old bruises over shin. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Child physical abuse,Henoch-Schölein purpura,Idiopathic Thrombocytopaenic Purpura,Meningococcal septicaemia,D,"This girl had a presumed viral illness a month ago and now presents with sudden onset of extensive bruising. The likely diagnosis is idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. This can be confirmed by a full blood count and film, which shows isolated thrombocytopenia, often less than10 ×10^12/L. Most can be managed conservatively, with the platelet count recovering spontaneously over one to four weeks. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or steroids may accelerate recovery. If steroid therapy is contemplated, consideration should be given to performing a bone marrow biopsy to exclude a thrombocytopenic presentation of leukaemia."
pediatrics,718,"A 15-year-old boy lands awkwardly following a physical challenge in football, causing flexion to his neck. He is not knocked out, but complains of neck pain. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.7°C, RR 12/min and HR 65/min. He complains of posterior midline lower cervical pain and tenderness. What is the most important element of management?",Cervical spine CT scan,Cervical spine MRI,Cervical spine stabilisation,Cervical spine x Ray,Secondary survey,C,"The history of forced flexion injury and neck pain suggest that cervical injury +/- fracture should be positively excluded. The patient should not be moved until the cervical spine is stabilised, initially by hand, then by hard collar, blocks and spinal board. He should have AP, lateral, oblique and open mouth (Town's views). If doubt remains a CT or MRI of the spine is indicated. Cervical spine protection should remain until significant spinal injury has been excluded. "
pediatrics,719,"A 3-year-old boy presents with a two week history of pallor and lethargy. Today mother has noticed that he has a low grade fever and some spots on his chest. He was born at 36/40 gestation weighing 2.6 kg. He was diagnosed with Down's syndrome in the neonatal period. He has had glue ear requiring grommet insertion. On examination he has a temperature of 37.8°C (tympanic), RR of 15/min and HR of 100/min. He looks pale and lethargic. He has petechiae and ecchymoses over his chest. He has 3 cm of liver edge palpable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukaemia,Aplastic anaemia,Dietary iron deficiency,Occult blood loss,Sickle cell disease,A,"The history suggests a rapid progression of bone marrow failure, with features of abnormalities in all three cell lines: red cells, white cells and platelets. The most likely cause is acute leukaemia. The incidence is 20-30 times increased in children with Down's syndrome. The diagnosis is confirmed by bone marrow biopsy. Treatment will be guided by the precise cell types involved."
pediatrics,720,An 8-month-old child has been passing frequent watery stools for 5 days. His serum biochemistry revealed the following:    Na 158 mmol/L (137-144)   K 3.5 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 13 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 120 µmol/L (60-110)   pH 7.08 (7.36-7.44)   PCO2 4.5 KPa (4.7-6.0)   PO2 13 kPa (11.3-12.6)   Base excess −18 mmol/L (+/-2)    Which one of the following statements correctly applies to this case scenario?,A rapid infusion of sodium bicarbonate should be given to correct the acidosis,Replacement fluid to correct dehydration should be given over 6 hours to replenish the intravascular volume,Skin turgor is a good guide in assessing hydration state,The condition might have resulted from taking concentrated feed before the onset of diarrhoea,The high serum sodium might have resulted from his being given only plain congee for the past 3 days at home,D,"The hypernatraemic dehydration will be a result of disproportionate loss of water and low volume fluid intake. Congee (rice water) is an effective rehydration solution and prevents further diarrhoea. The acidosis is likely to be due to poor tissue perfusion and should be corrected by intravascular volume expansion. Skin turgor should be used to assess hydration status in combination with other signs. In hypernatraemia this will be relatively preserved, and may be 'doughy' in consistency. Concentrated high sodium feeds and high sodium breast milk have been reported to cause hypernatraemic dehydration. If there is evidence of hypotension and shock a bolus of 20 ml/kg should be given for resuscitation. Correction of electrolyte deficits should be over 48-72 hours."
pediatrics,721,"An 8-year-old boy develops a seizure affecting his right arm, seizure lasts for several minutes. He doesn’t remember anything what happened. On his CT: lesion in left hemisphere.

pediatrics,722,"A 3-month-old infant is referred to the paediatric ward with a history of poor weight gain. He was born at term by normal delivery to a 16-year-old primigravida mother living in a homeless shelter. His mother was previously a heroin addict however she is currently on a methadone programme. Following delivery he was observed for five days on the postnatal ward due to concerns of neonatal abstinence syndrome, he did not require any treatment for this. His birth weight was 3 kg and he currently weighs 4 kg. His mother states he feeds well and is taking approximately 100 ml four hourly of Cow and Gate. He tolerates his feeds well and sleeps contentedly afterwards. He opens his bowels regularly and his mother describes normal stool. The health visitor is concerned as the hostel reports the baby often cries for prolonged periods during the night and can be unsettled during the day often desperately sucking on his fist. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?",Cow's milk protein intolerance,Cystic fibrosis,Gastro-oesophageal reflux,Human immunodeficiency virus infection,Non-organic failure to thrive,E,"Failure to thrive is defined as a significant interruption in the expected rate of growth during early childhood. Anthropometric definitions of failure to thrive vary however one generally accepted principle is a fall across two or more percentile lines on standard growth charts. Whilst weight drops initially after birth by up to 10% birth weight should be regained by 10-14 days. On average infants gain 1 kg per month in the first three months and 0.5 kg per month from age 3 to 6 months. Failure to thrive can be:  Organic (a specific disease process resulting in failure to gain weight appropriately) Non-organic (due to psychosocial issues), or Both organic and non-organic combined.  Organic failure to thrive may be caused by insufficient calories due to feeding problems such as in cerebral palsy, increase caloric needs such as in cystic fibrosis or failure to retain calories due to absorptive defects or vomiting or diarrhoea. Failure to thrive may be the first presenting feature of HIV infection in infants and could be a valid differential diagnosis in the above case however the multiple social problems point more toward non-organic failure to thrive, particularly with the contradictory history from the hostel staff."
pediatrics,723,"A 6-year-old girl with constipation, re-presented with abdominal pain having not opened her bowels for nine days. She is unkempt. Her abdomen was soft with faeces palpable on the right side. This was the fourth admission over the past three months with constipation. She had been treated previously with large doses of Movicol until regular bowel actions and discharged home on regular medication. Since her discharge, the GP has been alerted to concerns from school that she has had poor attendance and her uniform is often dirty. The family failed to attend their outpatient follow up. What is the best next step in management of this case?",Copy the discharge letter to the health visitor,Discharge home with rapid follow-up in OPD,Refer to police as a child in need,Refer to police for emergency protection,Refer to social services,E,This girl is showing longstanding signs of neglect and needs social services input.
pediatrics,724,"A 12-year-old boy presents with a seven day history of fever, headache, myalgia and malaise. After three days he developed a pink rash and tender glands in the neck.

He has no murmur and is well perfused. He has 2 cm hepatomegaly and 4 cm splenomegaly. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute leukaemia,CMV infection,HIV infection,EBV infection,Toxoplasmosis,D,"The history is suggestive of a systemic infection with fever, rash, lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. The picture is of a mononucleosis-like illness. This can be caused by EBV, CMV and toxoplasmosis. Treatment is symptomatic. Of these, EBV is the most common that is symptomatic. "
pediatrics,725,"A 15-year-old boy presents with a three day history of a generalised painful rash associated with erosions in his mouth and genitals. He was recently started on carbamazepine for seizures. He is febrile and appears ill. On examination, there are dusky, targetoid papules and plaques on his face, trunk and limbs. Firm pressure on the dusky areas leads to desquamation of the superficial skin. What sign is being demonstrated?",Auspitz's sign,Darier's sign,Dermatographism,Koebner phenomenon,Nikolsky's sign,E,"This patient has toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN), a severe idiosyncratic drug reaction, with a high morbidity and mortality rate. Commonly implicated drugs include anti-epileptics, penicillins, NSAIDS and allopurinol. Patients present with erythematous-to-dusky plaques and targetoid lesions that progress rapidly to painful, full-thickness, epidermal desquamation involving more than 30% of body surface area. Mucosal involvement is also seen. Nikolsky's sign is elicited when rubbing of the skin results in exfoliation of the outermost layer and is classically seen in patients with TEN. Auspitz's sign is seen when psoriatic scales are scraped off leaving punctuate bleeding points. Darier's sign is seen in patients with mastocytosis or urticaria pigmentosa, whereby rubbing of the lesions leads to urticarial-like wheals. Dermatographism is a form of urticaria whereby rubbing of the skin leads to development of wheals. Koebner's phenomenon is the appearance of skin lesions in areas subjected to trauma. It is classically seen in psoriasis but may also be seen in other dermatoses, for example, lichen planus, vitiligo, Darier's disease."
pediatrics,726,"A 6-month-old baby presents with a one day history of fever (39°C), and a generalised rash, which began on the legs and is now present on limbs and trunk virtually equally, which is purplish, non-palpable, and non-blanching.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Giant urticaria,Haemophilia,Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Measles in mild form,Meningococcal septicaemia,E,"Meningococcal septicaemia causes a generalised non-blanching purpuric eruption - this is probably the best answer from the list provided. Giant urticaria is characterised by recurring attacks of transient oedema suddenly appearing in areas of the skin or mucous membranes and occasionally of the viscera, often associated with dermatographism, erythema, and purpura. The measles rash starts about 14 days after exposure and appears as a generalised macular eruption on face, neck and spreads over three days. Haemophilia is not associated with generalised rash. HSP would not typically present with a high fever in an acutely unwell child. It is more likely to present in a sub-acute manner, which may be following an upper respiratory tract infection."
pediatrics,727,A term baby born to a 30 year old woman of blood group A-ve develops severe jaundice within the first 24 hours of birth. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hereditary spherocytosis,G6PD,ABO incompatibility,Rh incompatibility,Physiological jaundice,D,Rh incompatibility is a condition that occurs during pregnancy if a woman has Rh-negative blood and her baby has Rh-positive blood
pediatrics,728,"A 10-year-old boy is referred with heart murmur. He has collapsed on one occasion after energetic sport, but recovered quickly and has otherwise been well. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he is well and on the 75% for height and weight. Respiratory rate is 15/min and pulse 85/min and blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg. Pulse volume is low, but equal in all four limbs. He has a carotid thrill, an ejection click and 3/6 ejection systolic murmur best heard at the upper sternum and conducted into the neck. No liver is palpable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic coarctation,Aortic stenosis,Congenital heart block,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,Simple faint,B,"The history of collapse, plateau pulses and characteristic murmur all point to aortic stenosis as the diagnosis. This requires detailed assessment with echocardiography, ECG and chest x ray. It may be amenable to balloon valvuloplasty, which may help delay the need for surgery until he is fully grown. Valve replacement is usually required in symptomatic cases. A patient with aortic stenosis is considered to be at risk of infective endocarditis, although antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer routinely offered for dental procedures. In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients half are asymptomatic (picked up on screening because of family history). Others may present with chest pain, palpitations or syncope. The pulses may be hyperdynamic or reduced with a hyperdynamic praecordium. There may be an ejection murmur in the aortic area but there is no ejection click. There may also be an apical murmur of mitral regurgitation. "
pediatrics,729,"A 9-year-old girl presents with fever, sore throat and difficulty in swallowing. She was well until five days ago, when she developed a sore throat. This has gradually progressed, with worsening difficulty in swallowing, neck tenderness and elevation in fever. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she has a temperature to 38.9°C. She hyperextends her neck and has gurgling breathing with marked reluctance to swallow. She has tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Throat inspection reveals a bulge in the left posterior pharyngeal wall. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Adenovirus infection,Epiglottitis,Group A streptococcal infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Retropharyngeal abscess,E,"The history of initial pharyngitis with worsening sore throat and bulging posterior pharyngeal wall suggest a posterior pharyngeal abscess. Analgesia and flucloxacillin may be curative, but surgery is often required."
pediatrics,730,"A 15-year-old boy presents with acute left testicular pain. He is not sexually active. On examination the scrotum appears normal but he has a tender, swollen left testis. The right testis appears normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute epididymitis,Mumps orchitis,Ruptured epididymal cyst,Testicular neoplasm,Testicular torsion,E,"The features of acute testicular pain suggest testicular torsion and should prompt surgical referral. This is a clinical diagnosis. There may only be a few hours before irreversible ischaemia occurs. Investigations, such as ultrasound, may be unhelpful, unavailable or cause delay. When in doubt explore (and fix the other side too if it is a torsion). It is better to explore and be wrong than the other way round. Torsion: acute pain and swelling of testis, with absent cremasteric reflex. Epididimitis: acute pain and swelling. Rare before puberty, and commoner in sexually active."
pediatrics,731,"An 18-month-old boy presents with pain in the right elbow. He was protesting about coming shopping with father, who pulled him up by his arm. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.5°C, respiratory rate 20/min, pulse 100/min. His right hand is held pronated, and he cries when detailed examination is attempted. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Erb’s palsy,Osteoid osteoma,Osteomyelitis,Pulled elbow,Shoulder dislocation,D,"The patient has sudden onset of elbow pain following a traction injury. The history suggests a pulled elbow (nursemaid's elbow), where the annular ligament around the proximal radius is subluxed into the elbow joint. Rotating the hand to the supinated position whilst pressing on the radial head reduces the dislocation with a palpable click and instant relief of symptoms."
pediatrics,732,Which of the following is a child with recurrent upper urinary tract infections most likely to show?,Neurogenic bladder,Horseshoe kidney,Renal and ureteric calculi,Vesicoureteric reflux,null,D,"Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) is characterised by the retrograde flow of urine from the bladder to the kidneys. Untreated vesicoureteral reflux may increase the risk of developing pyelonephritis, hypertension, and progressive renal failure. In children this condition is usually caused by a congenital abnormality and is considered to be primary VUR. Horseshoe kidney does predispose to UTIs but is much more rare than VUR."
pediatrics,733,"A 3-year-old child presents with bruising to the emergency department. His mother says that this appeared yesterday. He was born at 32+2 weeks gestation weighing 1.54 kg. He required ventilation for surfactant deficient lung disease, then home oxygen for chronic lung disease. He was operated on for necrotising enterocolitis. Subsequently he was admitted with failure to thrive and his mother was treated for postnatal depression. He is one of three children, all under five years. Both parents are unemployed. On examination he looks weepy and suspicious. He is on the second centile for height and the 0.4th centile for weight. He has Harrison's sulcus. Temperature is 36.5°C, respiratory rate 20/min and heart rate 95/min. Chest is clear and there is no murmur. He has three purple linear bruises over his back and thighs 5, 5.5 and 7 cm long. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Child physical abuse,Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Meningococcal septicaemia,B,"This is a vulnerable child with fresh bruising and an inconsistent history. The pattern of bruising suggests the use of a strap or belt. The diagnosis is child physical abuse until proven otherwise. It is important to familiarise yourself with the local procedures for managing such cases. Involve your seniors.

Clotting should be checked and consideration given to doing a skeletal survey."
pediatrics,734,"A 17-month-old boy has been completely well and playing with his toys. Mother hears him coughing and choking and rushes next door. She finds him gagging and retching, drooling and red in the face. He was born at 37+3/40 weighing 3.7 kg and there were no neonatal problems. On examination his temperature is 36.9°C, respiratory rate 30/min, heart rate 130/min. He looks slightly cyanosed with an O2 saturation of 85% in air. He has marked stridor and moderate recession. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylaxis,Croup,Foreign body aspiration,Peritonsillar abscess,Retropharyngeal abscess,C,"The history suggests aspiration of a foreign body. Small objects, such as toys, are the commonest offenders. They can give rise to acute obstruction, or there may be a latent period when symptoms settle before inflammation around the object gives rise to symptoms. Assessment requires a chest x ray, which will locate radioopaque objects, and bronchoscopy to remove the object."
pediatrics,735,Which one of the following statements is true regarding Giardia lamblia?,May be cause of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS),May be excluded by stool microscopy,May be treated with co-trimoxazole (Septrin),May cause intestinal malabsorption,Often causes a bloody diarrhoea,D,"Giardia lamblia is a common cause of traveller's diarrhoea, along with E. coli. It is also a common cause of intestinal malabsorption. It is treated with metronidazole. Stool microscopy to detect cysts and oocysts is labour intensive and lacks the sensitivity of the current test of choice, the detection of antigens on the surface of the organisms in the stool specimen. A single stool examination will identify about 50% of cases, and three stool samples about 90%. Blood loss is not a feature of this condition. HUS may be caused by E. coli 0157 infection, but not giardiasis."
pediatrics,736,"A 12-year-old girl presents with a leg length discrepancy. She complains that it causes her to limp and she is very self-conscious about the problem. She does not have any back pain or scoliosis. From her history you gather that she first noticed the problem about six months ago and she began menstruating eight months ago. On examination her leg alignment is normal, as are her joint range of motions and she does not have a pelvic tilt. When her knees and hips are flexed to 90° you see that her femurs are the same length, but her right tibia seems to be slightly longer than the left. Using blocks under the shorter leg you predict that the discrepancy is 2 cm, which is confirmed on a full-length leg radiograph. What would be the most appropriate management course?",A corticotomy and distraction with fixator to lengthen the shorter leg,"An epiphysiodesis of the right proximal tibia, in order to ablate the physis and prevent further growth",Discharge the patient,Provide a shoe raise or insert and discharge her,Provide a shoe raise or insert and review in six months,E,"A limb length discrepancy of up to 1.5 cm can be managed by observation and shoe raises or inserts. Although surgery can be considered for a discrepancy of 2 cm and more, shoe raises can still be used up to a difference of 5 cm. In this case a shoe raise should help her to feel less self-conscious about the LLD and reviewing her in six months allows it to be measured again. The surgical options risk over-correcting the difference and as LLDs are common in teenage girls it would be better to watch and wait to see if it naturally resolves or gets worse. However, it is important to see her again within a year because she has already begun puberty and if the discrepancy gets worse she will need surgical intervention before her physes close. A corticotomy and distraction with fixator to lengthen the shorter leg would be a drastic surgical intervention for such a small discrepancy. Without checking her predicted final height, physeal ablation would risk over-correcting the discrepancy. "

pediatrics,738,A 14-year-old boy presents with a seven month history of intermittent cramping abdominal pain which has worsened over the last two weeks. On examination he is pale and has a tender mass in the right iliac fossa (RIF). Which of the options below is the most likely diagnosis?,Appendicitis,Constipation,Crohn's disease,Intussusception,Lymphoma,C,"Crohn's disease is an idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the intestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. It is a full-thickness inflammation and can lead to stricturing, perforation and fistulation. Crohn's disease is the most likely diagnosis given the length of history and the fact that he appears anaemic on examination. Crohn's disease can cause anaemia of chronic disease, often combined with iron deficiency anaemia due to blood loss into the intestine. Chronic transmural inflammation of the terminal ileum can lead to the formation of an inflammatory mass in the RIF. Appendicitis is less likely given the length of history and is not usually associated with anaemia although it can present with a RIF mass, especially if misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection (UTI) and partially treated with antibiotics. Constipation would give a left sided mass and not cause anaemia. Intussusception is unlikely in this age group but can be seen associated with a pathological lead point, the history would be more acute however. Lymphoma may present with a mass and anaemia but this is far less likely than Crohn's and does not usually cause pain."
pediatrics,739,A 3-year-old boy visits his GP. Which of the following clinical features would lower the probability of asthma?,Cough worse when laughing or upset,Eczema as a baby,Moist cough,Wheeze worse early in the morning,Widespread wheeze heard throughout the chest,C,"There are many different causes of wheeze and different clinical patterns of wheezing can be recognised. The commonest clinical pattern of asthma, especially in preschool children and infants, is episodes of wheezing, cough and difficulty breathing associated with viral upper respiratory infections (colds), with no persisting symptoms. According to the BTS guidelines, more than one of the following clinical features increase the probability of asthma:  Wheeze Cough Difficulty breathing, and Chest tightness.  This is particularly the case if these symptoms:  Are frequent and recurrent Are worse at night and in the early morning Occur in response to, or are worse after, exercise or other triggers, such as exposure to pets, cold or damp air, or with emotions or laughter, and Occur apart from colds.  A moist cough decreases the probability of asthma as it is more likely a result of infection or other cause, such as bronchiectasis. Clinical features that lower the probability of asthma:  Symptoms with colds only, with no interval symptoms Isolated cough in the absence of wheeze or difficulty breathing History of moist cough Prominent dizziness, light-headedness, peripheral tingling Repeatedly normal physical examination of chest when symptomatic Normal peak expiratory flow (PEF) or spirometry when symptomatic No response to a trial of asthma therapy Clinical features pointing to alternative diagnosis.

pediatrics,740,By what gestation date can the 'D' antigen be found on the erythrocytes of Rh-positive fetuses?,6^th week of gestation,10^th week of gestation,14^th week of gestation,18^th week of gestation,20^th week of gestation,A,"The 'D' antigen can be found on the erythrocytes of Rh-positive fetuses by the sixth week of gestation. As feto-maternal transfusions occur in the majority of pregnancies, from the sixth week of pregnancy, blood containing Rhesus antigens may be infused into the maternal circulation and cause sensitisation in Rh negative women. In case of miscarriage, abortion, ectopic pregnancy and cystic mole, the chance of feto-maternal transfusion followed by sensitisation of the mother is significantly increased. Therefore, in such cases, immunoprophylaxis with anti-D-immunoglobins should be performed in all Rhesus negative women. Rh haemolytic disease is the prototype of maternal alloimmunisation and fetal haemolytic disease although there are other antigens capable of causing alloimmunisation and haemolytic disease such as 'C', Kell, and Fya. Rh immunisation is usually caused by a prior Rh positive fetal maternal transplacental haemorrhage, which occurs in at least 75% of pregnancies."
pediatrics,741,Which one of the following statements correctly applies to immunisation of children in the United kingdom?,BCG vaccinaton should not be performed in the neonatal period,HIV positive children should receive the measles/mumps/rubella and IM polio vaccines,Immunity to polio after the three initial SC/IM doses is lifelong,Polio vaccine is given by intradermal injection,"The first Diptheria, pertussis and tetanus inoculation should be given at one year",B,"National guidelines state that the first diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus inoculation should be given at eight weeks with IM polio, Hib and meningococcal C. BCG can be administered at birth to high risk neonates soon after birth. The guidelines recommend that school leavers are administered IM polio vaccine, diphtheria and tetanus as the initial injections may not confer lifelong immunity. Polio vaccine can be given as an oral preparation which contains the live virus or as a subcutaneous injection of the inactivated virus. HIV positive children should receive MMR and all the appropriate killed vaccines as well as pneumococcal vaccination. If CD4 count is extremely low, then vaccinations can be deferred until HAART therapy has boosted their immunity. BCG and live oral polio vaccines are contraindicated.   "
pediatrics,742,"A 5-year-old boy presents with fever, rash and hepatomegaly. He was well until 7 days before, when he developed malaise, headache and fever. Subsequently a maculopapular rash had appeared over the trunk. An enlarged liver was noted by the family doctor. He had a full-term, normal delivery, and no neonatal problems.

This suspicion is supported by the atypical lymphocytes and elevated liver enzymes, which suggest a mild hepatitis is present.Usually enzyme elevation is more dramatic in Hepatitis A. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and toxoplasmosis can cause this picture, the latter two of which may cause teratogenicity in pregnant mothers. EBV is the most common of these. "
pediatrics,743,A 15-year-old boy presented with wheezing when playing football and nocturnal cough. Which is the best test to confirm the underlying condition?,A trial of inhaled corticosteroids,A trial of inhaled salbutamol,A trial of oral corticosteroids,Serial peak expiratory flow rate measurements,Spirometry alone,B,"Current clinical guidelines recommended focusing the initial assessment of children suspected of having asthma on the presence of key features in the history and clinical examination, with careful consideration of alternative diagnoses. Structured questionnaires are felt to provide a standardised approach on which to base a diagnosis of asthma. In those children thought to have a high probability of asthma, it is recommended that clinicians move straight to a trial of treatment, and reserve further testing for those with a poor response. In children with a low probability of asthma, more detailed investigation and specialised referral is indicated. Where there is an intermediate probability of asthma, spirometry or a trial of treatment can be considered. "

pediatrics,747,"A newborn baby is found to be extremely hypotonic at birth. He also has small ears, upslanting palpebral fissures, brachycephaly and Brushfield spots. A diagnosis of Down's syndrome (trisomy 21) is confirmed on testing. Which one of the genetic mechanisms below is the most likely to have caused trisomy 21 in this baby?",Maternal robertsonian translocation 14:21,Maternal robertsonian translocation 21:21,Meiotic non-disjunction,Mosaicism,Paternal robertsonian translocation 14:21,C,"This question is about which genetic mechanism is most common, not about recurrence risks.  95% of trisomy 21 is caused by meiotic non-disjunction 2% robertsonian translocations 2% mosaicism 1% various chromosomal rearrangements.  Only 2% Down's syndrome is caused by robertsonian translocation. Translocation of 14:21 is the most common in these familial translocations in around 50%.  If a child with Down's syndrome has a de novo robertsonian translocation, that is, if parental karyotypes are normal, the recurrence risk for Down's syndrome in future offspring is less than 2%. If the father has a translocation involving chromosome 21, for example, 14:21, the recurrence risk is 1%. If the mother has a translocation of 14:21, recurrence risk is 10-15%. If either parent carries a 21:21 translocation, the recurrence risk is on the order of 100%. Only 2% of Down's syndrome is caused by mosaicism. After a couple have had two trisomy 21 pregnancies, mosaicism would be considered a strong possibility and the recurrence risk for future pregnancies would be greater than 10%. 95% of all trisomy 21 pregnancies are caused by meiotic non-disjunction and recurrence risk is affected by increasing maternal age."
pediatrics,748,"A 15-year-old female comes to you requesting a termination of pregnancy. She tells you that her boyfriend is 17-years-old. Having asked a number of questions about the relationship you do not have reason to suspect that it is abusive. The patient seems to be mature for her age, understands what you are telling her about her options and appears capable of deciding for herself what she wants to do. You cannot persuade her to inform her parents that she is pregnant. The girls mother makes an appointment the following day and tells you that she knows her daughter has been to see you. She says that she is worried about her daughter, and asks you to tell her whether you have given her daughter any family planning advice.

Their lordships held that in certain circumstances a child under 16 can give valid consent without parental knowledge or agreement. There is no duty to report a crime. However, if you feel that disclosure is necessary to protect a patient from risk of serious harm, for example if you suspect that she has been abused, you should take action. It would be helpful to discuss matters with a suitably experienced colleague, for example your child protection lead. It would also be advisable to discuss difficult cases with your medical defence organisation.

pediatrics,749,Which of the following is true regarding laryngotracheobronchitis?,Approximately 60% of children with laryngotracheobronchitis need to be hospitalised,"Endoscopy is recommended in those with symptoms of laryngotracheobronchitis aged less than 18 months to exclude anatomical abnormality, gastro-oesophageal reflux or laryngeal haemangioma",Influenza A is the most common cause of laryngotracheobronchitis,Laryngotracheobronchitis has a peak incidence between the ages of 4 and 5 years,Laryngotracheobronchitis is the most common cause of infectious airway obstruction in children,E,"Laryngotracheobronchitis (croup) is usually a viral illness, associated with fever, hoarseness of voice followed by paroxysms of nonproductive, seal-like cough that ends with a characteristic inspiratory stridor. The child appears anxious and has tachypnoea, inspiratory stridor, retraction of intercostal muscles, and associated rhonchi or wheezing. Hospitalisation rates vary from 1-30%; most cases of laryngotracheobronchitis are self-limiting. Endoscopy is recommended in those with symptoms of laryngotracheobronchitis aged less than 6 months to exclude anatomical abnormality, gastro-oesophageal reflux or laryngeal haemangioma. Parainfluenza type 1 is the most common cause of laryngotracheobronchitis and types 1 or 2 account for 75% of cases. Laryngotracheobronchitis is most common between the ages of 6 months to 6 years, but peak incidence is in children 1-2 years of age."

Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenza and gram-negative organisms can also infect bone. New subperiosteal bone formation is the involucrum. The dead bone within the medullary canal is the sequestrum. In children the infection is usually acquired by haematogenous spread to the metaphysis of long bones."
pediatrics,751,You are reviewing a 2-week-old term boy at your clinic. He was admitted in the neonatal unit as a case of meconium aspiration syndrome. He needed mechanical ventilation immediately after birth for three days then placed on nasal CPAP for two days and discharged at 10 days of life. The child is currently healthy. You note that routine screening for hypothyroidism and phenylketonuria performed in the 3rd day of life are negative.  What is the most appropriate next step in the management plan?,Family education about detecting hypothyroidism,Reassurance,Repeat neonatal TSH and phenylketonuria screening now,Repeat neonatal TSH screening after 2 weeks of discharge,Repeat neonatal TSH screening now,E,"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) in the UK has an incidence of 1:4000; twice as common in females. It is usually done by measuring serum TSH after 24 hours of birth (need to avoid initial TSH surge) and within seven days. There are causes of false-negative and false-positive results of CH screening. Critical illness is one cause of false-negative results. This fact is often overlooked as the screening test is done routinely in the neonatal units. Therefore, it is recommended to repeat screening in critically ill patients when the patient is well before discharge. Screening for phenylketonuria will not be affected in critical illness. "
pediatrics,752,An otherwise healthy 7-year-old boy presents with an asymptomatic 1 × 1 cm firm oval swelling in the left submandibular region. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute follicular tonsillitis,Branchial cyst,Chronic lymphadenitis,Salivary duct calculus,Thyroglossal cyst,C,"Cervical lymphadenopathy is very common in children. This is usually related to a previous mild upper respiratory viral infection. Most enlarged glands will resolve with time. Diseases of the lymph nodes include acute lymphadenitis (inflammation arising from an acute infection) and chronic lymphadenitis, frequently associated with hyperplasia of the node. Nodes may be enlarged secondary to malignant infiltration. This is rare in children. Tuberculosis must always be considered. In this case, as the child is well, it is unlikely that a follicular tonsillitis is the cause. The lymphadenopathy related to glandular fever may last for some months after the acute illness. A thorough history and examination needs to be undertaken with particular reference to more extensive lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly and possible mediastinal masses. First line investigations would include blood tests to exclude blood dyscrasias, as well as blood tests for inflammatory markers, for example:  erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) C- reactiveprotein (CRP) antistreptolysin-O test (ASOT) titres, and Paul Bunnell test (glandular fever).  If clinically there are signs of bacterial infection then the treatment of choice would be a course of antibiotics. Salivary gland calculi are rare in childhood and a thyroglossal cyst should be in the midline. A brachial cyst may present at this age but is fluid filled and usually anterior to sternomastoid rather than submandibular. "

pediatrics,754,"An 8-year-old boy is brought to the Emergency department by his grandmother after he was stung by a honeybee on his forearm an hour ago. The child complains of local pain and itchiness. He also complained of andquot;tightnessandquot; in his neck and mild difficulty in breathing after the insect bite, but this tightness resolved spontaneously on his way to the hospital. On examination the child is stable and sitting still in the examination bed. There is an erythema 10 cm around the insect bite, which is warm. Other clinical exams are normal including the chest. A cold compress is already applied on the site. What is the next step in the management plan?",Admit the patient to the ward for 24 hours,Give an anti-venom for honeybees,Observe for 4 hours then discharge and prescribe an EpiPen,Observe for 4 hours then discharge and refer to an allergy specialist for desensitisation,Rapid sequence induction and intubation,C,"There are no clear epidemiological statistics on insect bites and stings. Generally they are more common in warmer climates. Nevertheless, good understanding of pathophysiology is essential as insect bites can be life-threatening and unpredictable. In this case the patient can be discharged as his symptoms were self-limiting. However, a prescription and proper instruction on how to use an EpiPen are essential as a second exposure to a bee sting may lead to rapid mast cell activation leading to a life-threatening event. There is no need to admit the patient for 24 hours even in more severe reactions. This is because IgE mediated reactions rarely last beyond 2 hours. However, if adrenaline is given it is recommended to keep the patient under observation for 4 hours as its effects start to wear off after 4 hours. There is no anti-venom for honeybees available for daily medical practice. Desensitisation treatment is not justified for bee stings because exposure to bees can usually be avoided. While it is true that prophylactic intubation is much superior to rescue cricothyrotomy, there is no evidence that this patient may develop severe airway obstruction. "
pediatrics,755,A 9-year-old girl presents with left loin pain and a fever. Her urine grows Escherichia coli. She rapidly improves with a course of oral antibiotics. What is the most appropriate management course?,DMSA scan in four months,No further treatment or investigation,Prophylactic antibiotics,Refer to a urologist,Urgent ultrasound scan,B,"This child has an upper urinary tract infection (UTI) caused by a typical organism that responded promptly to appropriate treatment. A single UTI in a child over 3-years-old warrants no further investigation or treatment according to NICE guidelines. A DMSA scan is recommended in the guidelines only after recurrent UTI for this age child, two or more upper tract infections are needed to meet the definition of recurrent UTI, or three or more lower tract infections. Prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended after a single UTI, even in recurrent UTI with renal scarring there is little evidence for their efficacy. There is no need to refer this girl to a urologist either for further investigation or treatment unless her UTI becomes recurrent. An ultrasound scan is unnecessary with a single UTI."
pediatrics,756,A 17-year-old female is referred following a visit to the dentist where marked erosion of her teeth was noted. She was entirely asymptomatic and her only medication was the oral contraceptive pill. On examination her blood pressure was 110/70 mmHg and her body mass index was 21.5 kg/m^2 (18-25).

This suggests a diagnosis of bulimia which may cause a mild hypocalcaemia. Alkaline phosphatase is often raised, due to bone loss resulting from nutritional deficiencies. Hypoparathyroidism is a possible answer as tooth erosion and the like is typical of primary hypoparathyroidism, but the alkaline phosphatase would be expected to be normal/low with this condition. Conn's is unlikely in this age group, is not associated with tooth erosion and hypertension would be expected. Laxative abuse would be associated with hypokalaemia but the hypocalcaemia with raised alkaline phosphatase would not be expected. Early pregnancy would not fit this picture."

Lesions are usually on the face, neck or trunk and are well-circumscribed and lobulated. Treatment options do not include surgical excision. Treatment may be indicated if there is inhibition of normal development - for example impairing normal binocular visual development by obstructing the vision from one eye. It may involve systemic or local steroids, sclerosants, interferon, or laser treatment. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune condition causing discrete areas of hair loss. Treatment options include cortisone injections into the affected areas, and the use of topical cortisone creams."

It occurs in 1:150 males, and is four to five times more common than in females. It affects first born males more commonly and has a high concordance rate among monozygotic twins. The main presenting complaint is that of projectile vomiting which typically starts in the second or third week of life. The vomitus is not bile stained as the condition is caused by the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the antrum of the stomach. Babies with this condition are usually hungry and usually suck well. They often appear wasted and have the appearance of an old man. Electrolyte abnormalities are common with the patient often showing hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia and a profound hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. "
pediatrics,762,A 4-year-old child is found to have the classical murmur of a patent ductus arteriosus. He is underweight for his age but otherwise well. Which of the following would you recommend for this patient?,Delay operation until the child has reached its expected weight for age,Early operative closure,Explain to the parents that this is of little significance and can be ignored,Prophylactic penicillin until operation is performed,"Review the child frequently, expecting spontaneous closure within the next five years",B,Early operative closure is recommended in any patient where the defect has persisted beyond 6 months of age. Prophylactic antibiotics are no longer recommended in this situation for dental and other invasive procedures. 
pediatrics,763,A 3-year-old child brought to the emergency department with a swelling over the left arm. X-ray shows multiple callus formation in the ribs. Exam: bruises on childs back. What is the most appropriate next step?,Check child protection register,Coagulation profile,Skeletal survey,Serum calcium,DEXA scan,C,Skeletal survey is a series of x-ray which is usually used in NAI (non accidental injury)
pediatrics,764,"A 7-year-old boy is brought to the surgery by his mother. He has become unwell with severe diarrhoea which is now mixed with blood. History of note is a visit to a model farm a few days earlier. He is nauseated, has a severe headache, and feels very unwell. On examination he is pyrexial 38.2°C, his BP is 142/88 mmHg. He has a soft, diffusely tender abdomen. Investigations show    Haemoglobin 92 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 11.9 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 76 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 192 μmol/L (60-120)   Bilirubin 92 μmol/L (less than17)   Urine Blood++   Protein ++    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Brucella infection,Campylobacter infection,Escherichia coli infection,Salmonella infection,Shigella infection,C,"The symptoms, signs and investigations are typical of Escherichia coli 157 infection, leading to haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS). The syndrome is characterised by:  Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia Thrombocytopenia, and Acute renal failure.  The most likely route of infection is his trip to the model farm. Unfortunately antibiotics confer no benefit and may increase the risk of neurological complications associated with HUS. This patient should be referred urgently to the hospital for management of his fluid and electrolyte balance. Unfortunately fatality rates from HUS remain high, at between 5 and 10%."
pediatrics,765,"A 15-year-old girl has a suspicious thyroid nodule and the paediatric surgeon feels that this needs to be removed via an open total thyroidectomy. From the structures below, which is at the lowest risk of being injured during the open total thyroidectomy?",External carotid artery,Inferior thyroid artery,Parathyroid gland,Recurrent laryngeal nerve,Superior laryngeal nerve,A,The external carotid artery is the most lateral and furthest structure away from the operative site. All of the other options are close to the thyroid gland and are at risk of damage during thyroid surgery. Damage to any of these structures can have implications. Damage to the parathyroid gland can affect calcium regulation; damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (which is a branch of the vagus nerve) can lead to a hoarse voice. 
pediatrics,766,A 2-year-old girl is brought to clinic for review. She has a known cardiac defect. She has remained well since her last clinic review six months ago and has just started nursery without concern. She is growing on the 25th centile for height and weight. On examination she is pink in air and alert. Her heart rate is 110 beats per minute and her respiratory rate 45 breaths per minute. She has a loud pansystolic murmur and a palpable thrill at the left lower sternal edge. Which single answer is the most appropriate course of management?,Discharge from clinic,Diuretics,High calorie intake,Referral for surgical closure of the defect,Regular follow-up with echocardiography,E,Cardiac murmurs are caused by turbulent blood flow within the heart. A pansystolic murmur at the left lower sternal edge is typical of a ventricular septal defect. Small ventricular septal defects with restrictive flow give rise to loud murmurs whilst large unrestrictive defects may not generate a murmur. The majority of small restrictive ventricular septal defects close by the age of 5 years and in a well child require regular follow up with echocardiography. Surgical closure of small defects is rarely required. Large defects will require referral for definitive surgical closure and initial medical therapy includes diuretics and added calories.
pediatrics,767,A girl aged 5 years attending normal school presents to the outpatient clinic with bilateral enlargement of the breasts. Bone age is 5.8 years and height is on the 90th centile. There has been no vaginal bleeding: Which of the following is correct?,It is desirable to check her karyotype in making a diagnosis,Lateral skull x ray should be requested,Menarche will likely take place in three years,She will need to be treated with clomiphene,The diagnosis is unlikely to be precocious puberty,E,"The diagnosis is unlikely to be precocious puberty as elevated gonadal steroid levels increase height velocity and the rate of skeletal maturation as well causing feminisation and breast development. The condition is more suggestive of premature thelarche. Karyotypic anomalies are not relevant. If central (luteinising hormone-releasing hormone dependent) precocious puberty is suspected then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be of value rather than cranial ultrasound to identify hypothalamic lesions and other central nervous system lesions. However pelvic ultrasound showing normal uterine volume is the most sensitive discriminator between premature thelarche and true precocious puberty. Puberty and menarche should take place at the normally expected timing (11-13 years). LHRH agonists are used in the treatment of precocious puberty of all types and not clomiphene, an oestrogen antagonist."
pediatrics,768,"Regarding childhood acute appendicitis, which of the following is correct?",Appendix mass should not be managed conservatively,Does not occur below the age of two,Faecoliths are rare,Laparoscopic appendicectomy should be considered,Rarely presents with bilious vomiting and abdominal distension,D,"Acute appendicitis can occur at any age. Small children often cannot localise pain, and may present with:  Vomiting Diarrhoea, and Abdominal distension.  Faecoliths are sometimes encountered, and laparoscopic appendicectomy is possible. Appendix mass associated with delayed presentation is usually managed conservatively, and some advocate interval appendicectomy at least six weeks later."
pediatrics,769,"An 8-year-old child presents with pallor, multiple viral illnesses over the last two months and bruises with small non-blanching red spots all over. His parents report that his clothes no longer seem to fit and there are numerous lumps in his neck region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Haemolytic uraemic syndrome,Infectious mononucleosis,Leukaemia,Neuroblastoma,Parvovirus B19 infection,C,"In this child presenting with features of reduction in all the bone marrow cell lines as evidenced by the anaemia (red cells), increased risk of infection (white cells) and petechiae (platelets) the most important diagnosis to rule out is leukaemia. The child also has symptoms of lymphadenopathy and weight loss and these would fit with that diagnosis. There are a number of other causes of aplastic anaemia and the usual presentation is with pancytopenia. It is vital that leukaemia is in your differential list."
pediatrics,770,You are asked to review a 1-day-old infant on the postnatal ward following his day one check. The infant has been noted to have a heart murmur. On examination he is pink in air with no respiratory distress. He has epicanthic folds and a wide nasal bridge with a single palmar crease on his left hand. He has dual heart sounds with a soft systolic murmur at the left upper sternal edge and an apical pansystolic murmur. Both the left and right femoral pulses are palpable. Which is the single most likely cardiac defect present?,Atrial septal defect,Atrioventricular septal defect,Coarctation of the aorta,Ebstein's anomaly,Ventricular septal defect,B,"Thirty per cent of children with Down's syndrome will have congenital heart disease. The most common lesions include atrioventricular septal defects, ventricular septal defects and atrial septal defects. An atrioventricular septal defect results in a common five leaflet atrioventricular valve. The valve leaks leading to an apical pan systolic murmur. The increased pulmonary flow results in a systolic murmur at the left upper sternal edge. Corrective surgery is required to prevent eventual heart failure. Ventricular septal defects classically give rise to pansystolic murmurs at the left lower sternal edge, whist atrial septal defects result in systolic murmurs at the left upper sternal edge. Coarctation of the aorta is characterised by weak or absent femoral pulses. Ebstein's anomaly occurs with maternal lithium use and results in apical displacement of the tricuspid valve and tricuspid regurgitation."
pediatrics,771,"You are called to the delivery of a 36+5/40 infant. Pregnancy was uncomplicated to 36 hours ago when the membranes ruptured. Mother was admitted the following day and developed a fever to 38.6°C. She has been given a single dose of antibiotics four hours ago. Labour has proceeded swiftly. On examination the baby is pale and grunting, with a heart rate of 100/min. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Apgars are 4 at 1 minute and 5 at 5 minutes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Congenital listeriosis,Group B streptococcal septicaemia,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Surfactant deficient lung disease,C,"There has been premature rupture of membranes (PROM), maternal fever, preterm delivery and a flat child delivered. The likely diagnosis is neonatal septicaemia/pneumonia, and the most likely organism is Group B streptococcus. This is carried in the birth canal by 20-30% of women. Early disease usually occurs within six hours of birth. Typical patterns are septicaemia, pneumonia and meningitis. Antibiotics given to mother do not influence the course or time of onset of disease. Late onset disease can occur any time in the first three months but is rarer and more focal (e.g. osteomyelitis)."
pediatrics,772,A 7-year-old boy is brought to clinic with fatigue and weight loss. Examination reveals that he is pale and has hepatosplenomegaly. A full blood count reveals immature white cells. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aplastic anaemia,HIV infection,Hodgkin's lymphoma,Infectious mononucleosis,Leukaemia,E,This child has probable acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) with immature white cells on his full blood count (FBC) being suggestive. This is unlikely to be Hodgkin's disease as the patient is too young and it usually presents with lymphadenopathy. HIV would not cause the presence of immature cells on FBC. 
pediatrics,773,"A 16-year-old girl presents with fever, abdominal pain, loss of appetite, mild diarrhoea, and weight loss over the past three weeks. She also reports joint pain and constantly wants to lie down for most of the day because she feels tired all the time. One week after the onset of fever, a swelling developed over her right shin, which was tender and shiny, associated with several lumps over the groin area, which have subsided. However, other symptoms remained. Clinical examination revealed generalised abdominal tenderness with nothing of note other than a BCG scar. There is no relevant family history and they have dog in their home currently being treated for fleas. Investigations revealed:    White blood cell count 6.7 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Haemoglobin 102 g/L (115-150)   Platelets 220 ×10^9/L 150-400)    Urine analysis is normal. No abnormalities are detected on abdominal ultrasound What is the most likely diagnosis?",Campylobacter infection,Rocky Mountain spotted fever,Salmonella infection,Viral gastroenteritis,Yersinia infection,E,"Yersinia infection is endemic in certain areas of the world, but can be seen anywhere. It is transmitted by flea bites, which can be found in animals. There is an initial presentation with fever and local reaction that involves the lymph nodes. If Yersinia is not recognised and treated appropriately it can be fatal. Prolonged gastroenteritis-like symptoms, erythema nodosum, and lymph node involvement make Yersinia the most likely diagnosis especially when there is a history of exposure to fleas. Abdominal pain is caused by lymphadenitis. Yersinia can be confirmed by cultures or serology studies. Salmonella or viral gastroenteritis will show only gastrointestinal signs with diarrhoea, whereas campylobacter will show bloody diarrhoea. The main presentation in Rocky Mountain spotted fever is headache and rash in addition to fever. "
pediatrics,774,You are rushed to the delivery room to receive a post-term baby because the obstetrician noticed meconium-stained liquor. While waiting for delivery you are told that the mother is primigravida and was given a dose of pethidine 8 hours ago. The baby is born with no cry or respiratory effort. He is covered with thick meconium. What is the next step in the management plan?,Give five inflation breaths,Give naloxone 0.01 mg/kg,Stimulate by back rubbing,Stimulate by back slapping,Suctioning under direct laryngoscopy,A,"Meconium aspiration syndrome is defined as respiratory distress caused by the presence of meconium in the airway immediately after birth.  Previous guidance was to aspirate under direct suction a non-vigorous baby if meconium was visible, however, the 2015 guidelines have changed-:  andquot;Attempts to aspirate meconium from the nose and mouth of the unborn infant, while the head is still on the perineum, are not recommended. The emphasis should be on initiating lung inflation within the first minute of life in non-breathing or ineffectively breathing infants and this should not be delayed. If presented with a floppy, apnoeic infant born through thick particulate meconium it is reasonable to inspect the oropharynx rapidly to remove potential obstructions. Tracheal intubation should not be routine in the presence of meconium and should only be performed for suspected tracheal obstructionandquot;  Because pethidine has a half-life of 3.5 hours, it is highly unlikely that naloxone will add any benefit for this child even if he was not meconium stained. Additionally, the resuscitation guideline recommends stimulation and inflation breaths before naloxone even if there was a strong suspicion of pethidine-related neonatal respiratory depression. Stimulation should be by back rubbing rather than slapping. "
pediatrics,775,"An 18-month-old girl presents with pallor. She has always been a poor eater, and survives mainly on bottles of milk. She was born at 37+2/40 weighing 2.7 kg and there were no neonatal problems. On examination she looks pale but not icteric. Her temperature is 36.8°C (tympanic), HR 100/min and RR 15/min. She has a grade 2/6 ejection murmur at the left sternal edge. She has no hepatosplenomegaly nor bruising. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Haemaglobinopathies e.g. sickle, Thalassaemia",Iron deficiency,Malignancy,Marrow failure,Occult blood loss,B,"The history suggests an inadequate diet following difficulties in weaning. She almost certainly has iron deficiency anaemia. A full blood count shows Hb 33 g/L, with MCV of 64. Treatment with 3/12 of oral iron will replenish iron stores. Mother should be given dietetic advice."
pediatrics,776,A 7days baby whose birth weight was 3.5kg and now is 3kg.

It is normal. So the option is continue regular child care
pediatrics,777,"A 6-year-old child is referred to the general paediatric outpatient clinic with a history of waking in the middle of the night, terrified and shouting out loud. His parents feel that he is hallucinating. He does not respond to his parents when they try to talk to him and reassure him. Shortly afterwards he goes back to sleep and has no recollection of the event the following morning.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Childhood affective disorder,Nightmares,Night terrors,Normal behaviour,Status epilepticus in slow wave sleep,C,"Night terrors are commonly seen in children between the ages of 4 to 7 years. The child awakes from stage 4 deep slow wave sleep and appears terrified and hallucinating. The child is unresponsive to anyone around them. After less than 15 minutes the child falls asleep again and the following morning has no recollection of the events. When a child awakens from a nightmare they are aware of where they are, are responsive and can recall the dream either immediately or the following morning. Childhood affective disorder would also show features during the day time and would be more likely to present with nightmares as night terrors are generally not associated with any underlying stressful events. Status epilepticus in slow wave sleep may present with seizures during the day or night and often these seizures take the form of absences, myoclonic seizures or partial tonic clonic seizures. Usually the child feels refreshed in the morning despite significantly disturbed sleep patterns. SESWS is associated with reduced school performance and receptive and expressive dysphasia."
pediatrics,778,You are asked by the midwife to see a 2-hour-old term baby who is struggling to feed and who is noted to have increased secretions coming from his mouth despite several attempts to remove the secretions by suction. There is an antenatal history of polyhydramnios. On examination the baby looks well and stable with no increase in respiratory effort. What is the next step in the management plan?,Attempt to feed after one hour as there are no signs of respiratory distress,Order an echocardiogram,Perform an endotracheal suction,Try to insert a nasogastric tube and take a chest x ray,Urgent referral to an ENT specialist for bronchoscopy,D,"This patient has clinical signs (increased secretions) and risk factors (polyhydramnios) consistent with trachea-oesophageal fistula. Attempting to feed this patient will lead to respiratory compromise. Attempting to insert a nasogastric tube and taking an x ray is probably the simplest procedure that is readily available to diagnose oesphageal atresia. Tracheo-oesophageal fistulas have several forms and come in different presentations. One of the presentations is shown in this question; however, the neonate may have signs of respiratory distress. In addition, it may not present until later in life as in H-type fistula. They are associated with polyhydramnios. Tracheo-oesophageal fistula can be part of the more extensive VACTRL syndrome. So an echocardiogram should be requested but at a later stage. Performing endotracheal suction is an invasive procedure with no diagnostic value. Performing a bronchoscopy may be needed to diagnose an H-type fistula, but it is an invasive procedure and certainly not indicated at this stage. "
pediatrics,779,"A 7-year-old girl presents with mouth breathing and throat discomfort, present for several weeks over the Spring. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. Her sister has asthma and mother eczema. On examination she is apyrexial, with respiratory rate 14/min and pulse 85/min. She is alert and well perfused. She has a clear nasal discharge with boggy swollen nares. She constantly wrinkles her nose and clears her throat. Conjunctivae are bilaterally pink. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Foreign body,Group A streptococcal infection,Paratonsillar abscess,Postnasal drip,A,The history is of clear rhinorrhoea and non-purulent conjunctivitis since Spring. This points to allergy as the cause of symptoms. Nose wrinkling ('rabbit nose') and rubbing the palm on the nose ('atopic salute') are characteristic of this condition. Treatment is with oral antihistamines or topical steroids.
pediatrics,780,Which of the following is an indication for surgical treatment of hiatus hernia with gastro-oesophageal reflux in children?,Anaemia,Duodenal ulceration,Hiatus hernia still present after the age of 2 years,Recurrent chest infection,Vomiting,D,Indications for surgical operation in children with hiatus hernia include persistent symptoms such as oesophagitis and recurrent chest infection. Vomiting is not in itself an indication for surgery as it is not an unusual symptom and is one which may settle with appropriate treatment. Duodenal ulceration is rare in children and not associated with hiatus hernia.
pediatrics,781,"A 7-year-old girl presents with a one day history of florid rash over her face and trunk. She has had a sore throat treated for seven days by her family doctor with amoxicillin; otherwise she has been well. She was born at term weighing 3.26 kg and there were no neonatal problems. She is fully immunised and there is no family history or social history of note. On examination she is apyrexial and well, with no jaundice or lymphadenopathy. She has a florid confluent blanching pink rash all over her face and trunk, with less on her limbs. ENT examination is unremarkable and there is no abdominal organomegaly. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Drug reaction,Erythema multiforme,Infectious mononucleosis,Kawasaki disease,Scarlet fever,A,"The history of florid rash seven days after amoxicillin suggests a drug reaction. If Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is present a rash is seen in 90%, and appears within a day or two of amoxicillin starting. There may also be other signs of EBV infection, such as jaundice, lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly. The rash will disappear even if amoxicillin is continued, suggesting that it does not have an allergic basis. "
pediatrics,782,"An 18-month-old boy presented to the GP with faltering growth, chronic diarrhoea, mild anaemia and abdominal distension. Which would be the most appropriate test to confirm a diagnosis of coeliac disease?",Initial small intestine biopsy then formal gluten challenge with repeat biopsy,Measure endomysial antibody and transglutaminase antibody levels,Measure total serum total IgA levels and endomysial antibody testing,Small intestine biopsy on a gluten-containing diet,Small intestine biopsy on a gluten-free diet,A,"Coeliac disease is a reversible immune-mediated enteropathy caused by a permanent sensitivity to gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. It is associated with crypt hyperplastic villous atrophy and abnormal surface epithelium. Classical presentation is between weaning age and two years, with intestinal symptoms, although late extraintestinal symptoms such as anaemia, short stature and hepatitis can occur. Coeliac disease is associated with IgA deficiency therefore any serological testing must also control for potential IgA deficiency by measuring total serum IgA levels and if in doubt use IgG levels. Serological tests are corroborative, a biopsy is required in all cases. NICE guidelines on Coeliac disease (NG20) give guidance on diagnostic criteria and procedures. A small intestine biopsy is the only definitive way to diagnose coeliac disease. The child in this question is only 18-months-old. If a child is less than 2 years of age, an additional biopsy should be taken after a formal gluten challenge as there are other causes of enteropathy and the classical flat mucosa found on histology in this age group, including cow's milk protein intolerance. Children should not be started on a gluten free diet on the basis of an antibody test; a biopsy must also be performed. A single biopsy is adequate to make diagnosis, provided the child is over 2 years of age. The histology is absolutely typical and the child undergoes complete remission on gluten withdrawal. To diagnose coeliac disease, the child must be eating a diet containing gluten at the time of biopsy."

G6PD deficiency, Pyruvate Kinase deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary elliptocytosis are the archetypes for these two groups. Hereditary spherocytosis is due to spectin deficiency resulting in abnormal cytoskeleton and reduced cell deformation. The percentage of spherocytes at particular concentrations of Hb allow the diagnosis to be made by Coulter counter, rather than waiting to do osmotic fragility when they are older.   "

pediatrics,791,"You are reviewing the likely dosing schedule for a trial of a novel antibiotic in the paediatric population. It is partially metabolised by the CYP 450 enzyme system and partially renally excreted. Oral absorption, liver metabolism and renal excretion all have to be taken into account when considering the dosing schedule. With respect to dosing the drug in a 4-year-old which of the following needs to be taken into consideration? ",You will need to increase the dose because oral absorption is likely to be reduced,You will need to reduce from BD to OD dosing because the half life will be longer,You will need to reduce the dose because of body weight / surface area differences versus an adult,You will need to reduce the dose because of reduced P450 activity,You will need to reduce the dose because renal blood flow is less than that seen in an adult,C,"The answer is that you will need to reduce the dose because of body weight / surface area differences as opposed to an adult. In a child aged 4, this is the most important reason for dose adjustment. The majority of dosing schedules recommend adjustment by weight in a child from this age group. Some agents where a very accurate dose titration schedule is required, for example, chemotherapeutic agents, dose by body surface area. In a child of 4 years, absorption, P450 activity and renal blood flow would all be expected to be at similar levels to those seen in an adult. As such absorption, metabolism and excretion are not important reasons in a child of 4 years for reducing dose. In neonates however both hepatic enzyme activity and renal blood flow are below adult levels and therefore do impact on drug dosing."
pediatrics,792,Which of the following is the best initial treatment for a boy of 6-months-old with a lower urinary tract infection?,"3 day course of oral antibiotics, the choice of which as guided by the local antimicrobial policy",3 day course of oral co-amoxiclav,"7 day course of oral antibiotics, the choice of which as guided by local antimicrobial policy",7 day course of oral co-amoxiclav,48 hours of IV antibiotics then subsequent oral antibiotics,A,"Following a systematic review which found that there was no significant difference between short and long term outcomes (that is, a positive urine culture) after short compared to standard duration antibiotic therapy, the NICE guidelines advise only a three day course with oral antibiotics for children over 3 months of age with a lower UTI. Parents are key in the safe management of children with UTIs in primary care - they should be advised to bring the child back for reassessment if they have any concerns or of they are still unwell at 24-48 hours. Both a 3 day course or 7 day course of oral co-amoxiclav is incorrect. The choice of antibiotic should be directed by local antibiotic policy. 48 hours of IV antibiotics then subsequent oral antibiotics is incorrect since IV antibiotics are not required. A 7 day course of oral antibiotics, co-amoxiclav or otherwise, is incorrect since only three days of oral antibiotics are required. "
pediatrics,793,Which of the following enzyme defects is associated with a characteristic body odour?,Alkaptonuria,Branched chain ketoacid decarboxylase,Galactose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase,Methyl malonic aciduria,Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency,B,"The following inborn errors of amino acid metabolism are associated with abnormal odours:  Glutaric acidaemia type II - sweaty feet Hawkinsinuria - swimming pool Isovaleric acidaemia - sweaty feet Maple syrup urine disease - maple syrup Methionine malabsorption - cabbage Multiple carboxylase deficiency - tomcat urine Oasthouse urine disease - hops-like Phenylketonuria - mousy or musty Trimethylaminuria - rotting fish Tyrosinaemia - rancid, fishy or cabbage-like.  In addition, ketones may be smelt in diabetic ketoacidosis, and some intermediary disorders of fatty acid metabolism can result in fishy smells. The general rule is that if a child smells peculiar he requires a metabolic work-up. "
pediatrics,794,"An 8-week-old girl is referred with heart murmur, discovered at a 6/52 surveillance check. She is otherwise well and gaining weight. She was born at term weighing 3.28 kg and there were no neonatal problems. She has had no immunisations. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she is apyrexial, with respiratory rate 40/min and pulse 110/min. She has a 2/6 murmur best heard between the scapulae, and her femoral pulses are weak. 2 cm of liver are palpable. Blood pressure in the right arm is 80/60 mmHg, in the right leg 60/40 mmHg. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic coarctation,Arteriovenous malformation,Phaeochromocytoma,Subclavian steal syndrome,Vesicoureteric reflux with renal scarring,A,"The picture is a well child with heart murmur, weak femorals and gradient in BP between arms and legs. This suggests aortic coarctation, which can be confirmed by echocardiography. Treatment is surgical, with monitoring of BP long-term thereafter, as hormone secretion from the hypoperfused kidneys can be prolonged or self-sustaining. Antibiotic prophylaxis is no longer recommended to reduce the risk of endocarditis."
pediatrics,795,An 8-year-old girl is complying with her asthma treatment of low-dose inhaled corticosteroid prophylaxis and short-acting bronchodilators as required. Her inhaler technique is good. She now has a frequent night cough and mild exercise-induced wheeze. What would be the SINGLE most appropriate change in her treatment?,Add leukotriene antagonist,Add oral theophylline,Add regular long-acting bronchodilator,Increase dose of inhaled corticosteroid,Short course of oral corticosteroid,A,According to latest NICE guideline
pediatrics,796,"A 6-year-old boy is clinically obese, his BMI >95th centile. He has no other medical problems, examination is unremarkable. His mother says that she has tried everything to help him lose weight. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Cushing’s syndrome,Congenital hypothyroidism,Down’s syndrome,Lawrence moon biedel syndrome,Primary obesity,E,"People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI) is over 30 kg/m2. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental disorder"
pediatrics,797,An infant is admitted with diarrhoea and a diagnosis of Rotavirus is suspected. Which one of the following is correct regarding Rotavirus infection?,Blood and mucus is found in the stools of about 50% of affected babies,It occurs most often in the summer months,It typically affects infants older than 18 months,Protection is not conferred by breast feeding,The Rotazyme test to detect virus particles is a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay,E,Watery diarrhoea is common and blood and mucus is rare. Epidemics occur in the cooler months. The peak incidence of Rota virus infection is 3-15 months. Breast feeding protects against Rota virus diarrhoea and other infections e.g. pneumonia. ELISA is performed on the stool samples to detect virus particles.
pediatrics,798,"A 6-year-old girl has had 2 short episodes of cough and wheeze over the last 12 months. These 2 acute episodes responded quickly to bronchodilator, she has no symptoms or abnormal physical signs. She has slight eczema and her mother has asthma. What is the single most appropriate investigation?",CXR,Peak flow rate diary,Pulse oximetry,Spirometry,Sweat test,D,spirometry is the preferred initial test (if available) to assess the presence and severity of airflow obstruction less effort dependent and more repeatable though less applicable in acute severe asthma
pediatrics,799,"A 9-month-old child is referred with pallor, vomiting and diarrhoea. He became unwell 48 hours ago, and has rapidly deteriorated. He has wet his nappy once in the past 24 hours. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. His immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 37.8°C, respiratory rate 40/min and heart rate 160/min. He has cool mottled peripheries and a capillary refill time of four seconds. Pulses are equal in all four limbs. He responds weakly to voice. His abdomen is soft and skin turgor reduced. What is the most likely type of shock?",Anaemic,Cardiogenic,Distributive,Hypovolaemic,Septic,D,"The history suggests dehydration and shock, resulting in vasoconstriction and poor peripheral perfusion. In this situation the skin takes on a marbled appearance and feels cool. He requires oxygen, confirmation of airway and breathing, then intravenous access and 20 ml/kg of N. saline to treat the shock. Serum electrolytes will guide further rehydration. Correction over 48 hours is needed in hypernatraemic dehydration (Na greater than155 mmol/L) to minimise the risk of cerebral oedema."
pediatrics,800,"A 14-year-old girl presents six hours after ingestion of 23 paracetamol (acetaminophen) tablets. Her paracetamol level is 155 mcg/l. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. She previously overdosed three months ago, also with paracetamol. Her immunisations are up to date. She has recently felt under pressure from exams, and has fallen out with her boyfriend of two years. On examination she is apyrexial, alert and cooperative. She has multiple linear scratches on the left wrist. Examination is otherwise normal. Which of the options best suits the scenario?",Bipolar disorder,Depression,Parasuicide,Personality disorder,Schizophrenia,C,"The history of repeated overdose and scars, suggesting that she has contemplated slashing her wrists, suggests significant psychological disturbance. Three serious prognostic features are:  Previous attempts Mood disorder, and Substance abuse.  Prior planning (for example, leaving a suicide note, accumulating tablets) also bodes badly. In the United Kingdom, paracetamol and aspirin are only available in packs of 16 (supermarkets and convenience stores), so a 23 tablet ingestion would probably require prior planning.   "
pediatrics,801,"A 2-week-old girl presents with a history of poor feeding, worse over the last six hours. 38+3/40, 2.95 kg, no problems at birth. First pregnancy of healthy Caucasian mother. No FH/SH of note. No drugs nor immunisations. On examination temperature is 35.4°C (tympanic), RR 60/min, HR 160/min on monitor (all pulses impalpable). Cold mottled peripheries, capillary refill time six seconds. Oxygen saturations 45% in air. Gallop rhythm, 4 cm hepatomegaly, no spleen. No bruising or rash. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Escherichia coli septicaemia,Galactosaemia,Group B streptococcal infection,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,E,"The history is of shock, hepatomegaly and hypoxia in a 2-week-old child. The most likely diagnosis is duct-dependent congenital heart disease. Left heart lesions causing this presentation include:  aortic coarctation/hypoplastic arch truncus arteriosus critical aortic stenosis, and hypoplastic left heart syndrome.  Right-sided lesions include:  transposition severe Fallot's, and pulmonary atresia +/- VSD.  After intubation and ventilation the key step is to open the duct using prostaglandin E2 infusion. Acidosis may require separate correction. Urgent transfer to a cardiac centre should then follow so a specific diagnosis can be made. "
pediatrics,802,"A 15-year-old girl is admitted to the endocrinology ward for investigation of frequent syncopal attacks. She claims that before each attack occurs she feels faint, sweaty and extremely hungry. Her father has a history of type 2 diabetes for which he takes metformin and gliclazide. Physical examination is entirely unremarkable, her BP is 105/65 mmHg and pulse is 70 and regular. Her BMI is 21. Which of the following is the investigation most likely to reveal the underlying diagnosis?",72 hour fast followed by exercise,C peptide measurement during an attack,Glucose measurement during an attack,Insulin measurement during an attack,Urinary sulphonylurea measurement,E,"Given the history of type 2 diabetes in this patient's father, the most likely diagnosis is illicit use of gliclazide precipitating the episodes of hypoglycaemia. Because SUs lead to an increase in endogenous insulin production, it is measurement of the SU itself, in urine which is the most appropriate screening test. Insulin, glucose and C peptide measurement during a hypoglycaemic episode is particularly useful where exogenous insulin administration is suspected. In this situation insulin levels are elevated, but C peptide is not. A 72 hour fast followed by exercise is rarely performed, and may actually precipitate dangerous hypoglycaemia where insulinoma exists."
pediatrics,803,A mother presents her 6 month old son who is vocalizing. She has noticed that he doesn’t respond to loud noises. His motor milestones are normal. What is the best management strategy?,Arrange hearing test,Assess development milestones,Reassure,Refer to speech therapist,MRI brain,A,Normal motor milestones indicate normal development but unable to respond to loud noise at 6 months may indicate deafness
pediatrics,804,"A 3-year-old girl presents with redness and swelling below the jaw of two weeks duration. This initially looked like a boil, and has now burst with purulent discharge. She has otherwise been well. She had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal problems. Her immunisations are up to date. There is no family or social history of note. On examination the temperature is 36.7°C, respiratory rate 20/min and pulse 100/min. The lesion is firm 5 cm across, indurated, with central defect of 1 cm full of purulent discharge. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial adenitis,Bullous impetigo,Cellulitis,HIV,Mycobacterial adenitis,E,The history of cervical lymphadenopathy in the anterior triangle with persistent discharge in an otherwise healthy child suggests atypical mycobacterial infection. This is usually due to Mycobacterium avium. Treatment is by excision biopsy. Needle biopsy is often associated with fistula formation. 
pediatrics,805,"A 15-month-old girl presents with pallor. This has gradually become more noticable with time. Though a very picky eater, she has not been unwell in herself. Full term normal delivery, no neonatal problems. Immunisations up to date. The parents are both unemployed and money is tight. On examination the temperature is 36.4°C, respiratory rate 25/min and pulse 100/min. Conjunctivae are pale. There is a grade 2/6 ejection systolic murmur maximal at the upper left sternal edge. No liver is palpable and pulses are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?","Anaemia, B12 deficiency","Anaemia, chronic disease","Anaemia, folate deficiency","Anaemia, iron deficiency",Lead poisoning,D,"The history suggests poor eating on a background of poverty. The likely explanation for the pallor is iron-deficiency due to inadequate iron intake. This is easily treated with oral iron for three months (to replenish body iron stores). Dietary advice should be given, though the family may find this difficult to follow for financial reasons. Pulmonary flow murmurs are commonly heard in anaemia. "
pediatrics,806,Which of the following is not a characteristic feature of physiological jaundice?,A serum bilirubin level below 250 mmol/L,Associated anaemia,Disappearance by the tenth day of life,Normal feeding behaviour,Onset after the first 24 hours of life,B,"Physiological jaundice occurs in 90% of infants and manifests after the first two to three days of life. It is related to increased red cell breakdown and relative 'immaturity' of hepatic function. Anaemia, if present, would imply a pathological cause of jaundice, for example, haemolytic anaemia."
pediatrics,807,"A study has been designed to investigate whether a certain drug plus physiotherapy treatment is better than drug treatment alone in the management of rheumatoid arthritis. After randomising the patients, a small proportion of the drug plus physiotherapy group decide to drop out of the study or omit some treatment sessions specified in the research protocol. What is the correct way of analysing the subsequent data?",Assume the patients have withdrawn their consent,Exclude these patients from all analysis,Extend the trial recruitment to make up the numbers,Include these patient outcomes in the drug plus physiotherapy group,Interview the patients and report their group separately,D,This is the principle of 'intention to treat'. It is possible that the physiotherapy intervention was harmful to the patients and this is why they left. Intention to treat helps to reduce bias by sticking to the original allocation of treatment and analysing the patient in that treatment group even if they do not recieve the treatment.
pediatrics,808,A 3-year-old child is investigated for recurrent chest infections with green sputum production. Her chest x ray reveals ring shadows and bronchial wall thickening of both bases. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aspiration pneumonia,Bronchiectasis,Foreign body inspissation,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Tuberculosis,B,This patient has a history of recurrent chest infections with x ray appearances suggesting bronchiectasis. The most likely explanation for these features would be cystic fibrosis.
pediatrics,809,An 11-year-old boy presents with fever for 4 days. Which of the following support a diagnosis of rheumatic fever?,A generalised macular-papular rash,ASO titre of less than 1:200,Polyarthritis,Staphylococcus aureus grown on throat culture,Splinter haemorrhages,C,"Of the following Jones criteria, two major or one major and two minor, and evidence of recent streptococcal infection, is required for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever (RF).

What is the single next best investigation?",Catheter catch of urine,Clean catch of urine,US,IVU,Suprapubic catch of urine,B,The clinical features described are consistent with urinary tract infection for which clean catch of urine is the next best investigation
pediatrics,811,A 3-year-old boy is brought in to the Emergency department by his mother because of a fall. You take a detailed past history and are concerned that there may be child neglect. Which of the following medical conditions would make you consider child neglect?,An episode of head lice infestation treated a month ago,An episode of otitis media now resolved,Bruising to the left elbow after tripping on the doorstep,Marked dental tooth decay,Parental refusal of immunisations after discussion with the general practitioner,D,"The tooth decay suggests that dental hygiene has not been carried out and dental treatment not sought. The other conditions are not of concern unless appropriate treatment was not sought. Refusing immunisations is not a sign of neglect, but repeatedly failing to engage in any discussion about it or failing to keep appointments would be of more concern. "
pediatrics,812,A 4-year-old child attends the local community clinic with failure to thrive. His mother tells you he is a very fussy child and will eat only white rice. He has adequate rice to fulfil his calorie requirements. Which vitamin deficiency is he likely to have?,"Vitamin A, B1 and C",Vitamin B1 only,"Vitamin B1, B2, B12 and C",Vitamin C only,Vitamin C and E,C,"Many people worldwide are dependent on rice to meet their nutritional requirements. Rice is the staple food for much of Asia and impoverished populations (or fussy eaters) may eat little else. White rice, with the husk and bran removed, is particularly low in vitamin B1 (thiamine). In fact, beriberi due to thiamine deficiency was common in Japanese soldiers during the Second World War. Thiamine deficiency can cause 'wet' or 'dry' beriberi and the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) is also commonly deficient in rice-eating populations. Riboflavin is required for metabolism of carbohydrates and fats. Riboflavin is found in cheese, fish and leafy green vegetables. Vitamin B12 is found in animal products and is commonly deficient in vegetarian diets. Vitamin B12 is required for the formation of normal red blood cells, DNA synthesis and protein and fat metabolism. Vitamin C is required for healthy skin and mucous membranes and has an antioxidant function in the body. Vitamin C deficiency is known as scurvy."
pediatrics,813,"A 6-week-old male infant is reviewed on the paediatric ward with a pyrexia of 39°C. He was born at term by normal delivery, his antenatal USS showed mild right sided hydronephrosis at 20 weeks but this was no longer apparent on follow up scan at 32 weeks. He is irritable and lethargic and has vomited all his feeds that day. A full septic screen is performed and the baby is commenced on IV ceftriaxone pending results. The blood results are shown below: Blood and CSF culture - no growth at 48 hours    Haemoglobin 150 g/L (130 - 180)   White cell count 26 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Neutrophils 20 ×10^9/L (1.5 - 7)   Platelet 300 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   WBC 180 -   RBC 10 -       Culture Escherichia coli       CRP 58 mg/L less than10    He is treated with five days of IV antibiotics with good effect and then discharged home. You note from his medical notes that he was admitted three weeks ago and also had a positive urine culture. Follow-up investigations are arranged. An ultrasound scan done six weeks later shows mild bilateral hydronephrosis with bilateral ureteral dilatation and a thick-walled bladder. A micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) shows a thickened, trabeculated bladder with a hypertrophied bladder neck and a dilated urethra. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pelviureteric junction obstruction,Posterior urethral valves,Prune-belly syndrome,Ureterocele,Vesicoureteric reflux,B,"This infant has a history of recurrent urinary tract infections at a very young age with an uncertain antenatal history regarding hydronephrosis. Due to the recurrent UTIs, he required an USS six weeks post-UTI and an MCUG. A DMSA should be arranged for four to six months later to assess for renal scarring/damage in accordance with the NICE guidelines. The USS findings show evidence of obstructive uropathy. The findings of a thickened, trabeculated bladder and dilated urethra on MCUG are highly suggestive of posterior urethral valves. An MCUG is the investigation of choice for posterior urethral valves as sometimes, but not always, the valves themselves can be visualised or the urethra can be shown to be dilated, elongated and posterior. Prune-belly syndrome is characterised by lax abdominal musculature, dilated bladder and ureters and undescended testis; there is usually a neurogenic bladder.  A ureterocele is dilatation of the distal ureter leading to obstruction, the bladder is normal and this is usually unilateral. Pelviureteric junction obstruction is usually unilateral, diagnosed on antenatal USS and presents with an abdominal mass; there is gross hydronephrosis associated with decreased renal function but no ureteral dilatation. Vesicoureteric reflux may be a feature of posterior urethral valves and other conditions but in and of itself would not show evidence of bladder abnormalities on USS or MCUG."
pediatrics,814,"A 4-year-old by presents with a two day history of coryza and cough, particularly at night. On examination he has Harrison's sulci and is on the third centile for weight and height. Chest auscultation reveals scattered wheeze. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Cystic fibrosis,Gastroesophageal reflux,Sinusitis,Virus-induced wheeze,A,The examination findings suggest chronic under-treated asthma. If he does not respond rapidly to asthma therapy a sweat test may be indicated to exclude cystic fibrosis. It is likely that he will respond to regular inhaled low-dose steroids.   
pediatrics,815,"An 18-month old girl with a respiratory illness is being examined in the Emergency department. Half way through the examination an umbilical hernia is found. It is reducible, non-tender, has been present since birth, and is asymptomatic. What is the most appropriate management?",Advise the parents to see the GP to get referred to a paediatric surgeon as soon as possible,"Advise the parents to see the GP when she is over 3 years of age, at which point she can be referred to a paediatric surgeon if still present",Reassure the parents that umbilical hernias never cause problems and hence it does not require surgical intervention,Refer to the surgical registrar on call,Write a referral to the surgical consultant on call to see in the next available outpatient clinic,B,"The incidence of umbilical hernias in infancy ranges from 2-18.5% in white children to 25-58% in African-American children. The incidence in premature and low birth weight infants is even higher - up to 75% in infants 500-1500 g. There is an increased incidence in children with the following conditions:  Congenital hypothyroidism Trisomy 13, 18, and 21 Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Hurler's syndrome, and Peritoneal dialysis.  Umbilical hernias are unique among hernias because they have the potential to close spontaneously over time. Studies have shown that spontaneous resolution occurs in 83-95% of white and African-American populations by 6 years. Half of the umbilical hernias present at 4-5 years of age will close spontaneously by 11 years of age. Some studies suggest that larger defects greater than1.5 cm are less likely to close spontaneously, whereas others dispute this. Please note that the size of the overlying skin does not directly relate to the size of the underlying fascial defect. Commonly, surgeons offer an umbilical hernia repair if still present after 3 years of age. It involves a simple day case procedure resulting in a small scar normally hidden within the umbilicus. Parents should be advised to take their child to the Emergency department if the hernia becomes stuck out, red, or painful, or the child gets bilious/green vomiting in the interim. However, they can be reassured that it is rare (less than1%). "

She has large slightly tender cervical lymphadenopathy. Her tonsils are bilaterally enlarged and covered in white exudate. There are a few petechiae on the palate. She has a scanty maculopapular rash over the trunk. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Group A streptococcal infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Paratonsillar abscess,Tonsillitis,Viral infection,B,"The history is of gradual onset of fever and tonsillitis, with marked exudates. Clinically it is not possible reliably to distinguish between viral and bacterial infection. Bacterial infection is made more likely by:  absence of coryza high fever palatal petechiae, and age 5-15 years.  In this case the presence of the rash make a mononuclear illness more likely. The new boyfriend makes 'kissing disease' (Epstein-Barr virus or EBV) the prime suspect. "
pediatrics,817,Which one of the following statements is correct concerning glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency?,Blood transfusions are not indicated,Is an indication for splenectomy,Is associated with drug induced haemolysis,It is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition,The condition is more severe in males,C,G6PDH deficiency is an X linked recessive condition. It manifests more commonly in males but is not more severe. Drugs which cause haemolysis include:  aspirin antimalarials antibacterials and sulphonamides.  Splenectomy is not helpful in the management of this condition. Blood transfusions may be life saving.
pediatrics,818,Which one of the following statements is true of Munchausen's syndrome by proxy?,It is a cause of sudden infant death,The carer genuinely belives the child to be ill,The carer is likely to have a schizophrenia,The child's life is not usually in immediate danger,The person responsible is more likely to be the father,A,"Munchausen's syndrome by proxy is a parenting disorder where parents, usually the mother, fabricate symptoms in their children, thus subjecting the child to unnecessary medical tests and/or surgical procedures. In some cases, the parents also inflict injury and can kill their children in the process. "
pediatrics,819,How do MHC class 2 proteins on donor cells contribute or interfere with the process of graft rejection following BMT?,They act as receptors for interleukin-2 which is produced by macrophages as they attack the donor cells,"They are broken down and presented to T lymphocytes, leading to their differentiation to plasma cells and subsequent production of antibody against the donor cells","They are recognised by T helper cells, leading to the activation of cytotoxic T killer cells which kill the donor cells",They induce the production of IgE leading to a hypersensitivity reaction against the graft,They lead to immune tolerance by interacting with immature T cells,C,"MHC class 2 proteins are found on macrophages, dendritic cells and B lymphocytes. They are heterodimeric molecules that are involved in the presentation of antigen from extracellular sources, unlike MHC class I which present cytosolic fragments. Furthermore, donor CD4+ TH-1 lymphocytes will recognise foreign MHC class 2 molecules, leading to their activation and proliferation. The combination of disparities between MHC class 1 and MHC class 2 leads to an expansion of cytotoxic T lymphocytes targeting the graft. The IL-2 receptor on donor cells does not play a role in graft rejection. The MHC proteins may be broken down and presented if graft cells are killed; T lymphocytes do not produce antibody. The graft rejection is not IgE mediated. Foreign MHC class 2 will not generate immune tolerance in the donor."
pediatrics,820,"A 14-year-old overweight boy presents with Tanner stage 3 breast development which he has had for approximately 12 months. He is very distressed and refuses to go swimming in case anyone sees him. On examination, he is pubertal with Tanner stage 3 genitalia, pubic hair and 10 ml testes. He is not on any regular medication and hCG levels are normal. What is the most likely cause?",Idiopathic,Marijuana,McCune-Albright syndrome,Oestrogen secreting tumour,Spironolactone,A,Idiopathic gynaecomastia is very common and is thought to affect up to 75% of pubertal boys. Unless severe it usually resolves in late puberty and is often more pronounced in the obese. Marijuana is incorrect as it is a rare cause of gynaecomastia. As the boy is not taking any regular medication the gynaecomastia is unlikely to be sprinolactone induced. Oestrogen-secreting tumours can cause gynaecomastia but are very rare.
pediatrics,821,"A 12-year-old boy with T1DM (type1 diabetes mellitus) has poor long-term control. He is unconscious, hyperventilating and dehydrated. His blood glucose is 28mmol/l.

pediatrics,822,"A newborn infant of a diabetic mother is found by the midwife on the postnatal ward with involuntary contraction of his muscles. The midwife stokes his cheek to gain a response but this only makes the movement worse. She calls for the paediatric SHO and checks a blood sugar level, which is 3.6 mmol/L. The paediatric SHO reviews the baby and thinks he is fitting so admits him to SCBU. Bloods are sent with the calcium level returning at 1.2 mmo/L. What should you administer in the emergency treatment of this infant?","1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol",10% Calcium gluconate intravenous bolus,Calcium Sandoz oral supplement,10% Dextrose intravenous bolus,Magnesium sulphate,B,"Hypocalcaemia is common in newborn infants and is seen in:  Prematurity Infants with hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, and Infants of diabetic mothers.  The serum calcium is low and the phosphate level is elevated. Alkaline phosphatase is normal or high and 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol is usually lower. Magnesium levels can be normal, but should be checked in any child with low calcium. As this infant presents with neonatal tetany, the child should have an emergency injection of 10% calcium gluconate whilst being observed with a cardiac monitor. 1,25 dihydroxycholecalciferol should also be given, but is not first line given the clinical presentation. The blood sugar level in this infant is normal so a 10% dextrose bolus is not warranted."

At the point of menarche the girl will have completed the majority of her pubertal changes and the growth spurt will be at its end. Tanner staging is vital knowledge. In girls breast development and pubic hair growth are assessed:  An areola which projects above the breast is at stage 4 (adult breast is stage 5) Dark, coarse pubic hair is stage 3.   In an adult distribution is stage 4 and in a quantity and type with spread towards the inguinal creases is stage 5."

He is otherwise well with no other symptoms, other than his mother reporting he is andquot;not a morning personandquot;. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",ADHD,Autism,Childhood epilepsy syndrome,Conduct disorder,Obstructive sleep apnoea,E,"Obstructive sleep apnoea leads to hypoxia, which interrupts the sleep cycle. It is rarely enough to result in complete wakening, but is sufficient to disrupt sleep. It mostly affects the child during REM sleep, so snoring or disturbed sleep are often not witnessed. It is important to identify the cause early because it is easily missed, and can, if untreated, cause long-term learning and memory problems. Although ADHD and conduct disorder may present with hyperactivity and disruptive behaviour, the vacant behaviour (due to tiredness) in the afternoon would not be characteristic. Autism would present with withdrawal from social situations and fixation on detail. There is no history of seizures in this child. "
pediatrics,827,"You are a GP who has noted an increase in accidents in children attending your practice and want to find out where children are most at risk. According to data from Accident Prevention Amongst Children and Young People, what is the most common location of accidents involving 0-17-year-olds that result in emergency hospital admission?",Farm,Home,School,Sports/athletics grounds,Transport,B,"After infancy, accidental injury is the main cause of death in children in the United Kingdom. Socioeconomic inequalities in accidental death and injury remain very marked, despite the absolute rates of death from injury falling over the last few decades. For example, the children of parents who have never worked are 13 times more likely to die from unintentional injury and 37 times more likely to die from exposure to smoke, fire or flames. Injury is also the most common cause of physical disability in young adults. Transport accidents account for 14% of emergency accidental hospital admissions, whereas home accidents account for 28%; 8% occur in school, and 6% on sports or athletics grounds, farm accidents account for less than 1% of emergency hospital admissions (35% occur in unspecified locations). About half of accidents in children under the age of 5 years occur in the home. Boys are more likely to have accidents than girls. "
pediatrics,828,A 4-year-old girl is found to have bounding pulse and continuous machinery murmur. What is the most probable diagnosis?,TOF (tetralogy of Fallot),ASD (atrial septal defect),VSD (ventricular septal defect),PDA (patent ductus arteriosus),CoA (coarctation of aorta),D,"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a medical condition in which the ductus arteriosus fails to close after birth: this allows a portion of oxygenated blood from the left heart to flow back to the lungs by flowing from the aorta, which has a higher pressure, to the pulmonary artery.Continuousmechinary murmur is well known feature of PDA. Other features are bounding pulse, widened pulse pressure, increased cardiac output, differential cyanosis (cyanosis of the lower extremities but not of the upper body)"
pediatrics,829,"The mother of a 4-year-old child is concerned that her child is developing slowly. During the developmental assessment you note that the child's maximum capability is to build a tower of seven blocks, she is also able to talk, but only in sentences of four to five words. Typically, at which age would you expect to see these developmental milestones in a healthy child?",18 months,24 months,2 ½ years,3 years,4 years,C,"This child would appear to be suffering with a degree of developmental delay. At the age of 4, a child should be able to speak in full sentences and know their own name and age. They should be playing interactively and be able at least to build a bridge with building blocks and possibly steps. There are many causes of developmental delay in children including:  neurological and neurodevelopmental problems such as epilepsy and cerebral palsy physical and psychological needs not being met sensory impairment genetic, such as Down's syndrome, and ill health.

pediatrics,830,"A female infant presents with impaired vision at 4 months of age. She was born at 25+2/40 weighing 0.59 kg. She required vigorous resuscitation, and had a stormy neonatal course. She is ventilated for 14 days, and remains in oxygen for the first three months of life. She requires inotropes for 4 days to maintain BP. She has bilateral grade 4 intraventricular haemorrhages. Immunisations up to date. No family or social history of note. On examination she has plagiocephaly and an OFC on the 97%, with weight below the 3%. She has cutaneous scars at drip sites. She has leucocoria in the right eye and a persistent convergent squint. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Amblyopia,Congenital cataract,Glaucoma,Hypermetropia,Retinopathy of prematurity,E,"The history suggests impaired vision with retinal detachment following retinopathy of prematurity caused by the stormy neonatal course. ROP is staged by location and severity. Location:  Zone 1 - retina around the optic disc Zone 2 - middle Zone 3 - periphery of retina.  Severity ranged from stages 1-5, with + to indicate neovascularisation. Neonatal screening programs should be in place in all neonatal units. Treatment (stage 3 upwards) is with laser therapy."
pediatrics,831,A 9-month-old black infant is brought to the emergency room by her parents saying that she fell off her high chair and onto her head while trying to reach for a toy which she dropped. Choose from the following options the suggestive feature of non-accidental injury in this child.,Bruising on her temporal parietal region,Irritability,Retinal haemorrhages,Scalds on the dorsum of both hands,Subdural haematoma,D,"Scalds on the dorsum of the hand is characteristic of non-accidental injury, unlike scalds on the palm which may occur if the infant is unattended and holds items such as cups hot enough to cause scalding. Scalds of the buttocks and both feet are also suggestive of non-accidental injury. Bruising on the parieto-temporal region, retinal haemorrhages, subdural haematoma, and irritability could occur with the type of fall described in the question."

pediatrics,833,"You admit a 5-year-old girl with a 10 day history of fevers, increased difficulty in breathing, and 'fruity cough', which is worsening despite 5 days of oral amoxicillin. A CXR and ultrasound confirm a right-sided empyema. As a team you decide to insert a chest drain and initiate fibrinolysis. You are asked to insert the chest drain. Where will the chest drain be placed?",Two finger breadths below the axillary skin crease in the anterior axillary line and aim the tube inferiorly,"Third intercostal space, posterior axillary line and aim the tube inferiorly","Fifth intercostal space, mid-axillary line and aim the tube inferiorly","Sixth intercostal space, anterior axillary line and aim the tube superiorly","Sixth intercostal space, posterior axillary line and aim the tube inferiorly",C,"Before chest drain insertion you should check full blood count, urea and electrolytes, clotting, and ensure a Gandamp;S is available. Any coagulopathy or platelet defect should be corrected before insertion. Consent should be taken. In children, chest drain insertion is generally undertaken under general anaesthetic. An aseptic technique should be used. The patient should be positioned with the affected side uppermost, lying at 45 degrees, with the arm raised behind their head to expose the axillary area. The chest drain should be inserted into the fifth intercostal space, mid-axillary line - the 'safe triangle'. It is bordered by the latissimus dorsi posteriorly, the pectoralis major anteriorly, a line superior to the horizontal level of the nipple inferiorly (fifth intercostal space), and the base of the axilla. It is important to note that specific positioning of the chest drain at an alternative site may be required for loculated effusions. In this circumstance, a radiologist can mark the site for insertion prior to the procedure or be present in theatre to guide optimal positioning and safe insertion. If marked by a radiologist prior to theatre, ensure that the patient is in the same position during the marking and the subsequent chest drain insertion. Following insertion, the chest drain should be attached to an underwater seal. A CXR should be undertaken to check positioning. The underwater seal should be checked to ensure it oscillates during respiration. Parents and nursing staff should be advised not to lift the underwater bottle above the level of the insertion site, to ensure the bottle is kept upright and the tubing is not compressed or kinked.

Heterophil antibody tests are usually positive. Mild transient thrombocytopaenia is not uncommon in EBV infectious mononucleosis. CMV mononucleosis has a lower incidence of pharyngitis and cervical adenopathy. Primary toxoplasmosis is acquired via ingestion of undercooked meat containing toxoplasma cysts or ingestion of fresh food contaminated by toxoplasma excreted in cats' faeces. The infection is asymptomatic in 80-90% of immunocompetent patients. Highly characteristic of toxoplasmosis is asymmetrical lymphadenopathy limited to an isolated lymph node group. Patients with toxoplasmosis have little or no fever, fatigue, or pharyngitis. CMV infectious mononucleosis may be indistinguishable in clinical presentation from EBV but is usually not accompanied by posterior cervical adenopathy; non-exudative pharyngitis is minimal or absent. The diagnosis of ALL and HD is made by a combination of blood film examination, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy and lymph node biopsy."
pediatrics,835,"Which of the following indicates a functional, rather than organic, cause of abdominal pain in young children?",Left iliac fossa pain,Loose stools,Pain that wakes the patient at night,Poor school attendance,Recent viral illness,D,"Poor school attendance is commonly associated with functional abdominal pain in children. Change in bowel habit along with abdominal pain is associated with multiple abdominal pathologies. Mesenteric adenitis is usually preceded by a viral illness. Left iliac fossa pain is associated with gastroenteritis, severe constipation, and occasionally abnormal presentation for appendicitis. Pain that truly wakes the patient at night is never functional."

Iron deficiency anaemia and gastrointestinal bleeding would not cause hepatosplenomegaly. Chloramphenicol toxicity would cause complete bone marrow suppression. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency would cause episodes of haemolysis, that is, jaundice, abdominal pain and dark urine."
pediatrics,838,You are in a nutrition clinic reviewing a 15-year-old girl with anorexia nervosa. She has a BMI of 15.5 kg/m^2 and her weight is 70% the expected weight for height. How would you categorise her degree of malnutrition?,Mild undernutrition,Moderate undernutrition,Normal weight,Overweight,Severe undernutrition,E,"Malnutrition is a clinical situation where an imbalance in energy, protein or other components of the diet causes measurable adverse effects upon the health of the body. Technically, malnutrition includes:  Undernutrition Overnutrition, and Vitamin and mineral deficiencies.  There are many different grading systems in use throughout the world to classify severity of undernutrition. However, a weight of less than70-75% of expected weight for age and a BMI less than16 kg/m^2 are consistent with severe undermutrition. A scale commonly used to grade the severity of protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) is shown below:      % Expected Weight for Age BMI (kg/m^2)   Normal weight 90-110% 19-24   Mild undernutrition 85-90% 18-18.9   Moderate undernutrition 75-85% 16-17.9   Severe undernutrition less than75% less than16"
pediatrics,839,Which of the following is true of Gilbert's syndrome?,Inheritance is usually autosomal dominant,Serum bilirubin levels are decreased by fasting,Serum bilirubin levels are decreased by liver enzyme inducers,Serum conjugated bilirubin levels are elevated,There is bilirubinuria,C,"Gilbert's syndrome is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and affects 2-5% of the population. The mutation in this instance is in the promoter region of the gene and leads to lower enzyme levels, penetrance is incomplete (not all individuals homozygous for the mutation have Gilbert's). A missense mutation in the UDPGT gene can give rise to Gilbert's. In this case inheritance appears to be autosomal dominant. This mutation is substantially less common than that occurring in the promoter region and appears to have been described predominantly in those of Asian descent. In both cases UDP glucuronyl transferase levels are reduced leading to an unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. Whilst serum bilirubin levels are elevated the other LFT's are normal. Jaundice deepens after a period of fasting or intercurrent illness but bilirubin levels are reduced by enzyme inducers such as phenobarbitone. As unconjugated bilirubin is tightly bound to albumin it cannot cross the glomerulus and is therefore not found in the urine. This contrasts with the bilirubin-glucuronide-albumin complex formed in patients with cholestatic jaundice (and raised conjugated bilirubin levels) where 1% of the complex is dialysable and although most of the bilirubin is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule some bilirubin is detectable in the urine.

pediatrics,840,"At 38 weeks gestation a 2.8 kg infant is born to a healthy Caucasian mother. She smokes 20 cigarettes per day. Type 2 decelerations were noted on the CTG in late stage 1, so delivery was by emergency Caesarian section. At delivery Apgars were 1 at 1 minute, and 2 at 5 minutes. She was given thumb and mask (T-piece) ventilation with 100% oxygen and external cardiac massage. Initial investigations showed a pH of 6.95 BE-15.7, and glucose of 1.2 mmol/L on BM stix testing. She was intubated, ventilated and given 3 ml/kg of 10% dextrose. Over the next few hours she remained floppy, and developed lip-smacking and drops in saturation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Group B Streptococcal Septicaemia,Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy,Meconium aspiration,Septo-optic dysplasia,Surfactant deficient lung disease,B,"The picture is one of hypoxia-ischaemia, with growth retardation and maternal smoking suggesting that this has been prolonged. The degree of acidosis and hypoglycaemia suggests that metabolic reserves have been used up, and that anaerobic glycolysis is marked. Subsequent convulsions suggest significant hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, which is clinically divided into 3 stages by Sarnat scoring. Prognostication in individual cases is difficult.   "
pediatrics,841,Which one of the following diseases is caused by an enzyme defect?,Cystic fibrosis,Erythroblastosis foetalis,Fragile X syndrome,Haemophilia,Phenylketonuria,E,Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene (CFTR). Erythroblastosis fetalis is caused by Rh incompatibility. Fragile X occurs due to the absence of a specific protein called 'Fragile X mental retardation protein'. Haemophilia is caused by defective genes encoding coagulation factors. Phenylketonuria is caused by absence of phenylalanine hydroxylase.
pediatrics,842,"A 7-day-old boy presents to accident and emergency with a one-day history of poor feeding, decreased activity, and mild fever. Examination reveals an ill-looking, lethargic baby with mild signs of dehydration and nothing else of note.

This is especially true in the paediatric population (particularly the neonatal group) where there are very limited clinical signs to rule in or rule out meningitis. The presence of a high number of red blood cells indicates either a traumatic tap, or haemorrhagic encephalitis seen with herpes simplex encephalitis. However, the latter can be ruled out by the neutrophilia rather than lymphocytosis. Special considerations should be taken in traumatic CSF analysis; in the peripheral blood count, the white:red cell ratio in this patient is about 1:400 (12×10^9:5.0×10^12) whereas in the CSF, it is about 1:7 (1100:7621). Therefore, it is evident that the WBCs in the CSF are not only because of the traumatic tap. As long as the WBCs are mainly neutrophils, bacterial meningitis is the most likely diagnosis."
pediatrics,843,"A 5-year-old girl presents with vomiting and diarrhoea. This began two days ago. The vomiting is now settling, but the diarrhoea has contained admixed blood and some slime. She was a healthy term infant, with no previous medical problems, nor adverse FH/SH. On examination she has a temperature of 38.6°C and is quiet. She has a dry mouth and reduced skin turgor. Respiratory rate is 25/min and heart rate 100/min. No rash. Her peripheries are cool and capillary refill time four seconds.

pediatrics,845,A 16-year-old girl presents with a two day history of deteriorating breathlessness and dyspnoea. Blood gas analysis on admission shows:    pH 7.25 (7.35-7.45)   PCO2 7.0 kPa (4.7-6.0)   PO2 8.5 kPa (9.3-13.3)   base excess −4 mmol (−3 to +3)    Which of the following interpretations is correct?,Bicarbonate may be necessary to correct the acidosis,Blood gases suggest type 1 respiratory failure,Immediate intubation is required,Results are consistent with bronchopulmonary dysplasia,Results are consistent with late severe asthma,E,"In interpreting blood gas results, the following sequence may be useful:  Inspect the pH: Is it low, normal or high? Inspect the CO2: Is it low, normal or high? Inspect the PO2: Is it low, normal or high?  If the pH is low then an acidosis is present, and inspecting the CO2 will enable you to determine whether this is due to respiratory or metabolic causes. Inspecting the PO2 will tell you whether the patient is hypoxic or not. In this case, the pH is reduced, and the CO2 is high, with a base deficit of only −4, insufficient to explain the acidosis from metabolic causes. This is, therefore, a respiratory acidosis, and the PO2 is also low suggesting type 2 respiratory failure. Possible causes would include severe pneumonia, end stage asthma or neurogenic causes such as Guillain-Barre. In asthma, the initial stages show a low CO2, with this climbing only to accompany failing respiration. The results would therefore be consistent with late severe asthma. There are high risks associated with intubation and ventilation of asthmatics, due to the high pressures required. Intensive therapy (incl. IV aminophylline or salbutamol and Magnesium) would precede this. In bronchopulmonary dysplasia, there is usually long-term CO2 retention with compensatory increase in bicarbonate leading to a positive base excess and normal pH. Bicarbonate is usually only considered if the base deficit exceeds about −8. "

He has a prominent forehead with 'sun-setting' of his eyes and dilated veins over his scalp. He has bilateral blurring of the optic discs. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral abscess,Hydrocephalus,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Leigh disease,Medulloblastoma,B,"The headache, head enlargement, sun-setting, and dilated veins and papilloedema all point to hydrocephalus. 'Sun-setting' is because of impingement of the dilated suprapineal recess on the tectum."

Hereditary spherocytosis and neurofibromatosis are autosomal dominant. Von Willebrand's disease is mostly inherited in a dominant fashion, but recent case reports suggest some forms of the disease are autosomal recessive. Idiopathic thrombocytopenia is not a genetic disorder."
pediatrics,849,"A 2-year-old girl presents with a raised itchy rash. She had been eating a chocolate bar when she spat it out saying it hurt her mouth. Within minutes the rash had appeared over her face and trunk. She was 39+1/40, weighing 3.25 kg, and there were no neonatal problems apart from cradle cap. She has been fully immunised to date. There is a family history of asthma. On examination she has a florid raised rash over her face. Some of the lesions are coalescing. She is scratching, but breathing and tongue size are normal. Her temperature is 36.9°C (tympanic), respiratory rate 30/min, and heart rate of 100/min. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Atopic dermatitis,Contact dermatitis,Impetigo,Scabies,Urticaria,E,The history suggests an urticarial reaction to one of the components of the chocolate bar. Manufactured foods make it difficult to identify the offending substance. Treatment is with antihistamines when required (pro re nata or PRN) and avoidance of known precipitants.
pediatrics,850,You agree to take part in studies of a new antiviral for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infections in children aged 4-12 years. You have a 12-year-old patient who is suitable to enter the study.

At the age of 12, this patient should have a good understanding of the issues involved in the clinical trial; whilst she cannot give consent alone, both the patient and her parents should agree to taking part in the study. Patients who consent to take part in a clinical study may withdraw at any time, although every effort should be made to follow them up if possible."
pediatrics,851,Which one of the following options would not be expected in association with poorly controlled hypothyroidism in an 18-month-old infant?,Delayed bone age,Delayed development milestones,Diarrhoea,High plasma TSH concentration,Umbilical hernia,C,High plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration with low free thyroxine level would occur. Thyroid hormone is a prerequisite for normal growth and cognitive/psychomotor development so bone age and developmental milestones would be delayed. Umbilical herniae are a feature. Constipation is a feature rather than diarrhoea.
pediatrics,852,A 16-year-old girl presents with repeated shoulder joint subluxation. She bruises easily but has no abnormal skin hyperextensibility. She can extend both of her elbows and knees beyond 10 degrees and touch the flats of her hands to the floor without bending her knees. She has no family history and normal body proportions. What is the likely diagnosis?,Benign joint hypermobility syndrome,Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,Homocystinuria,Marfan's syndrome,Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,A,"Benign joint hypermobility syndrome (type III Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) is diagnosed in the presence of a Beighton score of more than 4, indicating joint hypermobility. The Beighton score is calculated by assigning one point for each of the following nine features:  can extend 5th finger beyond 90 degrees left hand can extend 5th finger beyond 90 degrees right hand can flex right thumb down to volar aspect of right forearm can flex left thumb down to volar aspect of left forearm can extend left elbow beyond 10 degrees can extend right elbow beyond 10 degrees can extend left knee beyond 10 degrees can extend right knee beyond 10 degrees, and can touch flats of hands to the ground while keeping legs straight.  There should be no evidence of skin/soft-tissue fragility/skin hyperextensibility or vascular or visceral rupture. There are no associated ocular findings. Associations of benign joint hypermobility syndrome include:  easy bruising irritable bowel syndrome back pain urinary frequency dental crowding, and recurrent joint subluxation.  Chronic pain, osteoarthritis, and osteopenia may occur. Fatigue and migraine are common. It may be transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait. Classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, also known as types I and II Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, manifests with skin hyperextensibility and poor healing of scars in addition to joint hypermobility. It is autosomal dominant with mutations in COL5A1 or COL5A2. In vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type IV) there is rupture of hollow organs and vasculature. It is autosomal dominant due to mutations in COL3A1. In homocystinuria, children are tall with dislocated ocular lenses and learning difficulties. Marfan's syndrome is incorrect in this case because the individual does not have a Marfanoid body habitus or features of Marfan's syndrome, such as aortic root dilation. Marfan's syndrome is autosomal dominant due to mutations in FBN1 gene."
pediatrics,853,"A 5-month-old boy presents with florid red rash over his scalp, nappy area and trunk. Despite this he seems well in himself and feeding well.

pediatrics,854,A routine ultrasound at 18 weeks' gestation in a diabetic mother reveals a male fetus with an endocardial cushion defect. Other abnormalities include increased nuchal thickening and a 'double bubble' sign. Which of the following conditions is most likely to have contributed to this set of findings?,Congenital syphilis,Marfan's syndrome,Maternal folate deficiency,Maternal use of ACE inhibitor,Trisomy 21,E,"Diabetic mothers are more likely to have children with congenital abnormalities depending on preconception, and first trimester blood sugar control. Forty percent of Down's syndrome babies have atrioventricular septal defects, as in this fetus. The double bubble sign suggests duodenal atresia, which again suggests Down's syndrome.

She noticed this discharge today after having soreness and irritation with itchiness for the past two days. A past medical history of type 1 diabetes and smoking (10 cigarettes per day) is noted. In addition, she is on oral contraceptives as she admitted having unprotected sex during the previous week. Clinical examination revealed vulvar erythema with thick and adherent cottage cheese-like discharge. Recent HbA1c was 93.4 mmol/mol. What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",Clindamycin intravaginal cream,Local emollient,Oestrogen therapy,Oral fluconazole,Oral metronidazole,D,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis is not uncommon, especially in uncontrolled diabetics. The diagnosis is almost always clinical, provided a good history is taken. Vaginal candidiasis is not considered an opportunistic infection because it can happen in healthy individuals without risk factors such as diabetes. In addition, it is not considered a sexually transmitted disease. In this patient, there are several indicators of vaginal candidiasis, which include irritation, vulvar erythema, and cottage cheese-like discharge. These symptoms do overlap with other aetiologies; these can be excluded by the strong history consistent with candidiasis (diabetes and smoking). Metronidazole and clindamycin are used in bacterial vaginosis, while oestrogen therapy is used for atrophic vaginitis. Local emollients can be used in all cases of vaginal irritation as a reliever, but not for treatment. "
pediatrics,856,A 6 weeks formula fed baby boy is found at the child health surveillance to be deeply jaundiced. His weight gain is poor and his stools are pale. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Galactosemia,Biliary atresia,G6PD deficiency,Rh incompatibility,Congenital viral infection,B,Deep jaundice at 6th week with pale stools suggests obstructive jaundice. So most likely diagnosis here is biliary atresia
pediatrics,857,You are a GP who has noted an increase in accidents in children attending your practice and want to find out where children are most at risk. What is the most common cause of accidental injury in 1-15-year-olds?,Drowning,Falls,Fire and flames,Poisoning,Road traffic accidents,B,"After infancy, accidental injury is the main cause of death in children in the United Kingdom. Socioeconomic inequalities in accidental death and injury remain very marked, despite the absolute rates of death from injury falling over the last few decades. For example, the children of parents who have never worked are 13 times more likely to die from unintentional injury and 37 times more likely to die from exposure to smoke, fire or flames. Injury is also the most common cause of physical disability in young adults. Falls are the most common cause of accidental injury to children, and account for 44% of injuries. Simple interventions and supervision can greatly reduce falls. Whilst transport-related deaths account for a larger proportion of deaths, the morbidity from other forms of injury is greater. "
pediatrics,858,"A 17-year-old girl presents following an overdose of paracetamol, her parents having found her with empty packets of paracetamol. She states that she has taken 10 tablets, three hours earlier. Which is the most appropriate step in this patient's management?",Administer oral activated charcoal 50 g,Give N-Acetylcysteine intravenously,Measure plasma paracetamol concentration at 4 hours after ingestion,Transfer to young person's psychiatric unit immediately,Take no immediate action,C,"Current guidance suggests that this patient should have blood paracetamol levels (plus U+E, LFT, bicarbonate, FBC, INR) taken at 4 hours. Her level should be measured against the risk algorithm (available in the BNF for Children and on Toxbase). Consider administration of activated charcoal if more than 150 mg/kg paracetamol has been taken within 1 hour of presentation to hospital. "
pediatrics,859,A mother is worried as she has noticed a small superficial strawberry birth mark develop on her 3-week-old son's neck. She asks the health visitor for advice and she confirms that it is a capillary haemangioma. What would be the appropriate advice?,As it may grow he should have it lasered immediately,As it is unsightly he should be given a course of propranolol to take for two weeks to reduce its size,Capillary haemangiomas are benign and there is never any indication for treatment,"It will get bigger until he is about 6 months of age, then start to involute and will probably disappear during early childhood",He should have further ultrasound examination to ensure that he does not have any internally that may cause problems,D,"Approximately 30% of haemangiomas are visible at birth, the rest become visible 1-4 weeks after birth. They are more common in females, Caucasians and low birthweight babies. Aetiology is unknown. Eighty three per cent occur on the head and neck, the rest internally and externally over the rest of the body. Haemangiomas that grow internally can be very dangerous. They can be life threatening or interfere with eating, breathing, seeing, hearing, speaking, etc and may require immediate aggressive intervention. They are difficult to detect and when they are detected the infant is often in need of immediate intervention. Internal haemangiomas occur in the liver, intestines, airway and brain. When an infant has multiple haemangiomas, particularly if deep (cavernous), mixed, or large (segmental) an ultrasound (or MRI) should be considered to rule out internal lesions. Jaundice may be a sign of liver haemangiomas, blood in the stool may be a sign of haemangiomas on the intestines and stridor (croupy cough and difficulty breathing) may be a sign of airway haemangiomas. Haemangiomas can grow for up to 18 months and then begin to involute over 3-10 years. If they are causing no problem they do not require laser treatment. Propanolol can be given to reduce the size of haemangiomas but close monitoring would be required in a hospital environment. "
pediatrics,860,"A 5-year-old child presents to the clinic for evaluation of fever associated with a rash. Examination of the child reveals an ill boy with a temperature of 39°C. The rash is diffuse, erythematous, maculopapular, which blanches on pressure. The mother says that there is no cough and that the rash is predominant in the axillae and groin. The oropharynx is erythematous. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Erythema multiforme,Group A streptococcal infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Roseola infantum,Measles,B,"This patient has clinical features suggestive of those usually caused by group A streptococcus. The erythema in the skin folds are referred to as Pastia's lines. Sore throat without cough, fever and maculopapular rash in this distribution is characteristic. Treatment is with penicillin for 10 days or erythromycin if penicillin allergic. Erythema multiforme rash may also become confluent, but patients usually present with discrete lesions. They may be red papules or urticarial lesions with central erythema and a rim of pallor (target lesions), or there may be vesicles or bullae. Involvement of mucous membranes in association with the rash of erythema multiforme characterises Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Roseola infantum is characterised by high fever for several days with no source of infection, followed by abrupt resolution of fever and the appearance of maculopapular rash. Roseola infantum is caused by human herpes virus 6. Measles is associated with 3 Cs:  cough coryza, and conjunctivitis.  There is also a fever and a maculopapular rash which becomes confluent which is different from the one described above. Infectious mononucleosis infection is caused by Epstein-Barr virus and is characterised by fever, cough, palatal petechiae and a maculopapaular rash following administration of ampicillin. Palatal petechaie and haemorrhagic macules on the palate and the tonsils are not exclusively found in infectious mononucleosis. Splenomegally may also be present and genereralised lymphadenopathy. The characteristic rash does not follow Pastia's lines"
pediatrics,861,"A 3-year-old girl presents to her general practitioner with a new generalised papular rash. On further questioning she had a four day history of high fever, malaise, conjunctivitis and a mild cough during the last week. Examination reveals white punctate lesions on the buccal mucosa. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chickenpox,Erythema infectiosum,Infectious mononucleosis,Measles,Rubella,D,"The measles prodrome typically consists of high fever, malaise, cough, conjunctivitis and coryza. The white punctate lesions of the buccal mucosa are Koplik spots. The rash starts on the face and upper neck and spreads to the extremities. These are pathognomonic for measles; they often fade as the macular rash starts."
pediatrics,862,"You see a 12-year-old boy in the Emergency department who is attending with his concerned parents. He has a four hour history of an exquisitely tender left testicle with pain radiating towards the umbilicus, and also describes a sensation of nausea. His testis is of normal size but is extremely tender. You inform the registrar who is scrubbed in theatre. He explains he will be an hour and asks you to follow the department protocol. What is the most appropriate plan of action?",Administer antibiotics after collecting a urine specimen,Arrange a testicular ultrasound,Prepare the patient for testicular exploration and bilateral orchidopexy and inform theatres,Reassure the patient and his parents that this is probably due to a virus,Submit a referral to Urology,C,Torsion is a urological emergency and delay beyond six hours is associated with an increased risk of testicular ischaemia. All patients with a history suggestive of torsion should be booked without delay for exploration of the painful testis followed by three point orchidopexy of the reduced testis and prophylactic pexy of the normal testis.
pediatrics,863,"An 8-year-old boy develops generalized edema with proteinuria of 4.8 gm/24 hours, hypoproteinaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. He is started on steroids and improves. Which of the following statements are true, regarding this condition?",Complete resolution is seen in all cases following a course of steroids,Ninety percent of steroid responders have no relapses.,Ninety percent of patients respond to first course of steroids,Recurrence in 20% of cases with gradual resistance to steroids,Steroids have no effect on mortality,C,"This patient has nephrotic syndrome. Suggestive features are usually:  oedema proteinuria (of more than 4 g/24h), and hypoproteinaemia with or without hypercholesterolaemia.  In 90% the cause is unknown, histology usually points minimal change glomerulonephritis as the cause. Most children with nephrotic syndrome respond to corticosteroids, but many experience a relapsing course with recurrent oedema and proteinuria. Corticosteroids reduce mortality to approximately 3%. Ninety percent respond in eight weeks. Approximately 30% of responders have no relapse. Ten to twenty percent of these are cured after four or less courses of steroids. The rest may become dependent on steroids."

pediatrics,865,"A 4-year-old boy who is of short stature, obese and has hypogonadism is referred to the genetics clinic with a suspected diagnosis of Prader-Willi syndrome. Which one test would be most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",Dietician assessment,Fluorescent in situ hybridisation,Methylation-based polymerase chain reaction,Sex chromosome analysis of father,Trial of human growth hormone,C,"Prader-Willi syndrome is a result of the absence of 11-13q on paternal chromosom 15. Certain genes in this region are normally suppressed on the maternal chromosome, so, for normal development to occur, they must be expressed on the paternal chromosome. Sufferers have 'no active paternal Prader-Willi gene'. Either uniparental disomy - inherited both chromosomes 15 from mother or new mutation in chromosome 15 that was inherited from father. Prader-Willi syndrome should be suspected in any infant born with significant hypotonia (muscle weakness or andquot;floppinessandquot;). Clinical features include:  Narrow forehead Hypotonia and feeding difficulties in infancy Almond shaped eyes Narrow nasal bridge Thin upper lip, carp shaped mouth, micrognathia Small hands and feet Clinodatyly, syndactyly Scoliosis Short stature Mental retardation Obesity and insatiable appetite Emotional lability Hypogonadism (micropenis, hypoplastic scotum, cryptorchidism) Delayed menarche in girls Diabetes, and Life expectancy reduced due to obesity.  The diagnosis is confirmed by methylation analysis, which is a type of polymerase chain reaction test and detects greater than99% of cases, including all of the major genetic subtypes of Prader-Willi (deletion, uniparental disomy, imprinting mutation). A FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridisation) test will identify those patients with PWS due to a deletion, but will not identify those who have Prader-Willi syndrome by uniparental disomy or via an imprinting error. While HGH is effective in increasing height as well as decreasing body fat, increasing muscle mass, improving weight distribution and increasing bone mineral density in patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, it is also very effective in other conditions such as Turner syndrome or severe idiopathic short stature so would help support but not confirm the diagnosis. Dietary assessment may help to control obesity along with other measures in Prader-Willi, but does not help confirm diagnosis. Sex chromosome analysis would not help, as the syndrome is caused by a deletion/disruption of genes or maternal disomy in the proximal arm of chromosome 15. "
pediatrics,866,"You see a boy of 5 in clinic, he has polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). He has been on NSAIDS and has had methotrexate with poor response. He is going to start treatment with the anti TNF- drug etanercept. His parents want to know how this will be administered. What is the recommended treatment regimen for etanercept in children?",Daily intramuscular injection,Monthly intravenous infusion,Monthly subcutaneous injection,Twice weekly subcutaneous injection,Weekly intramuscular injection,D,"Etanercept is recommended for children aged 4 to 17 years with active polyarticular-course juvenile idiopathic arthritis whose condition has not responded adequately to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. It is given as a twice weekly subcutaneous injection. Etanercept is a recombinant human TNF receptor fusion protein that acts competitively to inhibit the binding of TNF to its cell-surface receptor. Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) is a pro-inflammatory mediator that has been identified as a key molecule in the pathogenesis of JIA. Its over-expression is responsible for the damaging inflammatory processes that occur in articular cartilage and bone. Agents that inhibit the action of TNFα might therefore be expected to have the potential to modify the inflammatory processes of rheumatic disease. Initiation of etanercept therapy should only be undertaken by a consultant who regularly sees children and young people with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and who runs specialised paediatric rheumatology clinics.

pediatrics,867,Which one of the following statements concerning immunisation is correct?,Immunisation is contraindicated in a baby with Down syndrome and congenital heart disease,In premature babies timing of the first course should be postpones until three months from expected date of delivery,Hib vaccination provides protection against all strains of haemophilus influenza,"The pediacel vaccine (combined diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, haemophilus, polio) is particularly contraindicated in a baby with diarrhoea","The pediacel vaccine (combined diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, haemophilus, polio) may be given to siblings of immunosuppressed children",E,"The immunisation schedule should proceed normally. Immunisation is not contraindicated in cases of congenital heart disease. Premature babies should receive the vaccinations at the usual time and not be corrected for gestational age. In addition rotavirus and influenza vaccinations are also recommended. For further details see the NHS quick guide to childhood immunisations for the parents of premature babies. The pediacel vaccination is a combined vaccination consisting of Diphtheria and Tetanus Toxoids and Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed Combined with Inactivated Poliomyelitis Vaccine and Haemophilus b Conjugate Vaccine (Tetanus Protein - Conjugate). There are no live strains within the injection. Live vaccines are particularly contraindicated if vomiting and diarrhoea are present because some of the vaccine may be excreted in the faeces and hence spread to immunosuppressed children. It is particularly important to vaccinate the siblings of immunosuppressed children, to help prevent them coming into contact with diseases. Vaccines that contain Hib antigen do not provide protection against infections with other types of H. influenzae or against meningitis of other origin."
pediatrics,868,A 10-year-old girl from the Indian subcontinent presents with pallor and mild jaundice. She has frontal bossing and maxillary overgrowth. She has multiple small scars on her abdomen. On palpation of her abdomen she is noted to have hepatosplenomegaly.  Given the likely diagnosis what is the mode of inheritance?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Sporadic,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,B,"Given the history and examination findings as well as the ethnicity of the patient it is most likely that the patient has beta thalassaemia. The condition is usually inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Autosomal recessive conditions will give rise to an affected (homozygote) individual from two carrier (heterozygote) parents. This means the condition can occur completely unexpectedly.  Consanguineous relations are more likely to give rise to affected individuals, as although the abnormal genes are rare they are more likely to occur in a gene pool of the same families. The male to female ratio is 1:1 and if both parents are carriers than ½ of the offspring will be carriers, ¼ will be affected and ¼ will be normal."
pediatrics,869,"A 2-year-old boy presents with convergent squint. Mother is concerned about his vision. He was born prematurely at 32/40 weighing 1.7 kg, but had a smooth neonatal course. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he looks well and thriving. He has a marked convergent squint, which varies with direction of gaze. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital cataract,Glaucoma,Hypermetropia,Myopia,Retinopathy of prematurity,C,"This child requires urgent evaluation by an ophthalmologist to exclude a refractive error, most likely hypermetropia (hyperopia). The cross-eyed look worsens with accommodation, as the child attempts to correct the refractive error. Failure to correct this can quickly result in amblyopia (suppression of the image in one eye), with permanent damage. Ex-prems have an increased incidence of refractive errors.   "
pediatrics,870,"A 3-year-old boy known to have eczema presents with a two day history of increased itchiness and eczematous rash over his face, hands, and knees. He has always had small areas of dry skin and eczema but this recently started preventing him from sleep. There is no past history of note and the parents are using emollients regularly as prescribed. Other than the clinical eczematous rash, clinical exam did not reveal anything of note. What is the next step in the management plan?",A single dose of IM dexamethasone followed by a topical steroid cream,Local antihistamine,Oral antihistamine,Refer to a dermatologist for phototherapy,Topical steroid cream,E,"Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is a chronic, inflammatory, itchy skin condition that usually develops in early childhood. It is typically an episodic disease of exacerbation consisting of flares, which may occur two or three times per month, and remissions, but in some children it is continuous. NICE has made a comprehensive guideline to insure that the optimal management is given to patients with atopic eczema. This guideline is endorsed by the RCPCH. The clinical history of this patient indicate that he has a mild form of eczema. Two days ago, she started having a flare-up. The first step in managing flare-up for mild eczema is by using mildly potent topical steroids. Antihistamines have no role in managing eczema in recent guidelines. However, they can be used when the flare-up is clearly caused by an allergen. Phototherapy is used for severe forms of eczema."
pediatrics,871,"While on call as the paediatric registrar you are called to the delivery of a preterm neonate at 36/40, 2.6 kg with an antenatal diagnosis of gastroschisis. Following an uneventful vaginal delivery the midwife passes the baby to you. In addition to routine resuscitation procedures, what specific initial management should you undertake regarding the gastroschisis?","Paralyse, intubate, and ventilate at birth to minimise the amount of air being swallowed into the bowel, which can compromise bowel reduction. Call the paediatric surgeons when on NICU.","Paralyse, intubate, and ventilate at birth to minimise the amount of air being swallowed into the bowel, which can compromise bowel reduction. Wrap the bowel relatively tightly to the abdominal wall with cling film to keep it warm and minimise heat and fluid losses.",Resuscitate as normal and only undertake intubation and ventilation if required from a respiratory perspective. Call the paediatric surgeons to the delivery room to manage the bowel.,Resuscitate as normal and only undertake intubation and ventilation if required from a respiratory perspective. Do not put anything on the bowel because wrapping it could compromise the blood supply leading to bowel ischaemia.,Resuscitate as normal and only undertake intubation and ventilation if required from a respiratory perspective. NG tube on free drainage with regular aspiration. Wrap the bowel in cling film until paediatric surgery review on NICU.,E,"Gastroschisis is a defect in the anterior abdominal wall, to the right of the umbilicus, through which the exposed bowel is prolapsed. Different diagnoses are:  Hernia of the umbilical cord - small defect at the umbilicus where there is herniation of the intra-abdominal contents into the umbilical cord Exomphalos minor where there is a defect at the umbilicus, less than5 cm in diameter, with herniation of intra-abdominal contents covered by a sac Exomphalos major where there is a defect at the umbilicus, greater than5 cm in diameter, with herniation of intra-abdominal contents covered by a sac. It often contains the liver, bowel, +/- other organs and is associated with other anomalies in up to 50% cases.  Gastroschisis is normally diagnosed antenatally. It is not commonly associated with other anomalies and hence generally has a good survival with minimal morbidity once the bowel has been returned to the abdominal cavity and has started to function. There is no advantage to caesarean delivery. Gastroschisis is associated with spontaneous preterm delivery. Most centres recommend induction at about 38/40 if not in spontaneous labour. Women and fetuses should be monitored regularly and managed at a centre with tertiary paediatric surgery. Once delivered, resuscitation should be undertaken according to the infant's cardiorespiratory requirements; compulsory intubation and ventilation is not required for the bowel management. An NG tube should be inserted, aspirated regularly, and kept on free drainage with mL for mL IV replacement of losses. The baby should be kept NBM with maintenance IVF. The bowel should be wrapped in cling film ensuring that the bowel is not twisted (volvulus cutting off the blood supply) or too tight, which could compromise perfusion. The paediatric surgery team should be called to assess the patient once on the NICU. Surgical options include:  Primary fascial closure under general anaesthetic Reduction of bowel contents on the NICU with primary closure on the unit Staged closure with a surgical silo, performed over approximately 7 days under general anaesthetics Delayed closure with a preformed silo applied at the cot side with closure on the NICU or under general anaesthetic after approximately 4-7 days.  Regardless of the surgical management, acquisition of intestinal peristalsis is delayed and neonates typically do not tolerate enteral intake for a few days to weeks. Average time to full enteral nutrition is 25 days. Parental nutrition is required until this is achieved. "

pediatrics,873,"A 2-day-old baby presents with a history of decreased activity, poor oral intake, and strange movements in the right upper limb. The baby was born at term with no significant perinatal history, to a 28-year-old mother who is on phenytoin. He is breast feeding only. On examination you note a decrease in normal spontaneous movements, and a firm lump over his cranium measuring 3-4 cm in diameter left to the sagittal suture. Soon after examination you note an abnormal seizure-like movement of his right upper limb without loss of consciousness.

The major risk factor in this patient is the maternal ingestion of anticonvulsants. It is a curable condition with vitamin K injections, but with various prognosis depending on the site and severity of bleeding. Vitamin K deficiency causes reduced function of the intrinsic and extrinsic clotting pathways, leading to prolonged PTT and PT, respectively. This is clearly demonstrated in this case in addition to the clue from the maternal ingestion of anticonvulsants. With platelet dysfunction, arteriovenous malformation, and opioid withdrawal, there will be normal PT and PTT values. Child abuse is a diagnosis of exclusion that can be suspected if no medical problem was identified. "

A right lobar pneumonia is diagnosed with collapse of both the middle and lower lobes of the right lung. Whilst observing the baby you note that there is diagphragmatic breathing. He also does not appear to move his lower limbs but has some movement of his arms, although this is mainly evident distally and not proximally. Select the most appropriate diagnosis?",Congenital muscular dystrophy,Congenital myotonic dystrophy,Type 1 spinal muscular atrophy,Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy,Type 3 spinal muscular atrophy,C,"The spinal muscular atrophies result from degeneration of the anterior horn cell. They are autosomally recessive with mutations in the SMN gene which is located at chromosome 5q11-13. The manner in which the severity of the condition is determined is unclear. The most severe form is spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (Werdnig-Hoffman disease). These children are never able to sit or walk and death usually occurs by 18 months of age due to respiratory failure or infection. The presentation of these children may be at birth but is often in the first few months of life with either respiratory infections or failure to meet gross motor developmental milestones. Characteristically these children breathe diaphragmatically as the upper cervical motor neurones are spared but the thoracic muscles receiving innervations from thoracic motor neurones are not spared and so do not function. Limb weakness is seen more proximally than distally and is more prominent in the legs rather than the arms. Tongue fasciculation provides an almost definitive diagnosis as this does not occur in any other condition. Type 2 children are able to sit but not walk and their prognosis is dependent on how severely the respiratory muscles are affected.  Type 3 is the mildest form, and these children are able to walk although proximal weakness is often evident. Congenital muscular dystrophy presents at birth with hypotonia, weakness and contractures. Congenital myotonic dystrophy presents at delivery with a baby often being delivered unexpectedly 'flat' and often requiring respiratory support in the first few days of life. They also have hypotonia and facial weakness and often talipes as well."

He is treated with intravenous ampicillin and gentamicin prophylactically. He initially does very well and gradually begins to be weaned off the ventilator, on day 6 of life his UAC is removed and on day 10 of life his UVC is removed and a long line is inserted. On day 20 of life he develops an increasing oxygen requirement and requires higher ventilator pressures, he also develops temperature instability. A CXR shows mild chronic lung disease but no significant consolidation or pneumothorax. His CRP has risen from less than1 mg/L to 80 mg/L. Blood cultures are sent and he is started on second line antibiotics which are flucloxacillin and gentamicin. At 24 hours there has been no improvement in his condition and he is showing an increasing mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis.

Their immune function is immature and they are exposed to multiple sources of infection from the birth canal through to the invasive procedures which are performed on them on a regular basis. Prophylactic antibiotics are commenced in all low birth weight, extremely premature infants irrespective of whether there are risk factors for sepsis. Sepsis may present itself in a subtle manner in these infants with symptoms and signs different from term and older infants. Due to the presence of multiple invasive lines in this infant, appropriate pathogens to consider include skin organisms that often contaminate lines such as Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus. In the case of both of these pathogens resistance to penicillins is increasing worldwide. These infants are also very susceptible to invasive candidiasis, and as such some neonatal units start these infants on prophylactic antifungals at birth. In this case the infant was not given prophylactic antifungal agents and so it would be appropriate to consider the possibility of invasive Candida infection and discussing with the microbiology department whether starting antifungal agents would be appropriate. Burkholderia cepacia is not an organism that is commonly associated with infections in preterm infants and is more commonly associated with children with cystic fibrosis."

He was a term infant of 3.3 kg, is fully immunised and there is no FH/SH of note. On examination he appears thin and wasted with loose buttock folds. He is pale with a distended tympanic abdomen. He is not clubbed, and cardiac and respiratory examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune enteropathy,Coeliac disease,Crohn disease,Post-enteritis enteropathy,Toddler diarrhoea,B,"The history suggests chronic malabsorption and growth failure from 7 months of age, the time at which wheat was introduced. Coeliac disease in the most likely diagnosis. The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive jejunal biopsy plus falling serum IgA endomysial antibody titre in response to a gluten-free diet."
pediatrics,880,You are investigating whether a new antibiotic used in the paediatric population may require dose adjustment in the obese paediatric population. Which of the following pharmacokinetic parameters would give you the biggest clue as to whether dose adjustment is required?,C-max,Half life,T-max,Total dose of the drug in milligrams,Volume of distribution,E,"Whilst the need for dose adjustment is unlikely, it is volume of distribution which may provide the biggest clue as to whether it is required or not. The definition of volume of distribution is, andquot;The apparent volume in which a drug is distributed immediately after it has been injected intravenously and equilibrated between plasma and the surrounding tissuesandquot;. Drugs which have a much larger volume of distribution are ones which are therefore very lipid soluble and undergo rapid re-distribution to tissue after administration. This may be an advantage or disadvantage when it comes to administration of antibiotics, depending on the target tissue. An example of a drug with a low volume of distribution, because it is highly bound to plasma proteins is warfarin. One with a much greater volume of distribution because it is highly lipid soluble is chloroquine. C-max and T-max are related to drug absorption, and should not be significantly altered by obesity. Half life is linked to hepatic function if the drug is extensively liver metabolised, and to rate of excretion. Total dose of the drug in milligrams is largely irrelevant when it comes to the need for dose adjustment."

It is caused by an enzyme deficiency (galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase deficiency is the most common). This will lead to inability to metabolise galactose, which will be excreted in the urine and can be detected as a presence of reducing substances in urine. Such patients are treated only by dietary modification to exclude lactose and galactose. GORD is also possible but it is excluded by the presence of reducing substances. If the diagnosis was pyloric stenosis or renal failure, deranged electrolyte profile and blood gases would be expected. Eosinophilic oesophagitis is suspected when there is a strong history of atopy and confirmed by endoscopy with oesophageal biopsy that will show eosinophilic infiltrates. Galactosaemia is not currently screened for in the UK. "

He had been brought to hospital by ambulance, having collapsed shortly after being stung on the hand by a bee. On examination, his blood pressure was 80/40 mmHg, and facial swelling was noted. Which one of the following investigations is most likely to confirm the nature of the reaction?",Haemolytic complement (CH50) level,Plasma tryptase activity,Serum complement C3 level,Serum total IgE level,Serum venom-specific IgE level,B,"Type I hypersensitivity, also known as immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity, usually takes 15-30 minutes from the time of exposure to the antigen. The reaction may cause a range of symptoms from minor inconvenience to death. The reaction involves preferential production of IgE in response to certain antigens which in turn initiates a sequence of events leading to the release of various pharmacologically active substances that are responsible for the clinical features. Diagnostic tests include skin tests, measurement of total IgE and specific IgE antibodies against the suspected allergens. However, this question asks which of the following tests would provide confirmatory information and that would be tryptase. Tryptase is a neutral protease stored in mast cell secretory granules that is secreted by human mast cells. Levels in normal blood are undetectable (less than 1 ng/mL). Elevated serum levels demonstrate that mast cell activation with mediator release has occurred whether triggered by IgE-mediated anaphylaxis or non-IgE-mediated anaphylactoid reactions. The greater the severity of anaphylaxis, the more likely that serum tryptase levels will be elevated."

The commonest cause of nephrotic syndrome in children is minimal change disease, which usually responds to a course of high dose corticosteroids. Cyclophosphamide may hasten a remission, but given its cytotoxic profile, should be reserved for steroid-resistant cases. If possible it should be avoided in childhood. Salt poor albumin and IV furosemide may be useful adjuncts for managing oedema, but are not curative of proteinuria.

pediatrics,888,"A 17-year-old woman presented to her GP with poor co-ordination, falls and weight loss. She gave an eight month history of unsteadiness of gait and more recently she had developed slurred speech and a tremor of the upper limb. She denied any alteration in bowel habit, but commented that she had had increased urinary frequency. She had been referred by her GP to the cardiologists with recurrent chest pain and palpitations and was awaiting an appointment. She had no known past medical history, but had been labelled clumsy as a child. There was no apparent family history of neurological disease. On examination she was alert and orientated. Cranial nerve examination revealed scanning speech and gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus. On examination of the upper limb, there was a bilateral intention tremor with marked past pointing. Tone was reduced at both wrists and both supinator reflexes were absent. Light touch was felt at the elbow bilaterally. On examination of the lower limb there was bilateral pes cavus. Tone was markedly reduced at both ankles and there was pyramidal weakness of both legs with absent knee and ankle reflexes and extensor plantar responses. She had a high steppage gait and Romberg's test was positive. On cardiovascular examination there was an ejection systolic murmur along the left sternal edge.

The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy. Given the above history and findings so far, what is the likely diagnosis?",Autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA),Friedreich's ataxia,Mitochondrial disorder,Multiple sclerosis,Subacute combined degeneration of the cord,B,"This patient has all the cardinal features of Friedreich's ataxia. Friedreich's ataxia is an autosomal recessive condition normally presenting within the first decade. The posterior columns, corticospinal and spinocerebellar tracts are affected leading to cerebellum dysfunction, spastic paraparesis and absent reflexes in lower limbs. There is also myocardial muscle involvement leading to hypertrophy and heart failure. Bilateral pes cavus and kyphoscoliosis are common and some patients develop diabetes and optic atrophy. An autosomal dominant SCA is a differential diagnosis for patients presenting with cerebellar dysfunction, however, one would probably expect a family history of neurological disease. Similarly, mitochondrial disorders are a differential diagnosis of patients presenting with ataxia and systemic complications, however, absence of elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lactate would make this diagnosis unlikely. Multiple sclerosis could account for some of the clinical features, but would not explain diabetes and peripheral sensory motor neuropathic changes. In the presence of normal B12 levels, sub-acute combined degeneration of the cord is unlikely."
pediatrics,889,A child of 16 weeks is about to be immunised. Which one of the following would be a contraindication to vaccination?,Cystic fibrosis,Existing febrile illness,History of congenital heart disease,History of epilepsy in sibling,History of febrile convulsions,B,"Vaccinations are not contraindicated if there is a history of febrile convulsions, but appropriate measures should be taken to prevent fever occurring at the time of immunisation. Congenital heart disease is not a contraindication to any form of vaccination. Epilepsy in a sibling or first degree relative is not a contraindication. Any concurrent febrile illness contraindicates immunisation. Cystic fibrosis is not a contraindication."
pediatrics,890,You are a foundation house officer. The midwife calls you to the postnatal ward as a mother would like to speak to you confidentially about whether or not it is safe to breast feed her baby. Which of the following is an absolute contraindication to breast feeding?,A mother who has surface antigen positive hepatitis B,A mother who is receiving a radioactive diagnostic agent,A mother with sputum positive tuberculosis,An infant with galactosaemia,An infant with phenylketonuria,D,"Classic galactosaemia is caused by an inherited deficiency of the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase and often presents in the neonatal period with life threatening illness. Excluding galactose from the diet combined with supportive care is essential, which means no milk or dairy products. Breast feeding and cows' milk formulae are contraindicated. Soya based formulae are given as an alternative. In developed countries, HIV is an absolute contraindication to breast feeding, but if returning to a developing country where clean water is not available, exclusive breast feeding is safer than mixed feeding. Mothers who have active CMV, herpes or varicella zoster should all seek advice regarding breast feeding but none are absolute contraindications. Mothers with active TB can breast feed, and antituberculosis drugs are compatible with breast feeding. The risk of transmission of hepatitis B can virtually be eliminated by immunisation. Breast feeding is not contraindicated. Women receiving a radioactive diagnostic agent should pump and discard milk for a period of time dependent on the plasma half life of the agent. Infants with galactosaemia should not receive breast milk. Breast feeding is not a contraindication in phenylketonuria but senior specialist dietician advice should be sought. "
pediatrics,891,"At birth a 37+3/40 infant is noted to have purple spots and is admitted to the neonatal unit. Pregnancy had been complicated by a mild febrile illness at nine weeks.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital herpes infection,Congenital CMV infection,Congenital rubella,Congenital syphilis,Congenital toxoplasmosis,B,"A congenital infection is strongly suggested by the history of maternal illness in pregnancy, and clinical featues of:  intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) microcephaly (esp. rubella and CMV) macrocephaly (esp. hydrocephalus in toxoplasmosis) purpura, and hepatosplenomegaly  Although all the TORCH organisms (i.e. Toxoplasma, Other - syphilis, hepatitis B, HIV - Rubella, CMV, Herpes) can cause similar pictures, cytomegalovirus (CMV) is by far the commonest in the developed world. In this case the focal chorioretinitis and microcephaly make CMV infection most likely. Additional common features of TORCH infections include:  intracranial calcification chorioretinitis (focal for CMV, diffuse for rubella) deafness, and heart disease (rubella).  "

The likely diagnosis is an autoimmune haemolysis due to 'warm' antibodies. The full blood count may show profound anaemia (for example, 6 g/dl) with spherocytes and very high reticulocyte count. Steroids are usually highly effective. Autoimmune haemolysis associated with 'cold' antibodies may be triggered by Mycoplasma and Epstein-Barr virus, with symptoms worsened by cold."
pediatrics,893,A 2-year-old child presents to the GP as his mother is concerned that he has a 'lazy eye'. Which one of the following can cause a paralytic squint?,Duane syndrome,Hereditary Leber's amaurosis,Retinoblastoma,Retinopathy of prematurity,Severe hypermetropia,A,"Duane syndrome is correct as none of the other options would cause weakness or paralysis of the extraocular muscles. They are all problems affecting the eye itself. Duane syndrome is a rare congenital condition causing a defect in abduction of the eye. The squint may be:  Paralytic or non-paralytic (concomitant) Divergent or convergent Latent or manifest Unilateral or bilateral Permanent or intermittent Horizontal or vertical.  This condition can cause amblyopia if it is not treated. As 50% of patients have a family history, it is necessary to assess the siblings too. A paralytic condition is rare. Deviation varies with direction of eye. It is seen in:  Cerebral palsy, cranial nerve palsies (3- divergent, 4+6- convergent) Weakness of extraocular muscles (for example, Duane's).  In a non-paralytic (concomitant) condition, deviation is unchanged, whatever the direction of gaze. Causes include:  Refractive error (the commonest is hypermetropia, giving convergent squint) Failure to develop binocular vision, and Eye disease (cataracts/retinoblastoma/ROP/corneal scarring)."
pediatrics,894,Which of the following is true of acute osteomyelitis in children?,Blood cultures are always positive,Classical radiological features include a sequestrum and involucrum,Is commonly caused by Streptococcus pyogenes infection,Joint fluid aspiration may be necessary,Usually commences in the epiphysis,D,"Acute osteomyelitis is commonly caused by Staphyloccus aureus infection. It may be acquired by haematogenous route, direct skin puncture following injury or from infection spreading from adjacent soft tissues. It usually commences in the metaphyseal region of long bones, but at later stages could affect the growth plate and epiphyseal cartilage. The child with acute osteomyelitis usually presents after several hours of pain, malaise and fever. The child refuses to walk or to move an affected limb. There is invariably local tenderness over the inflammation; local redness, swelling and oedema are late signs, but joint movement is often painful. Blood cultures may be positive in about 60% of cases. A sequestrum and involucrum are features of chronic osteomyelitis; a sequestrum is a necrotic nidus of bone within a focus of chronic osteomyelitis while an involucrum is a cloak of new bone produced by the periosteum around the infection. If the child is refusing to move the limb/joint, then a joint fluid aspiration may be necessary to distinguish acute osteomyelitis from septic arthritis."

pediatrics,899,You are called to the postnatal ward to see a 'mucousy' baby whose mother feels is struggling to feed and is 'frothing at the mouth'. You note that the baby has a distended abdomen and appears to become peripherally cyanosed when feeding. You suspect that he may have an oesophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula. Which one piece of information would confirm the diagnosis?,Failure to pass a nasogastric tube and improvement with Roux-en-Y tube,Failure to pass a nasogastric tube and symptomatic improvement with Replogle tube,Increased alpha fetoprotein (AFP) on the mother's booking bloods,Oligohydramnios on antenatal scan,Polyhydramnios on antenatal scan,B,"Oesophageal atresia (OA) with trachea-oesophageal fistula (TOF) is seen in about 1 in 3500 births. Over half of the cases of OA are associated with other abnormalities, for example, CHARGE or VACTERL associations. Although it is usually repaired within the first few days of life, chronic morbidity is common, with problems including gastro-oesophageal reflux, oesophageal stricture, feeding difficulties and chronic cough. Eighty five per cent of cases have atresia with a lower pouch fistula. A Roux-en-Y is a surgical anastomosis, usually between two parts of small bowel. Oesophageal atresia characteristically causes excessive oral secretions and mucus and the baby may have difficulty maintaining an airway when trying to feed. A nasogastric tube will usually get stuck at approximately 10 cm. A Replogle tube is used to continuously drain saliva from the upper oesophageal pouch and is positioned 0.5 cm above the end of the oesophageal pouch. Although alpha fetoprotein (AFP) will be raised, other conditions such as spina bifida can also cause an elevated level. OA classically causes polyhydramnios. Although polyhydramnios occurs in almost all mothers with OA without TOF, this type of OA accounts for only 10% of cases. It occurs in only a third of fetuses with OA with a TOF, which is the most common presentation. "

Which of the following infectious agents is most likely to cause this condition?",Escherichia coli,Group A Streptococcus,Group B Streptococcus,Hepatitis A,Influenza,E,"Urine positive for haemoglobin on dipstick, but negative for red blood cells on microscopic examination is probably due to myoglobinuria. This could be confirmed by serum creatine kinase. Acute myoglobinuria may lead to tubular injury and acute renal failure, serum electrolytes and renal functions should be evaluated.

pediatrics,904,"Which of the following organs is in direct contact with the anterior surface of the left kidney, without being separated from it by visceral peritoneum?",Duodenum,Jejunum,Pancreas,Spleen,Stomach,C,"The spleen and stomach, though in contact are covered in omentum. The pancreas is retroperitoneal."
pediatrics,905,Which of the following is commonly associated with congenital hypothyroidism in the neonatal period:,A small anterior fontanelle,Diarrhoea,Hypothermia,Inguinal hernia,Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia,C,Hypothermia results from reduced metabolic rate. Constipation rather than diarrhoea is a common clinical feature. Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is a relatively uncommon sequela. The anterior fontanelle would be tense. Umbilical rather than inguinal herniae are associated.
pediatrics,906,"A 3-year-old child is seen by her primary care physician after the nursery have commented that when she is tired her right eye appears to turn inwards. On examination there are normal eye movements with no obvious in turning or out turning of the eye. The cover test is normal, but following the rapid cover test it is apparent that the right eye turns inwards. What is the diagnosis?",A right sided esometropia,A right sided esophoria,A right sided exometropia,A right sided exophoria,A right sided paralytic esometropia,B,"A squint can present as either latent (-phoria) or manifest (-tropia). A manifest squint is present all the time and usually apparent on observation of the eyes, if it is not apparent then it should become more so on the cover test. A latent squint is not always present but manifests in certain situations for example when the child is tired. A latent squint may not be apparent on observation of the eyes or on the cover test but should become apparent on the rapid cover test. A convergent squint (where the eye turns inwards or nasally) is traditionally referred to as eso- and a divergent squint (where the eye turns outwards or temporally) is referred to as exo-. A paralytic squint is a result of paralysis of one or more of the extraocular muscles and so the child would have an obvious and permanent squint with a deficit in eye movement noted on examination."
pediatrics,907,A 10-month-old infant is seen by the health visitor. She is very worried as he is not gaining weight and has fallen across two growth centiles - he was born on the 75th centile and now is almost at only the 9th centile. He has loss of muscle mass and appears wasted with a generalised skin rash. You decide to admit the child after ruling out an organic cause for his failure to thrive. What is the most important goal of hospitalising this child?,Achieve sustained catch up growth,Assess the child's developmental status,Check whether the parent has a mental health illness affecting their care-giving,Document the food the child is given by his parents,Observe the child to see if they are a food refuser,A,"Since failure to thrive can have a marked effect on brain growth, the hospital environment is not the ideal place to do this. Although all of these points are important, it must be clear that you are not admitting the child to simply 'spy' on the child or the parent. However, parental factors such as depression and child factors such as having a food aversion may be important. The interaction between the child and parent is also important to observe. The main points for admission is to try and achieve sustained catch up growth, so on discharge this can then be continued at home. Whilst the child is an inpatient they can also have intensive review by the dietician with the prescription of calorie supplements or a placement of a nasogastric tube to aid nutrition. If the child has severe malnutrition or further diagnostic and laboratory evaluation are needed these can be completed."

A fever greater than 39.4°C is associated with severe disease, and treatment is by surgical drainage."
pediatrics,909,"A baby is admitted on the neonatal unit. When making up an infusion, it is noted that the weight of the baby has been entered on the drug chart as 13.7 kg, but is known to be a premature baby, who is 4-days-old. The baby is reviewed and the observation chart checked. It is confirmed that the weight should be 1.37 kg. It is noted that a number of infusions are already running. What is the most appropriate action in this case?","Change the weight on the drug chart, crossing out the incorrect weight",Leave the unit immediately as you had no previous involvement in the case,Promptly put matters right regarding drugs being administered to the baby then discuss your concerns with a senior colleague and report the incident,Speak with the nurse looking after the baby and change the rate of the infusions running,Speak with the parents of the baby and inform them that the baby has had a reaction to the drugs,C,"Once the issue of potential harm to the child has been dealt with, it is appropriate to inform a senior colleague, reporting the details of the incident as soon as is reasonably practicable. It is important that the baby is reviewed and that any error is discussed with the parents at the earliest possible opportunity, offering an apology if appropriate. It is important that staff members are open and honest, and given an opportunity to report their involvement so that lessons may be learned to prevent such an incident occurring again, including a review of protocols. Guidance from the GMC on Good Medical Practice states:  andquot;You must be open and honest with patients if things go wrong.

Her mother noted a purple rash over her eyelids and recalls that some little white lumps have recently appeared over the pads of her fingers. She complains of general malaise and lethargy. What is the best investigation that will lead you to the diagnosis?,Creatinine kinase,Electronmyography,ESR,MRI,Muscle biopsy,E,"This child has juvenile dermatomyositis. She presents with the typical heliotrope rash over her eyelids and proximal muscle weakness, which is symmetrical and occurs at the shoulder and hip girdles. This child will be Gower's sign positive, but this is not unique to this condition. Diagnosis is made by a raised ESR, raised creatinine kinase and characteristic electronmyography findings. A muscle biopsy is diagnostic. An MRI is sometimes used following diagnosis to assess the degree of inflammation."
pediatrics,911,Which of the following statements is true of the pulmonary function test's vital capacity (VC)?,Vital capacity cannot be measured from spirometry alone,Vital capacity is increased in emphysema and reduced in interstitial fibrosis,Vital capacity is the maximal amount of air which can be exhaled after maximal inspiration,Vital capacity is the sum of tidal volume (VT) and inspiratory capacity (IC),"Vital capacity, when reduced, is a specific indication of restrictive lung disease",C,Vital capacity is the maximal amount of air which can be exhaled after maximal inspiration.
pediatrics,912,A 9-year-old boy is brought to accident and emergency unresponsive. He had no pulse so immediate CPR was started. The mother mentions a brief history of high grade fever for the past 24 hours. After one cycle the child is intubated but no IV access was obtained. What is the next step in the management plan?,Give adrenaline via endotracheal tube,Give atropine via endotracheal tube,Give IM adrenaline,Insert an intraosseous (IO) line,Try to get another IV line after the second cycle,D,"Septic shock is a distributive shock, characterised by leaking of fluids from the capillaries as a result of toxins acting on the endothelium. Therefore, fluid resuscitation up to 60 mL/kg is a priority. Even if the child has another aetiology for the shock, IV or IO access is needed. Generally, it is accepted to try inserting an IV line for 90 seconds before deciding to insert an IO line in absolute emergency cases. One cycle of CPR is 120 seconds so it is optimal to get an IV or IO access within the first cycle. Giving medications via the endotracheal tube is the least preferred route because there is a high variability of absorption. "
pediatrics,913,An 8-year-old girl presented with persistent bleeding from her gums. There was no past history of note except her mother's report that she andquot;bruises easilyandquot;. Her mother has a history of menorrhagia. There is no personal or family history of bleeding into joints or muscles. Baseline investigations revealed a normal full blood count and coagulation studies revealed an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and bleeding time. Reduced factor VIII was detected. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Christmas disease,Haemophilia A,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Vitamin K deficiency,von Willebrand's disease,E,"von Willebrand factor has three main roles in stopping bleeding:  It brings platelets into contact with the exposed subendothelium It promotes platelet to platelet adhesion, and It also has a role in binding factor VIII, thereby preventing its breakdown in the circulation.  Signs of VWD are those of a platelet disorder and include easy bruising, persistent nose bleeds, menorrhagia and increased bleeding after dental work. Blood tests show a increased APTT and decreased Factor VIII (as broken down without VWF). Further studies would show decreased VWF levels and/or activity."

Our duty is to the child we are caring for and hence they should be fully involved in all discussions unless they could suffer serious harm because of it. All members of the healthcare team and family can and should be involved in palliative care discussions, and we should ensure that there is appropriate support for the child, family and also healthcare professionals during this difficult time. Palliative care can involve further therapy or surgery to provide symptomatic relief. The andquot;doctrine of double effectandquot; covers ethical issues surrounding giving large doses of analgesics.

Clinical exam revealed an unwell-looking girl, lethargic with sunken eyes and dry mucous membranes, in addition to subcostal recession with diffuse wheezes over both lung fields. You decide to admit the patient for fluid support and further investigations. Investigations revealed:    White blood cell count 23 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Neutrophils 4.6 ×10^9/L (3-10)   Lymphocytes 16.1 ×10^9/L (2-8.5)   Eosinophils 1.4 ×10^9/L (0.1-2)   Basophils 0.1 ×10^9/L (0.0-0.1)   Haemoglobin 131 g/L (90-135)   Platelets 512 ×10^9/L (150-400)   C-reactive protein 21 mg/L (less than5)    What is the most appropriate definitive diagnostic test?",Chest x ray,Infant pulmonary function tests,Lateral neck x ray,Pernasal swab for culture or PCR,Pernasal swab for ELISA rapid antigen detection,D,"Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, has become very rare after the introduction of vaccination. Nevertheless, it still occurs in young infants even if the vaccination was given. A cough that is whooping in nature can present at any stage of the illness or not at all. There are several indicators of pertussis infection in this patient, which include severe and worsening respiratory symptoms, leucocytosis with lymphocytosis greater than50%, and thrombocytosis. Although it would be appropriate to order a chest x ray for such a patient, it is unlikely to provide a definitive diagnosis because the blood results are not consistent with a bacterial pneumonia. ELISA rapid antigen detection can be used to confirm respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection, but is not used to diagnose pertussis. Pertussis can be confirmed by pernasal swab for culture or PCR. Infant pulmonary function tests are rather complicated tests that need sedation and are not present in most healthcare settings. In addition, they do not have any diagnostic value; they are used to assess severity only. "

pediatrics,923,You see a 12-year old girl in clinic who plots on the 98th BMI centile. She demands to know why she is overweight. Which of the following is the most appropriate explanation for her?,Medication is a common cause of obesity in children,Most evidence for the causes of obesity in children comes from randomised controlled trials,Most risk factors for obesity are not modifiable (i.e. genetic variants),Small for gestational age babies are at increased risk of obesity,"White children have an increased risk of obesity compared with Hispanic, black, South Asian or Native American children",D,"Obesity is caused by a higher energy intake than expenditure. It is difficult to determine the individual contribution of each risk factor for obesity as most are difficult to measure and often dependent on each other. Many studies have reported associations with a wide range of risk factors and childhood obesity, but confounding or even reverse causality could explain the associations. The role of medication in causing obesity has not been extensively studied. There are few randomised controlled trials (which provide the most solid evidence) identifying causes of obesity. Some risk factors are not modifiable, for example genetic variants, but most are common and modifiable, such as low physical activity levels, high dietary fat intake, sweetened drink consumption and television viewing levels. Small for gestational age babies are at increased risk of obesity through a phenomenon known as 'catch-up growth.' This is when a child experiences a period of accelerated growth velocity to compensate for a period of slowed growth until they get back towards their genetic trajectory. It is thought that factors that signal and regulate postnatal catch-up growth may contribute to the pathogenesis underlying the fetal origins hypothesis. Hispanic, black, South Asian or Native American children have an increased risk of obesity compared with white children. "
pediatrics,924,"A 2-month-old infant presents with cough and reduced oral intake for the past three days. The cough is very severe and usually comes in bouts. He had a history of conjunctivitis for five days. The mother did not receive proper perinatal care, but the baby and mother were healthy around birth. On examination, you hear a severe staccato cough and mild basal crepitation. Eye exam showed scant mucoid discharge and eyelid swelling. Investigations revealed:    White blood cell count 11.9 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Neutrophils 6 ×10^9/L (3-10)   Lymphocytes 2.4 ×10^9/L (2-8.5)   Eosinophils 3.36 ×10^9/L (0.1-2)   Basophils 0.1 ×10^9/L (0.0-0.1)   Red blood cell count 5.0 ×10^12/L -   Haemoglobin 152 g/L (100-180)   Platelets 176 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Reticulocytes 0.9% (0.2-2.0)   C-reactive protein 32 mg/L (less than5)   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 16 mm/h (less than13)    Chest x ray shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. What is the most appropriate diagnostic test?",Eye swab culture on chocolate agar,Eye swab for culture with Giemsa stain,PCR for nasopharyngeal aspirates,Pernasal swab for culture,Throat swab for culture,B,"Chlamydia trachomatis infection in neonates is relatively rare, especially in developed countries. Good perinatal care and tests usually detect chlamydial infection, for which proper treatment can be initiated to prevent vertical transmission to the newborn baby, and to prevent infertility, which is a complication of chlamydial colonisation in the genital tract. The usual presentation in neonates is conjunctivitis only, but respiratory involvement can occur. This patient has a history of conjunctivitis and pertussis-like cough. The timing of the onset of symptoms and the lack of perinatal care increases the suspicion of Chlamydia trachomatis. This is further supported by the blood eosinophilia seen with chlamydial infection, rather than lymphocytosis seen with pertussis. Chlamydia trachomatis can be detected by eye swab culture on Giemsa stain. Pernasal swab culture and PCR for nasopharyngeal aspirates are used to confirm pertussis. Culture of chocolate agar is used to detect gonococcal conjunctivitis."

She has audible stridor when agitated, and she has very tender glands in the neck. Her temperature is 38.6°C, respiratory rate 20/min and heart rate 100/min. She has moderate neck stiffness. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylaxis,Croup,Foreign body aspiration,Peritonsillar abscess,Retropharyngeal abscess,E,"The history suggests a tonsillitis progressing to retropharyngeal abscess with increasing upper airways obstruction. ENT examination in children with stridor should take place where facilities are available for immediate intubation. In this case it revealed a massively enlarged right tonsil with profuse exudate. This required surgical drainage and removal with antibiotic cover. Retropharyngeal abscess occurs in retropharyngeal nodes, which involute at 5 years, so are commonest in 3-4-year-old boys. There is irritability, decreased oral intake, and drooling. There may be neck stiffness, torticollis, and refusal to move the neck.   "

pediatrics,932,"A 5-year-old boy presented to the Emergency department with a history of sudden cough waking him at night, which started one hour ago. On examination you note that the child is sitting comfortably in bed with a moderate seal-like cough. The examination is otherwise normal. What is the next step in the management plan?",Nebulised adrenaline,Neck x ray,Oral dexamethasone,Take a FBC and a throat swab for Candamp;S,Urgent call for an anaesthetist,C,"Croup is a common presentation in the paediatric population. It is more common in males between 6 months and 6 years of age, characterised by its seal-like or barking cough which is usually sudden and occurs at night. The severity of croup can range from mild to impending respiratory failure. The croup in this case is mild, so oral dexamethasone is the treatment of choice. Nebulised adrenaline can give a more rapid improvement of symptoms but there might be a rebound of symptoms after 4 hours when its effect starts to wear off. Moreover, nebulisers may lead to more agitation which in turn will make the symptoms worse. There is no need to do a neck x ray to see the steeple sign in this case as the patient has a classic history of croup. Diagnosis of croup is clinical and it is usually caused by viral infections. So, FBC and throat swab Candamp;S are not indicated. An urgent call for an anaesthetist would be needed if epiglottis was suspected, but it is highly unlikely here as the child is well. "

The antecedent throat infection makes post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis most likely. Throat swab, antistreptolysin-O test (ASOT) and anti-DNAase B may confirm this. C3 is usually low. The severity varies from transient asymptomatic haematuria to severe nephritis with acute renal and heart failure. Treatment is supportive, with assiduous attention to fluid balance. Penicillin is usually given but probably does not influence the disease course nor spread to family members. 95% recover completely."
pediatrics,935,"A 6-year-old girl is referred by the school with poor attention during class. Mother has also noted brief episodes of about 10-20 seconds when she seems to be 'in a world of her own'. These have occurred about three to five times a day for the past two months. She is otherwise well. Full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. Immunisations up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination she is apyrexial and well, well grown and there are no abnormalities on detailed neurological examination. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Complex partial,"Generalised, atonic",Partial with secondary generalisation,Absence seizures (Petit mal) atypical,Absence seizures (Petit mal) typical,E,"The history suggests absence seizures. This is a form of generalised epilepsy associated with 3 Hz spike and wave discharges, which may be brought on by hyperventilation. Atypical absences often last a bit longer than typical absences. They often have some physical movement with them such as a brief head nod. The treatment is with sodium valproate. Carbamazepine worsens them. "
pediatrics,936,"A 4-year-old boy presents with dizziness and vomiting. He has been unwell over the past few days with fever, right ear pain and discharge. He had a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he has a fever of 38.6°C, RR 20/min and HR 100/min. Chest is clear. He has a purulent discharge from his right ear. He has nystagmus, and walks with a broad-based gait. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acoustic neuroma,Alcohol ingestion,Brain abscess,Encephalitis,Vestibulitis,E,The history suggests an acute otitis media with developing ataxia and vomiting. This suggests extension of the infection into the vestibular apparatus. From there it can extend into the brain. IV antibiotics and surgical drainage may be required.
pediatrics,937,Which of the following diseases is a good example of locus heterogeneity?,Alport syndrome,Duchenne muscular dystrophy,Hemophilia A,Myotonic dystrophy,Prader-Willi syndrome,A,"Locus heterogeneity refers to a single disorder, trait, or pattern of traits caused by mutations in genes at different chromosomal loci. In Alport syndrome there are multiple gene defects that can present similarly."
pediatrics,938,"You are asked to review an 8-year-old boy who has a history of recurrent sinusitis for one year. It is associated with a cough which increases in severity at night, especially when lying supine. His parents are concerned about his poor weight gain despite his voracious appetite. He had an appendectomy when he was 6 years old. There was no clear perinatal history as he was born in Tunisia. On examination you note an increased anteroposterior diameter of the chest, chest wheezes, and finger clubbing. What is the next step in the management plan?",Arrange a sweat test,Order a FBC and immunoglobulin level,Prescribe oral antacids and review after two weeks,Refer to an immunologist,Trial of short acting beta-2 agonist,A,"Cystic fibrosis is a chronic disease that can present at any age. There are different modes of presentation including recurrent sinusitis, GORD, asthma, malabsorption and distal intestinal obstruction syndrome. The history of this child is consistent with CF, keeping in mind that only a few countries screen for cystic fibrosis in the neonatal period. A sweat test is the preferred test for cystic fibrosis due to its cost-effectiveness and short waiting period for results. Checking FBC and immunoglobulin level is useful to rule out primary immunodeficiency, but the history and clinical signs are more consistent with cystic fibrosis. Although the child may benefit from antacid, GORD does not cause finger clubbing or recurrent sinusitis. Referral to an immunologist is inappropriate in this case; such patients should be referred to a respiratory physician. Cystic fibrosis patients usually benefit from beta-2 agonist, but this patient obviously has more than just asthma. "
pediatrics,939,You see a 5-year-old boy with Down's syndrome and otitis media with effusion (OME). He has significant hearing loss. His mother wants to know what the next step in his treatment should be.

Ventilation tubes can be considered if they are not effective.
pediatrics,940,"A 14-year-old boy presents with a confused state. He developed a fever two days previously, and had been complaining of headache, fever and photophobia. He had vomited once. Previous history was unremarkable. On examination his temperature was 38.0°C (tympanic), and he has mild neck stiffness and photophobia. There is no rash. HR is 82/min and RR 12/min. There are no focal signs of infection. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Diabetic ketoacidosis,Hepatic failure,Hypoglycaemia,"Infection e.g. meningitis, encephalitis",Substance abuse,D,"The history is suggestive of viral encephalitis. This is most often caused by enteroviral infection, with herpes simplex causing more severe cases. Mumps meningitis was previously very common until universal measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccination was introduced."
pediatrics,941,"A 15-year-old girl presents with a three month history of diplopia, ptosis, and tiredness that worsens towards the end of the day. In addition, she is not eating her usual evening meal because she finds it hard to chew and swallow. She has a history of type 1 diabetes, which is well controlled. On examination she has no muscle wasting or fasciculations with normal deep tendon reflexes. What is the most appropriate diagnostic test?",Antinuclear antibodies (ANA),Creatine kinase,ELISA,Muscle biopsy,Serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody analysis,E,"Myasthenia gravis is an acquired autoimmune disorder at the post-synaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction in skeletal muscles. It presents with progressive weakness over the day due to destruction of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor by circulating antibodies. Presence of other autoimmune disorders is a risk factor. Serum anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody analysis is a simple test to perform with a high sensitivity. It confirms 90% of cases. Myasthenia gravis is associated with other autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes mellitus. Creatine kinase is a non-specific test used to measure skeletal muscle destruction as in idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, which can also be detected by muscle biopsy. Botulism can present with a similar picture but is usually more acute and can be detected by ELISA. "
pediatrics,942,Pneumothorax in neonates and infants is most commonly associated with which of the following?,Neonatal meconium aspiration syndrome,Pertussis,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Staphylococcal pneumonia,The use of positive airways pressure in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome,E,"Pneumothorax is most commonly associated with positive pressure ventilation for premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome. It is also associated with meconium aspiration. Pneumothorax in infancy may occur as a consequence of staphylococcal pneumonia and can occur with pneumococcal pneumonia, pertussis (whooping cough) and TB. Trauma is a cause at all ages. In the developing world pyogenic lung infection (74%) and TB (21%) account for the majority of spontaneous pneumothoraces.."
pediatrics,943,A 10-year-old girl from the Indian subcontinent presents with pallor and mild jaundice. She has frontal bossing and maxillary overgrowth. On palpation of her abdomen she is noted to have hepatosplenomegaly. Her full blood count shows the following results:    Hb 90 g/L (115-165)   MCV 60 (80-96)   RDW 12% (11-15)    Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Anaemia of chronic disease,Folate deficiency,Iron deficiency anaemia,Sickle cell disease,Thalassaemia,E,"This child has thalassaemia from the history, examination findings and results of the full blood count. The mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a measure of the average red blood cell volume (that is, size). Whether an anaemia is microcytic or macrocytic can be a clue to the aetiology- the most common causes are thalassaemia and iron deficiency.  The mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) is the average mass of haemoglobin per red blood cell. In thalassaemia as the red blood cell is lacking in the beta globin the haemoglobin is reduced and the cell is small. The red cell width (RDW) is a measure of the variation of red blood cell width. Usually red blood cells are a standard size and remain so in the case of thalassaemia as all the cells are the same.  In anaemia of chronic disease the MCV is usually normal In iron deficiency anaemia the Hb is low and the RDW is increased In haemoglobinopathies all the results can either be increased or decreased."

Respiratory rate is 15/min and heart rate 95/min. He is well perfused and alert. His throat shows bilateral red tonsillar pillars and scattered palatal petechiae, but no pus on the tonsils. Ear and nose examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Epiglottitis,Group A streptococcal infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Influenza infection,Retropharyngeal abscess,B,"The history of fever and sore throat with red tonsillar pillars suggests a pharyngitis. Potential bacterial pathogens include Group A Streptococcus. Viral pathogens include Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Unfortunately clinical examination is unreliable in differentiating them, but the following make bacterial infection more likely:  high fever absence of cold symptoms age 5-15 years, and petechiae on the palate.  Palatal petechiae may also occur in infectious mononucleosis (IM), but this infection is less common at this age. IM may also have maculopapular rash, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice and more impressive lymphadenopathy."

He has swelling oedema around the eyes, with scrotal enlargement which transilluminates. His abdomen is distended and dull to percussion. Dipstick of the urine shows 4+ proteinuria. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Angio-oedema,Cardiac failure,Nephrotic syndrome,Orthostatic proteinuria,Transient proteinuria (benign),C,"The history of gross oedema and proteinuria are characteristic of nephrotic syndrome. Hypertriglyceridaemia is usually present, and the proteinuria is gross. Most cases are caused by minimal change glomerulonephritis (MCGN). This responds to steroid therapy so consistently the renal biopsy is only needed in non-responders or those with atypical features. MCGN shows no abnormalities on light microscopy of the renal biopsy but electron microscope (EM) changes. Careful attention to fluid balance is required. This is challenging because patients appear fluid overloaded, but the fluid is mainly in the tissues and their intravascular compartment is relatively depleted."

pediatrics,950,"A 7-year-old boy is stung by a wasp. He develops marked redness and swelling at the site of the sting, then inspiratory stridor, then he collapses. He was a full term normal delivery with no neonatal complications. His immunisations are up to date. There is no FH/SH of note. On examination he is unconscious but self-ventilating at 16/min. Oxygen saturations are 94% in 100% facemask oxygen. He has mild stridor but minimal recession, and looks generally swollen over the face and trunk. What is the most important element of management?",Adrenaline IM,Chlorpheniramine IV,Hydrocortisone IV,Intubation,Salbutamol nebulised,A,"The history is of rapidly progressive throat narrowing, followed by collapse, precipitated by a wasp sting. The diagnosis is anaphylaxis, due to an extreme immunoglobulin (Ig)E mediated reaction, causing intravascular fluid depletion from third spacing and circulatory collapse. Intramuscular (IM) adrenaline, IV hydrocortisone, nebulised salbutamol and IV chlorpheniramine may all be needed. Since saturations are currently satisfactory with facemask oxygen it is not necessary to intubate at this stage. An anaesthetist should be called just in case this becomes necessary. Specific desensitisation is possible, through an extended course of injections, but avoidance is best. He should carry a Medicalert bracelet and the school and parents instructed in the use of adrenaline autoinjectors. "

Serum sodium 127 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 5.8 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 12.9 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Galactosaemia,Hypopituitarism,MCAD deficiency,A,"The history is of severe weight loss (more than 15% of birth weight) and significant intravascular volume depletion suggesting early shock. It is essential to exclude a salt-losing congenital adrenal hyperplasia in such cases. Serum electrolytes show low Na and elevated K and urea. Serum 17-OH progesterone is elevated in the commonest form, 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Virilisation is common in female infants, but may be clinically difficult to see in males (because of increased scrotal pigmentation?)."
pediatrics,953,An 8-year-old child is involved in a road traffic accident in which he is knocked off his bike by a car. Witnesses report his head hit the windscreen and then his body bounced backwards and his head hit the ground as well. On admission in the Emergency department he has a GCS of 3. A CT head reveals multiple skull fractures with bilateral subdural haematomas and significant intraparenchymal haemorrhage. He is intubated and transferred to paediatric intensive care. What is the most important next action to prevent the development or extension of secondary brain injury?,Cautious fluid bolus and inotropes to prevent hypotension,Cooling and antipyretics to prevent hyperthermia,Steroids to prevent raised intracranial pressure,Surgery to drain the subdural haematomas,Ventriculostomy to drain CSF,A,"Traumatic brain injury in children results from primary trauma to the brain and secondary damage as a result of inflammation and ischaemia. Maintaining adequate cerebral blood flow is crucial in the prevention of secondary brain injury. The initial management consists of ABC - airway and breathing to prevent hypoxia or hypercarbia followed by maintenance of an adequate blood pressure with cautious fluids and inotropes to prevent cerebral hypoperfusion. Thereafter management involves preventing raised intracranial pressure (ICP) which in itself results in cerebral hypoperfusion. This can be managed through monitoring the ICP, positioning the bed at a 30 degree angle, prevention of hyperthermia, sedation and analgesia to control pain and surgery to drain/evacuate haematomas or to create a ventriculostomy allowing CSF to drain appropriately. If there is still difficulty controlling the ICP mannitol can be used as can hyperventilation."
pediatrics,954,Which one of the following is a recognised feature of abetalipoproteinaemia?,A high serum cholesterol,Abnormal red blood cell morphology,Advanced atherosclerotic vascular disease,Palmar xanthomas,Severe mental retardation,B,"Abetalipoproteinaemia causes neurodegenerative nervous system changes but IQ is usually normal. Other clinical manifestations include ataxia with retinitis pigmentosa steatorrhoea and malabsorption, which may lead to osteopaenia and skeletal fractures. Radiologically, there is thickening of the mucosal folds of the duodenum and jejunum. Acanthocytes are seen in the peripheral blood film. Inheritance is autosomal recessive."
pediatrics,955,A 5-month-old male infant has a history of progressive difficulty feeding for one month. Some meals are associated with irritability or sometimes vomiting followed by crying and refusal to feed for half an hour. The child is mainly breastfed. On examination the child looks well nourished with appropriate weight and height. What is the next step in the management plan?,Order an oesophageal 24 hour pH study,Prescribe Gaviscon,Put the infant in prone and left lateral position while sleeping,Reassurance,Stop breastfeeding and prescribe anti-regurgitant formula,D,"This is a classical history of GORD, where a child has difficulty with feeding followed by refusal to feed for some time after vomiting, due to pain associated with acid reflux. There is no single correct treatment or investigation for this disorder because treatments and investigations are dependent on the severity of symptoms. As this child is well nourished, reassurance is preferred, emphasising that this disorder usually resolves in time, especially after starting to introduce solid food to the infant's diet. The gold standard for the diagnosis of GORD is oesophageal 24 hour pH study, but it is not indicated at this stage. Although antacid can be considered in more severe conditions, some medical literature would argue that safety and efficacy of Gaviscon is not well established in this age group. Putting the infant in prone and left lateral position while awake and under supervision can relieve GORD, but this should not be recommended while the infant is sleeping due to the increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Stopping breastfeeding should not be encouraged even if the patient has more severe symptoms. "

He is likely to have a sunken fontanelle, as he is very dehydrated. Pyloric stenosis would be highly likely, because of the age and hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis seen. He should be resuscitated with normal saline first. Dilated bowel would not be expected, as pyloric, rather than small bowel obstruction, is present."
pediatrics,957,Which of the following is true regarding cerebral palsy?,Epilepsy is present in 40%,Hearing loss is present in 5%,Learning impairment is present in 30%,The incidence is 2 per 100 live births,Visual impairment occurs in 50%,A,"Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement and posture due to a non-progressive lesion of the motor pathways in the developing brain. The clinical manifestations tend to evolve with age. The incidence is 2 per 1000 live births, and other problems are common and reflect more widespread damage to the brain. These include:  Epilepsy in 40% Squints in 30% Hearing loss and visual impairment in 20%, and Speech and language disorders.  In addition, there may be considerable behavioural problems. Learning difficulties in cerebral palsy can be absent, mild, moderate or severe and generalised or specific. As with the non-affected population there is a spectrum of impairments, and therefore incidence varies depending on the definition used by the study. A reasonable estimate is a 45% incidence of learning impairment, with 25% classified as severe (IQ less than50). Copyright "

The organism attaches to ciliated epithelium, so it is spread by coughing and in nasal secretions. However, as it is difficult to culture the diagnosis is mostly clinical. A whoop may not be present, but apnoeic episodes can occur. Lymphocytosis is often observed. The annual death rate in the UK is very low. "
pediatrics,963,A 15-year-old female is a close contact of a student who has developed meningitis C. The last contact she had with her friend was two days ago when her friend developed headache. She has not received any previous vaccination for meningitis. What is the most appropriate action for this girl?,No treatment is required and the girl can be reassured,She should receive the meningococcal C vaccination only,She should receive the meningococcal C vaccination plus ciprofloxacin,She should receive meningococcal immunoglobulin only,Treat with rifampicin only,C,"This girl runs a reasonably high risk of developing meningitis and should receive meningitis C vaccination together with chemoprophlaxis. UK Public Health guidance (referenced below) now recommends ciprofloxacin as first-line chemoprophylaxis in all age groups and in pregnancy. This has replaced rifampicin, as it can be given as a single dose, does not interact with oral contraceptives and is more readily available in community pharmacies. The risk of arthropathy in children (which is why it is not usually given to children) has been found to be very low, with only transient arthralgia which was considered to be coincidental in most cases.  Close contacts of those with confirmed serogroup C meningococcal disease who were only immunised in infancy or whom have completed the immunisation course more than one year before should be offered an extra dose of the Meningitis C conjugate vaccine. The quadrivalent conjugate vaccine is reserved for contacts of cases of confirmed serogroup A, W135 or Y infection (or probable cases where these organisms are found on nasopharyngeal swab).  "

Enlargement of the testes of greater than 2.5 cm in length or 4 mls in volume is a reliable indicator of puberty in males. Precocious puberty is approximately five times more common in females. Ossification centres appear in early life, and ultimately the epiphysis or growth plate will fuse with the shaft of the long bones and from then further growth will not occur. Most females have reached peak height velocity 1.3 years before menarche."

Metabolic causes include:  galactosaemia juvenile onset diabetes infant of diabetic mother hypoparathyroidism hypocalcaemia occulocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe Wilson's Disease (later onset) sphingolipodoses mucopolysaccharidoses, and mucolipidoses.  Other causes include:  Congenital infection Chromosomal, e.g. trisomy 13, 18, 21, Turner's, and Drugs, e.g. steroids.  The majority of metabolic diseases have progressive deterioration in cataract, while at birth the commonest causes will be congenital infection, infant of diabetic mother, or Lowe's Syndrome. "
pediatrics,967,Which of the following incubation periods are correct for the diseases stated?,Chicken pox five to seven days,Hand foot and mouth disease seven to 10 days,Measles five to seven days,Mumps 14-18 days,Rubella seven to 10 days,D,"It is important to know the incubation periods of disorders, as potentially treatments can be offered to attenuate or prevent the condition, e.g. chicken pox in pregnant females or tetanus. Incubation periods:  Chicken pox 7-21 days Whooping cough average 10-14 days (range 6-20) Hand, foot and mouth disease 2-6 days German measles 14-21 days Mumps 14-18 days^1.  "
pediatrics,968,You are asked to review a baby on the labour ward. He was born approximately one hour previously by spontaneous vaginal delivery. The obstetric history is significant for oligohydramnios but the antenatal ultrasound scans were otherwise normal and there are no risk factors for sepsis. The baby had Apgars of 7 and 8 but the midwife is concerned as the baby still appears quite dusky and over the last 15 minutes has started to grunt. On examination the baby is grunting and has oxygen saturations of 80% in air. You notice the baby has bilateral flank masses. As you are arranging to transport the baby to the neonatal unit the midwife whispers that the parents are first cousins. What is the most likely diagnosis at this stage?,Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease,Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease,Bilateral Wilms' tumour,Primary Fanconi syndrome,Unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney,B,"The typical presentation of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is in the neonatal period with bilateral flank masses. The diagnosis is even more likely in the presence of an infant with breathing difficulties which are as a result of oligohydramnios causing pulmonary hypoplasia. Autsomal recessive polycystic kidney disease has an incidence of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 40,000 live births (Nelson's Textbook of Paediatrics ref above). It ultimately leads to end stage renal failure within the first decade of life and is also known to be associated with hepatic fibrosis. Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease usually does not present until late childhood or adolescence and whilst it also ultimately leads to renal failure it often does not do so until adulthood. It may present in the neonatal period with abdominal masses but usually not in the presence of respiratory problems or oligohydramnios. A unilateral multicystic dysplastic kidney may present with a palpable mass but not bilaterally and the renal function is usually normal as a result of the one normal kidney so oligohydramnios and breathing problems are not associated. Bilateral Wilms' tumour is extremely rare in the neonatal period and often whilst it may present with abdominal masses is not usually associated with renal failure, oligohydramnios and respiratory problems.  Primary Fanconi syndrome does not usually present with bilateral flank masses or respiratory distress in the neonatal period."
pediatrics,969,A neonate does not pass meconium for 48 hours after birth. A fortnight later his mother states that he is not passing stool regularly. He has been bottle fed since discharge. Investigations reveal massive dilatation of the colon proximal to the rectum and manometry shows increased internal anal pressure on rectal distension with a balloon. Where is the developmental abnormality responsible for this child's presentation?,Ectoderm,Endoderm,Neural crest,Neural ectoderm,Splanchnic mesoderm,C,This is Hirschsprung's disease which is due to absence of the ganglion cells supplying the colonic smooth muscle. Neural crest contributes to the formation of the postganglionic neurones of the autonomic nervous system and the sensory neurones of the peripheral nervous system.
pediatrics,970,A child of 5 years is suspected to have Giardiasis. Which one of the following drugs is the most appropriate treatment?,Cefuroxime,Cotrimoxazole,Metronidazole,Penicillin V,Tetracycline,C,"Giardia lamblia can cause malabsorption which resolves with treatment, diarrheoa is non-bloody. It can be acquired locally and stool microscopy may be negative. It is treated with metronidazole."
pediatrics,971,What proportion of children born with some degree of hearing impairment are detected by neonatal screening as being at 'high-risk' of having congenital hearing loss?,25%,50%,75%,95%,100%,B,"A number of risk factors are associated with neonatal hearing loss. Traditional newborn screening methods involve screening of only these high-risk infants. The risk factors considered include:  Family history of hearing loss Prematurity Low birth weight Neonatal jaundice Rubella or non-bacterial intrauterine infection Anoxia Craniofacial deformity Bacterial meningitis, and Apgar score of 0-3.  Only half of the total number of children born with a hearing impairment are detected by these high-risk screening programmes. The other half have no obvious risk factors to alert parents or professionals to the presence of the hearing loss. For each child detected by high-risk screening, another child goes home undetected. Universal newborn hearing screening has been introduced to ensure most children have their hearing loss detected from birth."
pediatrics,972,"A 6-year-old child fell on his nose 2 days ago. His parents have now brought him with difficulty in breathing. Examination: fever, nasal bones are straight. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Nasal polyp,Septal hematoma,Septal abscess,Deviated nasal septum,Fracture nose,B,Septal abscess takes a bit more time and a considerable portion of caseof septal hematoma is associated with fever
pediatrics,973,Which of the following clinical manifestations suggests Guillain-Barré Syndrome?,Asymmetrical involvement of distal muscles,Brisk tendon reflexes,Bulbar involvement in about 50% of cases,Normal CSF protein,Weakness beginning in the arms,C,"Guillain-Barré is a post-infectious polyneuropathy causing demyelination in mainly motor but also sensory nerves. It usually follows a non-specific viral infection. Campylobacter and Mycoplasma are recognised causes. Weakness begins in the legs and progressively ascends to involve the trunk, upper limbs and finally the bulbar muscles (Landry's ascending paralysis). Asymmetry is present in only 9% of patients, with symmetrical involvement being typical. Usually there is painless progression over days or weeks, but in cases of abrupt onset, there may be tenderness or muscle pain. Complications include:  Bulbar involvement occurs in 50%, with a risk of aspiration and respiratory insufficiency which can be problematic. In the Miller-Fisher syndrome there is external ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. In 20% of cases there is urinary incontinence or retention.  Clinical symptoms usually improve within two to three weeks, though a chronic relapsing form is recognised. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein is elevated to more than twice the upper limit of normal, with normal glucose and no pleocytosis. Bacterial cultures are negative and viral cultures rarely isolate anything. The dissociation between a high CSF protein, normal glucose and a lack of CSF cellular response in a person with an acute or subacute polyneuropathy is diagnostic of Guillain-Barré syndrome. MRI may be indicated to rule out spinal cord lesions, peripheral neuropathis and neuromuscular junction disorders. "
pediatrics,974,"A 7-year-old girl with allergy became acutely unwell while visiting a friend’s house and has been brought immediately to the emergency department. She is fully conscious but has got stridor, wheeze and erythematous rash. She is receiving oxygen. What is the single immediate management?",Check airway patency and prepare intubation,Give 0.25ml in 1000U epinephrine IM,Give 10mg chlorphearamine IM,Give 50ml hydrocortisone IM,Obtain secure IV access,B,Stridor is one of the indication of IM epinephrine in anaphylaxis
pediatrics,975,Which of the following statements applies to fragile X syndrome?,Affected children are taller than average,Cytogenetic finding of fragile X is induced in a vitamin B12 deficiency culture medium,Learning difficulties are found in all males,Learning difficulties are not found in females,The condition can only be diagnosed after birth,A,"Affected children are taller and may have high arched palate, long ears, a long face and macro orchidism. The diagnosis of fragile X syndrome was originally based on the expression of a folate-sensitive fragile X site (X q27.3) induced in cell culture under conditions of folate deprivation. Affected males usually, but not always, have learning difficulties. One third of females with the mutation have learning difficulties. Diagnosis can be made by detection of the mutant FMR 1 gene by chorionic villus sampling; confirmatory amniocentesis may be required in some cases."
pediatrics,976,A midwife calls you to see a newborn baby who she thinks has abnormal-looking genitalia. You examine the baby and indeed think the child has ambiguous genitalia. The parents had been under the impression the baby was male from the anomaly scan and were planning on calling him David. What should you tell the parents about the gender of their baby?,Await a review by endocrinologists and urologists before assigning gender to their baby,Explain their baby is a boy,Explain their baby is a girl,Send blood for karyotyping and assign gender according to their genetic makeup,Tell the parents the anomaly scan was wrong,A,"In any baby where gender is questionable, a senior review from an SpR or preferably a consultant is required. This is not expected to be dealt with merely by the SHO and in some infants undergoing a true salt wasting crisis may necessitate admission to the neonatal unit.  It is vital that gender is not assigned until a variety of tests are performed and a review by a team of endocrinologists and urologists is completed.  Gender is assigned based on the karyotype, the physical appearance and what external genitalia can be surgically formed given the existing appearance."
pediatrics,977,A healthy 2-year-old boy is brought to the emergency department having cut his hand playing in the garden. He has a 2 cm clean laceration. He has not received any routine immunizations as his parents are concerned about possible side effects. There are no contraindications to immunizations. What is the single most appropriate course of action?,Courses of DPT vaccine,Courses of DT,Single inj of DPT vaccine,Single inj of DT,Single inj of tetanus Ig,A,"The child is unimmunized and has no contraindication to vaccination. Keeping in mind his age, single injections would be useless and would not help the patient. Courses of DPT vaccine would be the best choice in this case"
pediatrics,978,You are called to the delivery room to resuscitate a term newborn baby with left diaphragmatic hernia diagnosed on antenatal scan. The baby is born with no respiratory effort. What is the next step in the management plan?,Five inflation breaths via ambu-bag,Intubation,Place on nasal CPAP with orogastric tube,Provide 50% oxygen via nasal cannula,Stimulation by rubbing the back,B,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a defect in the formation of the diaphragm (usually the left side), which allows the abdominal viscera to herniate into the chest. Severity is variable with some cases incompatible with life. Nevertheless, even mild cases will become worse if meticulous management is not provided. The main goal in managing CDH before surgery is to minimise air or fluid entry into the intestines, which might compress the lungs and lead to pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, ambu-bagging, nasal CPAP, or even spontaneous breathing will lead to the condition deteriorating. Ideally, any suspected case should be intubated in the delivery room. In some centres, patients are operated on immediately after birth if the baby is stable. "
pediatrics,979,"At 32/40 gestation a 1.73 kg female infant is born with Apgars of 3 at 1 minute and 6 at 5 minutes by spontaneous vaginal delivery. Mother had a pyrexia to 38.5°C in labour, and membranes were ruptured for 36 hours prior to delivery. On examination the temperature is 38.1°C. respiratory rate is 60/min, moderate recession. She requires ventilation at 18/4, 50% oxygen to maintain oxygen saturations at 92%. Heart rate is 150/min, poor peripheral perfusion, which improves with 10 ml/kg of normal saline. Chest x ray shows a bilateral ground glass appearance. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Congenital diaphragmatic hernia,Congenital pneumonia,Meconium aspiration,Surfactant-deficient lung disease,Transient tachypnoea of the newborn,B,"The history suggests immediate respiratory distress in a sick infant with several risk factors for infection - preterm, maternal fever, premature rupture of membranes (PROM). Congenital pneumonia (e.g. Group B streptococcal infection) is the most likely diagnosis. The respiratory distress and ground glass appearance overlap with surfactant-deficiency, but the risk factors make infection more likely. This is treated with intensive support and antibiotics (for example, penicillin and gentamicin or cefotaxime)."
pediatrics,980,"You are asked to see a 2-year-old girl who is brought into the Emergency department in the middle of the night after being found wandering alone in the street. When gaining consent to carry out a child protection examination, from whom can you gain authorisation?",Any adult family member if the child does not have capacity to give consent,Any patient who is aged 15 years or over,Consent must be gained from both parents if the child does not have capacity to give consent,The child's family doctor or health visitor,"The courts, for example, the family courts or the High Court",E,"The GMC have published guidance (Protecting children and young people: The responsibilities of all doctors) that sets out the child protection responsibilities of all doctors. This guidance states: andquot;You need consent or other legal authorisation to carry out any child protection examination, including a psychiatric or psychological assessment. You can get consent or authorisation from:  a child or young person who has the maturity and understanding to make the decision a person with parental responsibility if the child or young person does not have the capacity to give consent (it is usually enough to have consent from one person with parental responsibility) the courts - for example, the family courts or the High Court.  You must be satisfied that the person giving consent understands the purpose of the examination and what it will involve. This includes whether photographs or other images will be taken and how the results of the examination might be used - for example, as evidence in court. You must explain to the person that they have the right to refuse consent, and what may happen if they do this. You must record the discussion in the child or young person's medical record.andquot;"
pediatrics,981,"A child puts a pea in his ear whilst having his dinner, and is taken to the paediatric Emergency department by his father. Otoscopy shows a green coloured object in the external auditory canal. What is the most appropriate approach to remove this?",Hook retraction,Magnetic probe,Irrigation,Suction,Syringing,D,"Suction with or without sedation is the most appropriate method in this case. Irrigation is contraindicated for soft objects, organic matter or seeds, which may swell when exposed to water. Syringing the ear is an option for many foreign bodies, providing that the tympanic membrane is not perforated. However, it should not be used for vegetable matter, since vegetable matter may swell in the presence of water. Use of any implement (such as a hook) that may push the pea further into the ear canal should be avoided. Use of a general anaesthetic for this sort of incident is too risky and magnetic probe would obviously be of no use here."
pediatrics,982,What condition would you expect to find in a child with right atrial isomerism?,Asplenia,Bilateral bi-lobed lungs,Multiple splenic nodules,Undescended testicles,XO karyotype,A,"Right or left atrial isomerisms are embryological development disturbances that affect the distribution of thoracic and abdominal organs. They tend to affect the heart, liver, and spleen. Right atrial isomerism is associated with asplenia and a midline liver, bilateral tri-lobed lungs, and cyanotic heart disease. Left atrial isomerism presents later in life with polysplenia (multiple splenic nodules) and bi-lobed lungs. They can both present with gut malrotation, total or partial anomalous pulmonary drainage, and Kartagener's syndrome. Undescended testicles are not a feature of either. XO karyotype is Turner's syndrome, which is not related. "
pediatrics,983,A 6-year-old child presents with history of recurrent jaundice. Between the episodes he is totally fine. Mother gives history of jaundice being brought about by ongoing infections. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hereditary spherocytosis,G6PD deficiency,Thalassemia,Sickle cell disease,Congenital storage disorder,B,There are some precipitating factors of hemolysis causing jaundice in patients with G6PD deficiency among which infection is a recognized one
pediatrics,984,Which of the following forms of encephalitis is caused by a neuroimmunological response?,Cytomegalovirus,Enteral viruses,Herpes simplex,HIV infection,Measles,E,"Encephalitis may be caused by:  Direct invasion by a neurotoxic virus (encephalitis) Post-infectious encephalopathy: delayed brain swelling because of an immunological response to the antigen, i.e. a neuroimmunological response Slow virus infection, for example, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE).  Direct infection is most commonly caused by enteral viruses, herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, varicella, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is also occasionally caused by respiratory viruses, human herpes virus 6 (HHV6), rubella or mumps. A post-infectious illness may also be caused by measles or varicella zoster (cerebellar ataxia).

pediatrics,985,You are examining a 6-week-old infant in the community for their newborn check. As part of the examination you will be examining the hips. When you do so you notice that the femoral head slips into the hip socket with a clunk.  Which of the following is said to be positive?,Barlow's test,Galeazzi sign,Klisic test,Ortolani manoeuvre,Trendelenburg's sign,D,"It is vital that you understand the thinking behind the tests carried out when examining for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Barlow's test assesses the potential for dislocation of a non-displaced hip. It is said to be positive if the hip is felt to slide out of the hip socket. Galeazzi sign occurs when there is asymmetry of the thigh and gluteal skin folds. Klisic test is when you place your third finger over the greater trochanter and your index finger of the same hand on the anterior superior spine, in a normal hip an imaginary line drawn between the two fingers points towards the umbilicus. Ortolani's manoeuvre attempts to reduce a dislocated hip. It is said to be positive if the femoral head slips in the socket with a clunk. Trendelenburg's sign is seen only in walking infants and the child will walk with a waddling gait and toe walk on the affected side."
pediatrics,986,"A 9-month-old boy presents with an acute scrotal swelling, which you cannot get above and does not transilluminate. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?",Acute idiopathic scrotal oedema,Epididymitis,Irreducible inguinal hernia,Orchitis,Torsion of the testicular appendage,C,"With any acute swollen scrotum, the fear is of torsion of testis. This is uncommon in the neonate, and is much commoner around puberty. Presentation is with a hard tender testis and spermatic cord -/+ a red scrotum. Torsion of the appendage of testis has a peak incidence of between 4 and 8 years of age, as does acute idiopathic scrotal oedema. In the former, there is a tender upper pole of testis with a blue spot on transillumination. In the latter, the erythema extends beyond the scrotum, and the testis is minimally tender. Epididymitis is rare before puberty, and presents with a tender epididymus (urological investigations are needed, as it is associated with reflux of infected urine via the vas deferens). Inguinal herniae that are irreducible have a peak incidence below 2 years of age. A firm immobile tender swelling is found in the scrotum, which becomes inflamed as the strangulation occurs. Occasionally, acute hydroceles can also present with a mobile blue transilluminating swelling at 1-3 years of age. "
pediatrics,987,A 3-year-old boy presents because his parents are concerned he is not hearing normally as he often andquot;ignoresandquot; them when he is spoken to. He has mildly delayed speech and on examination his eardrum is inverted and cloudy. What is the best treatment option?,Antibiotics to prevent secondary infection,Autoinflation (nose balloon),Topical steroids,Urgent surgery to prevent irreversible speech and language delay,Watchful waiting,E,"This boy has glue ear. Fifty per cent of cases of glue ear will resolve within three months and 90% within a year so watchful waiting is the best course of action. Glue ear is the build up of fluid in the middle ear and causes a conduction deafness. Antibiotics, topical steroids and decongestants have all failed to show an improvement in symptoms. The majority of cases will resolve spontaneously and surgery should be reserved for those cases that do not improve spontaneously and are associated with moderate bilateral hearing loss. Relative indications for surgery include the presence of another condition that delays speech and language development, for example Down's syndrome, autism and blindness."
pediatrics,988,"A 9-year-old boy presents with a history of headache and persistent green nasal discharge. At night he has a cough and snores loudly. The headache is exacerbated by leaning forwards. On examination he is apyrexial, but has a persistent nasal obstruction and nasal speech. He is tender over the maxillae and forehead. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic rhinitis,Cluster headache,Cystic fibrosis,Nasal polyp,Sinusitis,E,"The picture is one of upper airways obstruction associated with nasal discharge, most likely due to sinusitis. In this case the maxillary and frontal sinuses are most likely to be involved, as this correlates with the patient's facial tenderness. Sinusitis is an inflammation of the membranous lining of the sinuses, which results in cavity obstruction and infection. It can accompany upper respiratory tract infections, allergy and asthma; smoking and diabetes are among many predisposing factors. Symptoms include:  facial discomfort nasal congestion and discharge reduced sense of smell nasal speech, and headache.  Treatment is usually aimed at symptoms (paracetamol, ibuprofen and nasal decongestants), with antibiotics being reserved for those with prolonged disease."
pediatrics,989,Which of the following is associated with abnormalities of phosphorylation of gene product by cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) binding of gene product to transcription factors such as E2F?,Achondroplasia,Huntington disease,Marfan syndrome,Neurofibromatosis type 1,Retinoblastoma,E,"The retinoblastoma gene product is phosphorylated by a CDK and then binds to transcription factors.

The incidence is 1 in 4000. The condition is associated with umbilical herniae and not inguinal herniae. Intellectual function and cognitive development may be impaired if the condition remains untreated or in cases of severe cretinism, which is rare. The rate of linear growth is retarded in this condition and is always less than weight gain."
pediatrics,991,"A 12-year-old patient recently discharged from the hospital with extensive burns, now presents to the Emergency department with fever, muscle pain, headache and diarrhoea of two days duration. Examination of the child reveals an ill-appearing boy with altered mental status, with a temperature of 39°C, HR 130 bpm, RR 35bpm, BP 85/55 mmHg. Healing burns are seen along with diffuse erythema of the skin and mucous membranes and conjunctival injection. What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",Kawasaki disease,Leptospirosis,Measles,Meningococcal septicaemia,Toxic shock syndrome,E,"This patient has toxic shock syndrome (TSS). It has been associated with burns, cutaneous and subcutaneous infections, abortions and tampon use. TSS can be caused by several bacteria, commonly Staph aureus or Strep pyogenes. The exact clinical features vary according to the causative organism. The diagnosis is suspected if these five features are found:  Fever Diffuse rash Desquamation one to two weeks after the onset Hypotension Organ involvement - must include three or more of the following:  Gastrointestinal symptoms Muscular symptoms, such as myalgias Mucous membrane involvement such as conjunctival hyperaemia Vaginal or oropharyngeal involvement Hepatic dysfunction Renal dysfunction Platelet count less than 100,000 Central nervous system dysfunction such as altered mental status.    The diagnosis should be confirmed where possible with blood and fluid cultures to confirm the infection and exclude other organisms.  Meningococcal septicaemia may present with fever and hypoperfusion, rash is non-blanching and petechial in nature, not diffuse erythroderma. Kawasaki disease may present with erythema of mucous membranes, erythematous polymorphous rash, and fever. Peak age of onset is 18-24 months. The disease is unusual in those older than 10 years. Leptospirosis is an acute infectious vasculitis, which is caused by spirochaetes. The initial phase of the disease is associated with fever, headache and malaise, followed by decrease of fever. The second phase of the disease is associated with appearance of fever, uveitis and signs of CNS inflammation. The rash may be erythematous but diffuse erythroderma is not characteristic. Measles is associated with 3 Cs:  Cough Coryza, and Conjunctivitis.  There is also a fever and a maculopapular rash which becomes confluent."

What is the most important element of management?",Assess area of injury,Assess depth of injury,Check 'At Risk' Register,Cool affected area,Start analgesia,E,"The history is typical of accidental thermal injury. The source of heat should be removed. By 30 minutes any hot liquid will have cooled. Analgesia is essential. The extent of injury should then be carefully marked on a burns chart to calculate the percentage of skin surface affected. The degree of injury should be assessed:  first degree is superficial second degree is partial thickness, and third degree is full thickness.  The first two are very painful, the last painless. Referral to a burns unit is necessary if the child is under 5 years, the lesion is greater than 2%, or if it affects a vital area (for example, flexure, face)."

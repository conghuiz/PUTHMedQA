nervous system,1,Which of the following can safely be given to epileptic patients?,Chloroquine,Ciprofloxacin,Doxycycline,Mefloquine,Metronidazole,C,"Doxycycline is an acceptable alternative for malaria prophylaxis. It is suitable for short term use and has the additional advantage of protecting against rickettsial infections, plague and leptospirosis. Chloroquine should only be used with caution as it reduces seizure threshold. Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones should be used with caution in epilepsy as they lower seizure threshold and may induce convulsions. Mefloquine is contraindicated in epileptics. In the normal population there is a 1 in 10,000 chance of serious neuropsychiatric complications. The risk is greater in epileptics. Metronidazole may reduce the seizure threshold. This risk is increased in renal failure."
nervous system,2,"A 29-year-old teacher is involved in a tragic RTA (road traffic accident). After that incident, he has been suffering from nightmares and avoided driving on the motorway. He has been diagnosed with PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder). What is the most appropriate management?",CBT,Diazepam,Citalopram,Dosalepin,Olanzepin,A,"CBT is the treatment of choice in PTSD. NICE recommends that you are offered 8–12 regular sessions of around 60–90 minutes, seeing the same therapist at least once a week"
nervous system,3,Which of the following is true of obsessional neurosis (obsessive compulsive disorder)?,Low intelligence is a common feature,Patients have good insight,Patients often act on their aggressive impulses,The onset is usually after the age of 50 years,There is often a history of faulty toilet training,B,"Obsessional neurosis is associated with rituals, fears (for example, hurting others but rarely carried out), thoughts abhorrent to the patient and ruminations. Patients maintain insight and often find the illness distressing (which can lead to depression). Obsessional compulsive disorder typically starts in early adult life and has equal sex incidence. The intelligence of patients is often above average. Sigmund Freud postulated that obsessive compulsive symptoms were caused by rigid toilet-training practices, however this theory is no longer widely accepted."
nervous system,4,A 17-year-old student presented with recurrent attacks of dizziness. Which one of the following additional features is most suggestive that she has an anxiety disorder?,Elevated diastolic blood pressure,Nocturia,Paraesthesia in the hands,Rotational vertigo,Tinnitus,C,"Paraesthesia is often experienced with hyperventilation associated with anxiety disorders and is often in hands, feet and peri-orally. Rotational vertigo and tinnitus suggest an organic disorder, whilst anxiety disorder may be associated with raised systolic blood pressure, but not diastolic"
nervous system,5,"A 43-year-old woman presents with low mood, loss of libido, sleep disturbance, tiredness, palpitation, chest discomfort, irritability and recurrent worries. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Seasonal Affective Disorder,Moderate depression,Dysthymia,Generalized anxiety disorder,Bipolar disorder,B,Mild depression: i)Low mood ii) Anhedonia iii) Guilt iv) Hopelessness v) Worthlessness vi) Inability to concentrate. Treatment is CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) Moderate depression: Features of mild + vii) Poor sleep viii) Poor Appetite ix) Poor libido x) Easy fatiguability. Treatment is Antidepressants
nervous system,6,"You are asked to review a 35-year-old man who was transferred from a psychiatric ward a week ago with unexplained pyrexia. Nurses say he is deteriorating: on examination he has reduced conscious level, a temperature of 38.5°C, BP 90/50 mmHg, pulse 110 bpm. There is generalised muscle stiffness but no neck stiffness and no focal neurology. Basic screening bloods in the Emergency department show mild leucocytosis and dehydration with CRP 50. The rest of the FBC and biochemistry including liver function tests are essentially normal. Infection screen - including CXR, mid-stream urine (MSU) and blood cultures - is negative. Which of the following would be the best investigation to perform next?",Brain CT (computerised tomography),Creatine kinase (CK),Lumbar puncture,Repeat blood culture,"Sputum m, c and s (microscopy, culture and sensitivity)",B,"The history is strongly suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. This is an idiopathic drug reaction associated with initiation or adjustment of neuroleptic medication, particularly dopamine blockers such as antipsychotics. Primary diagnostic features are altered conscious level, autonomic instability and muscular rigidity with raised creatine kinase (CK). A CK level can give an answer within a matter of hours: given the history of muscular rigidity, it should be the next investigation. A CT is unlikely to give a useful answer in the absence of focal neurology. The remaining incorrect options are reasonable investigations in the situation but will all take time, it would be hard to justify their priority over a simple test like a CK."
nervous system,7,A 68 year old female is brought to her GP by her husband. He states she has become very forgetful of late and is unable to concentrate. He has also noticed over the last few months that she is incontinent of urine and has been walking in an unusual way. On examination there is evidence of gait apraxia and her reflexes are brisk. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Lewy Body Dementia,Parkinsons Disease,Picks Disease,Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus,Alzheimers Disease,D,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus is the most likely diagnosis as it presents with the triad of dementia, gait abnormalities and urinary incontinence.  There is no other features to suggest Parkinsons disease or Lewy body dementia and the other diagnoses do not account for all the signs and symptoms. In NPH there is ventricular enlargement without an increase in intracranial pressure. A CT or MRI will reveal ventricular dilatation. A large volume lumbar puncture is useful for the diagnosis. Neuropsychology and physiotherapy assessment are performed before and after a large volume of CSF is drawn off and if there is an improvement in these parameters then this is highly indicative. Medical management with acetozolamide and repeated lumbar puncture are useful however a CSF shunt is a more definitive management."
nervous system,8,A lesion of the facial nerve in the internal auditory meatus will affect which of the following?,Accommodation,Lacrimation,Sensation over the cheek,Sweating over the cheek,"Taste, on the posterior third of tongue",B,"The extent of dysfunction depends on the level of injury of the facial nerve. If injury is proximal to geniculate ganglion, for examplein the internal auditory meatus, taste is lost in the anterior two thirds of the tongue. Also secretion from submandibular, sublingual and lacrimal glands is impaired. Hyperacusis is due to paralysis of stapedius. The orbicularis oculi is affected, causing inability to blink or close eyelids. Sensation over the face is supplied by the trigeminal nerve, and sweat glands are controlled by the sympathetic nervous system (e.g. anhydrosis in Horner's syndrome)."
nervous system,9,Mutation in which of the following is associated with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?,Collagen type 1 gene,FGFR3 gene,Fibrillin- gene,FMR-1 gene,Type II procollagen gene,A,"Mutations in the following genes cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome:  ADAMTS2 COL1A1 COL1A2 COL3A1 COL5A1 COL5A2 PLOD1 TNXB.  Ehlers-Danlos occurs in 1:5000 people worldwide. In view of the wide number of mutations that can cause Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, this is a very heterogeneous condition.  FGFR3 is implicated in achondroplasia Fibrillin gene in Marfan's syndrome and FMR-1 gene fragile X learning difficulties 1."
nervous system,10,"A 43-year-old man with a history of hospital admissions talk about various topics, moving from one loosely connected topic to another. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Psychosis,Mania,Schizophrenia,Pressured speech,Verbal diarrhea,B,Flight of idea is common in mania
nervous system,11,A 21-year-old male is admitted with severe acute onset headache. He is disoriented and drowsy and has neck stiffness. Investigations suggest a diagnosis of subarachnoid haemorrhage. What grade of illness does this patient have on the Hunt and Hess scale?,Grade 1,Grade 2,Grade 3,Grade 4,Grade 5,C,"This gentleman's history is suggestive of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). The Hunt and Hess scale grades SAH thus:  Asymptomatic or minimal headache andamp; slight neck stiffness Moderate or severe headache with neck stiffness, but no neurological deficit other than cranial nerve palsy Drowsiness with confusion or mild focal neurology Stupor with moderate to severe hemiparesis or mild decerebrate rigidity Deeply comatose with severe decerebrate rigidity.  Severity and mortality increase with grade. "
nervous system,12,A 24-year-old male on remand in prison for murder is referred by the prison doctor. He is noted to be behaving oddly whilst in prison and complains of seeing things. He has a previous history of IV drug abuse. On questioning he provides inappropriate but approximate answers to all questions stating that Bill Clinton is the prime minister of England. What is the prisoner suffering from?,Capgras syndrome,Cotard syndrome,Ganser syndrome,Ekbom syndrome,Tourette’s syndrome,C,"Ganser syndrome is characterized by nonsensical or wrong answers to questions or doing things incorrectly often with visual pseudohallucinations and a decreased state of consciousness. It is also sometimes called prison psychosis, because the syndrome occurs most frequently in prison inmates, where it may represent an attempt to gain leniency from prison or court officials"
nervous system,13,Which of the following is FALSE regarding tardive dyskinesia?,Facial writhing and grimacing is a common feature,Can be caused by metoclopramide,Clozapine is less likely to cause tardive dyskinesia than haliperidol,It occurs within days of antipsychotic treatment,If it occurs it may be permanent,D,Tardive dyskinesia is a movement disorder that occurs from long term exposure to antipsychotics and some other medications that effect neurotransmitters.
nervous system,14,"A 47-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Department in a disoriented state. He lives alone and was recently released from a psychiatric institution. He has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and is treated with lithium. His friends, who had brought him, could not tell anything more about his addiction habits but he was known to be an occasional drinker. Recently, his GP had started him on hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension. On examination, the man was disoriented and there were stains of vomitus on his shirt. His hands were trembling. His eyes were sunken and blood pressure was 90/70 mm of Hg. From the information given, which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Activated charcoal,Hemodialysis,Iv dextrose with thiamine,Psychiatric evaluation,Sodium bicarbonate,B,"This man presents with features of lithium toxicity. He has disorientation with nausea and vomiting and tremor of hands. The addition of a diuretic on lithium has led to this toxicity. The man is also dehydrated, as evident from the clinical features like hypotension. Dehydration also precipitates Li toxicity. The best treatment for Li toxicity is hemodialysis or hemofiltration. Lithium does not bind to activated charcoal. Thus, its use is not helpful. Moreover, as lithium toxicity causes vomiting, charcoal may be aspirated. This is not a case of chronic alcoholism. Hence, dextrose with thiamine will not help. Psychiatric evaluation and readjustment of the doses of drugs will be needed but it is not a first step. Sodium bicarbonate may cause alkaline diuresis, which theoretically may remove lithium from the body. But its action is unpredictable and it may also cause hypokalemia. Thus, it is not preferred."
nervous system,15,"A 69 year old female presents with arm weakness, left worse than right. She has also had some difficulty walking. She has had trouble intermittently with neck pain for many years. On examination there is evidence of 4/5 power in the left arm with evidence of wasting. There is loss of the supinator, biceps and triceps reflex. There is evidence of a spastic gait, increased tone, hyperreflexia and upgoing plantars. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cervical Myelopathy,Motor Neurone Disease,Syringomyelia,Cervical Radiculopathy,Multiple Sclerosis,A,"The finding of UMN signs in the lower limbs and LMN signs in the arms with history of neck pain, most likely secondary to cervical spondylosis, makes the most likely diagnosis cervical myelopathy."
nervous system,16,A 49 year old woman presents with unilateral hearing loss and shooting pain in right side of face.  Audiometry reveals a right sided sensorineural hearing loss. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Long QT syndrome,Otitis Media,Acoustic neurinoma,Trigeminal neuralgia,Perforated Ear drum,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Acoustic neuroma and this must be excluded in any patient with a unilateral sensorineural hearing loss.  Perforated eardrum and otitis media will not cause the facial pain and although this is a feature of trigeminal neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia would not lead to the hearing loss.  Long QT syndrome can be associated with deafness but this would be identified at a much earlier age."
nervous system,17,"A 36-year-old woman has recently spent a lot of money on buying clothes. She goes out almost every night with her friends. She believes that she knows better than her friends, so she should choose the restaurant for eating out. She gave history of having low mood at 12 years ago. What’s the diagnosis?",Mania,Depression,Bipolar affective disorder,Borderline personality disorder,Dysthymia,C,Initial depressive episode (may be befor a long) followed by mania is bipolar affective disorder
nervous system,18,A 72-year-old male presented with a homonymous quadrantanopia. Which of the following conditions is most likely to cause such a presentation?,A lesion of the occipital cortex,A lesion of the optic chiasma,Bilateral diabetic retinopathy,Chloroquine poisoning,Tobacco amblyopia,A,"Unilateral occipital lobe lesions (left or right) cause contralateral hemianopsia or quadrantanopsia, visual agnosia, visual illusions and elementary visual hallucinations. Left occipital lobe lesions cause these symptoms and alexia and colour agnosia. Right occipital lobe lesions cause impaired visual orientation and topographical memory in addition. Bioccipital lesions are rare, but cause cortical blindness, altitudinal hemianopsia, impaired colour perception, Anton syndrome and prosopagnosia. A lesion of the optic chiasm would cause a bitemporal hemianopia. Diabetic retinopathy can rarely cause an 'apparent quadrantic hemianopia' because the distribution of the retinal changes may just correspond to quadrantic hemianopia - but this is not the most likely. Tobacco amblyopia causes symmetric central or centrocaecal scotomas. Chloroquine poisoning causes symmetric bilateral scotomas."
nervous system,19,A 24 year old female has been being treated for depression and anxiety. She now presents with worsening of her mood and memory difficulties. She has noticed pain in her legs and feeling her legs jerking. You notice she has an ataxic gait and some odd choreiform movements and occasional myoclonic jerks. She is referred for an MRI which shows high signal in the posterior thalamus.  An EEG reveals no abnormalities.  What is the likely diagnosis?,New variant Creutzfeldt Jakob disease,Depression,Sporadic Creutzfeldt Jakob disease,Huntingtons Chorea,Picks Disease,A,"The most likely diagnosis is new variant CJD due to the findings of myoclonic jerks, cognitive impairment and abnormal neurological features.  It often presents initially psychiatric symptoms followed by neurological features, such as ataxia and myoclonus, unlike sporadic CJD which more often presents with neurological features and is rapidly progressive. The MRI findings described are common and useful for differentiating from sporadic CJD.  EEG is normal unlike sporadic.  Depression would not cause the neurological features.  Picks Disease is a frontotemporal dementia."
nervous system,20,"A 30-year-old woman has had a head injury. Her GCS is 14. The nurse looking after the patient calls you back to see her 30 minutes later. The GCS is now 10. She has a dilated pupil, is vomiting and confused. Which is the most likely source of bleeding?",Basillar artery,Berry aneurysm,Intrinsic cerebral vessels,Middle meningeal artery,Sigmoid sinus,D,Extradural haematomas most commonly occur from arterial haemorrhage into the potential space superficial to the dura. The bleeding is usually due to injury to the middle meningeal artery in the temporal area. Patients with extradural haematoma are commonly known to andquot;talk and dieandquot; because they usually have a lucid phase followed by rapid deterioration.
nervous system,21,A 72-year-old man with long-standing Parkinson's comes to the surgery. He is maintained on high-dose l-dopa therapy but is suffering significant on/off phenomena. This is really affecting his life and he feels unable to leave the house and go on excursions with his wife. Other past history of note includes prostatism for which he takes an alpha-blocker and a 5-alpha reductase inhibitor. He has also suffered a myocardial infarction some five years earlier. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate next therapeutic option for him?,Amitriptyline,Cabergoline,Change to soluble levodopa before meals,Entacapone,Selegiline,B,"On/off phenomena may be considerably improved either by the addition of cabergoline (a dopamine agonist) or a subcutaneous infusion of apomorphine. Liquid forms of l-dopa may also be helpful as they allow closer titration of dose, and splitting meals into smaller snacks and one larger evening meal also affects the pharmacokinetics (PK) of l-dopa positively."
nervous system,22,A man presents to his GP on the insistence of his girlfriend. He was in a motorcycle accident in which another friend died 4 months previous and since then he has been low in mood and now hears the voice of his dead mother. He has lost 8 kilos in weight. Examination and blood tests reveal nothing. What is the likely diagnosis?,Bipolar disorder,Post concussion syndrome,Psychotic depression,Post traumatic stress disorder,Adjustment disorder,C,"Psychotic depression is characterised by low mood, anhedonia, delusions and hallucinations. Adjustment disorder cannot be diagnosed if there has been a recent bereavement. Post traumatic stress disorder is unlikely due to the hallucinations and post concussion syndrome is characterised by a headache, dizziness and psychological symptoms such as anxiety or depression."
nervous system,23,"A 35-year-old woman presents with shortness of breath, palpitations and anxiety. The episodes have been occurring over three years, but are worse recently. The episodes occur at stressful periods and are also related to difficult tasks at work. There is no history of drug or alcohol abuse. What is the most appropriate pharmacological management for this patient?",Alprazolam,Chlorpromazine,Clomipramine,Paroxetine,Promethazine,D,"This patient most likely has generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). The central feature is excessive worry about a number of different events, associated with heightened tension. Concomitant anxiety and depressive disorders are common and should be looked for. The goal of intervention should be remission (complete resolution of symptoms), which is associated with better functioning and a lower likelihood of relapse. Such interventions are used in a stepwise fashion:  Step one should be used for all patients with GAD. It involves early identification and assessment of cases, with education about GAD and treatment options and active monitoring. Step two is used for cases of diagnosed GAD that have not improved after education and active monitoring. Patients should be offered individual non-facilitated self-help or guided self-help and psychoeducational groups. Step three is used for those patients where there is marked functional impairment or cases which have not improved after step two interventions. Patients should be offered an individual high-intensity psychological intervention (CBT or applied relaxation) or a drug treatment (SSRI).  Verbal and written information should be provided on the likely benefits and disadvantages, and the choice of treatment based on the person's preference (unless there is evidence that one mode of treatment is superior in the individual case). Sertraline has been shown to be the most cost-effective drug but all SSRIs (or SNRIs) can be considered. Pregabalin can be used when patients an intolerant of SSRIs or SNRIs. Benzodiazepines should not be used except as a short-term measure during crises. Antipsychotics are also not used. Patients who fail to adequately respond to step three interventions or those with a risk of self-harm or a significant comorbidity should be referred for specialist treatment. "
nervous system,24,A 52-year-old man presents with visual hallucinations and features of cognitive impairment. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Frontotemporal dementia,Lewy body dementia,Delirium tremens,Alzheimer’s disease,Huntington’s disease,B,Visual hallucinations and cognitive impairment are suggestive of Lewy body dementia. Hallucination is prominent feature of LBD than Alzheimers. Again cognitive impairment goes more with LBD while prominent early memory loss symptom suggests Alzheimer’s
nervous system,25,"A fit 80-year-old woman has eight hours of an acutely ischaemic right arm with severe pain in the hand and fingers. She is right handed. She had no pain or restricted movement prior to this event. She has atrial fibrillation, for which she has takes digoxin. Her right hand is very cold and pale but some movement and sensation are preserved. There is a good axillary artery pulse but distal pulses are impalpable. Which is the most appropriate immediate management?",A CT angiogram,An urgent duplex arterial scan,Embolectomy,Therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH),Thrombolysis,C,This woman has an acute arterial occlusion. Upper limb ischaemia is most commonly due to emboli followed by trauma. Atherosclerotic occlusions are rare. Whilst the hand is currently viable it will not remain so for long. It is likely that the embolus will have lodged at the level of the brachial artery and so surgical exploration and embolectomy using a Fogarty catheter is the correct treatment. Intraoperative thrombolysis may help lyse the distal material not removed by the catheter.
nervous system,26,"A 29 year old woman complains of headaches, upset stomach, jaw pain, sore muscles and difficulty sleeping. Full examination reveals no medical issues. She doesnt accept that nothing was found during the investigations and seeks a second opinion. What is the diagnosis?",Personality disorder,Conversion disorder,Somatisation disorder,Psychosis,Hypochondriac,C,"Somatisation disorder is a diagnosis of exclusion in which multiple symptoms are found to have no physical cause. The symptoms are often vague and occur in different systems. The patient normally has a previous diagnosis of mental illness, the symptoms started before the age of 30 and usually will have rejected other professionals advice. The main difference between this and malingering is that malingerers choose to produce the symptoms to receive a conscious benefit from the illness. It is thought to be a way of dealing with stress as it is more common in people that have underwent traumatic experiences. Treatment is with CBT and antidepressants."
nervous system,27,"A 24-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department by police. He is dressed in biblical style, and was found outside an old people's home, trying to gain access to heal the residents. He believes he is Jesus and is able to cure any movement disorders which they possess. Accident and Emergency records suggest that he has been admitted twice in the past three years with hypomanic episodes, and was transferred on each occasion to the psychiatric ward for a 1 month stay. Examination reveals a BP of 125/75, pulse is 85 and regular. He is agitated and refuses examination, telling you he is the Messiah and doesn't need human medicine. A drug screen is positive for amphetamines and cocaine. Which of the following describes his belief in healing powers?",Hallucination,Illusion,Monothematic delusion,Polythematic delusion,Pseudo-hallucination,C,"The answer is Monothematic delusion. This patient has a fixed belief that he has healing powers, and wants to use these to help old people walk. There is no evidence of other delusional behaviour apart from his belief that as the Messiah, he can heal people, in that sense this could be described as a monothematic delusion. These beliefs occur in conjunction with a manic episode, almost certainly against a background of bipolar disease, coupled with stimulant drug abuse. Polythematic delusions are different, spanning a number of different themes, and are more commonly seen in schizophrenia versus bipolar disease. Hallucinations are sensory perceptions experienced despite there being no external stimulus. Patients with pseudohallucinations are aware of a stimulus which they realise is in their mind, such as hearing a voice. This differentiates them from hallucinations, which can be localised outside the body. An illusion is mis-interpretation of a physical stimulus, for instance noise from a dog barking sounding like a baby crying. Monothematic delusions, such as belief in healing powers are commonly seen in patients with bipolar disorder, both in manic and depressive episodes."
nervous system,28,A 22-year-old man says that he can hear the voice of his deceased uncle telling him that he is being spied on. The patient is distressed by this becoming low in mood and anxious and has not left the house for 2 weeks. He is starting to drink increasing quantities of alcohol. He is noticed to have thought-block and passivity phenomena. What is the single most suitable medicine to treat his symptom?,Diazepam,Disulfiram,Fluoxetine,Lithium,Olanzapine,E,"Auditory hallucination, social withdrawal, thought block are features of schizophrenia. So olanzapine is the drug to be prescribed from the given option"
nervous system,29,"A 65-year-old woman says she died 3 months ago and is very distressed that nobody has buried her. When she is outdoors, she hears people say that she is evil and needs to be punished. What is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?",Schizophrenia,Mania,Psychotic depression,Hysteria,Toxic confusional state,C,"Psychotic depression, also known as depressive psychosis, is a major depressive episode that is accompanied by psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions). In this patient nihilistic delusion favours the diagnosis of psychotic depression. It can occur in the context of bipolar disorder or majordepressive disorder"
nervous system,30,A patient presents with features of Bipolar disorder. Which of the following should be utilised as a mood stabiliser?,Olanzapine,Lithium,Risperidone,Citalopram,Quetiapine,B,Lithium is utilised in bipolar disorder as a mood stabiliser. Valproate is an alternative. In those who are acutely manic and who are not on a mood stabiliser then antipsychotics can be utilised but are not as effective as mood stabilisers. Citalopram is useful in depressive episodes not in manic and not as a mood stabiliser.
nervous system,31,"A 68 year old man is agitated and is suffering from insomnia during a hospital admission for an elective operation. He is very sensitive to noise and bright lights, and complains of sore muscles. He has a long history of anxiety and controlled hypertension. Examination and blood results are normal. What is the most likely problem?",Sepsis,Anxiety,PTSD,Anaesthetic reaction,Benzodiazepine withdrawal,E,"Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome describes the clinical picture of someone withdrawing from benzodiazepines that have dependence. It is characterised by agitation, sensitivity to light and sound, insomnia and sore muscles. The onset of symptoms depends on the half life of the drug used. Serious cases of withdrawal can cause seizures with a high mortality rate."
nervous system,32,Which symptom is more common with haloperidol when compared to olanzapine?,Increased incidence of diabetes,Weight gain,Akathisia,Delusions,Auditory hallucinations,C,"Haloperidol, a typical antipsychotic, is much more likely to cause extra pyramidal side effects than olanzapine, an atypical antipsychotic."
nervous system,33,"A 53-year-old woman presented with pain in the eye, blurry vision and clumsiness for 3 months. She has a history of difficulty in swallowing and weakness in her right upper limb 2 years ago. What is the investigation of choice?",CSF analysis,EEG,EMG,MRI brain,Visual evoked response test,D,Diagnosis is multiple sclerosis for which gadolinium enhanced T2 weighted MRI is the investigation of choice
nervous system,34,A patient with a 6 month history of low mood and some suicidal thoughts is discussing her treatment options. Which of the following is the best pharmacological treatment?,Lorazepam,Fluoxetine,Amitriptyline,Haloperidol,Selegiline,B,Selective Seretonin Reuptake Inhibitors such as fluoxetine or citalopram are the standard first line of treatment for depression. They have low toxicity and are considered to be effective. Amitriptyline should be avoided due to its toxicity.
nervous system,35,"A 40-year-old chronic alcoholic who lives alone, brought in the emergency department having been found confused at home after a fall. He complains of a headache and gradually worsening confusion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Head injury,Hypoglycemia,Extradural hematoma,Subdural hematoma,Delirium,D,"subdural hematoma may be acute or chronic. In chronic symptoms may not be apparent for several days or weeks. Symptoms of subdural hematomas are: fluctuating level of consciousness, ± insidious physical or intellectual slowing, sleepiness, headache, personality change and unsteadiness. Treatment: Irrigation/evacuation e.g. via barr twist drill and barr hole craniostomy 1st line. Craniotomy if the clot organized 2nd line"
nervous system,36,"A patient involved in an accident finds that she is unable to taste sweet, salty or sour flavours. Which cranial nerve is most likely to be responsible for this sensory loss?",Accessory nerve,Glossopharyngeal nerve,Hypoglossal nerve,Olfactory nerve,Vagus nerve,B,"The facial nerve is responsible for the appreciation of taste sensation. The glossopharyngeal nerve supplies taste to the posterior 1/3 of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve along with the hypoglossal nerve innervates pharyngeal muscles. The olfactory nerve is associated with smell. The vagus nerve is involved with parasympathetic swallowing, etc. "
nervous system,37,Which is true of intercostal nerves?,Anteriorly they run in the costal groove on the upper margin of the rib,Each is connected to a ganglion of the sympathetic trunk,Innervate the pectoralis major,The eleventh intercostal nerve is also known as the subcostal nerve,They represent the dorsal rami of the thoracic spinal nerves,B,"The intercostal nerves represent the ventral rami of the first 11 thoracic spinal nerves and run along the costal groove on the lower margin of the rib. The twelfth, being below the 12th rib is subcostal, hence is called the subcostal nerve. Each intercostal nerve is connected to a ganglion of the sympathetic trunk by rami communicantes to and from which it carries preganglionic and postganglionic fibres which innervate blood vessels, sweat glands, and muscles. The pectoralis major muscle is innervated by the lateral and medial pectoral nerves."
nervous system,38,A 63 year old female has sudden onset bilateral weakness in her legs and urinary retention. She has a PMH of hypertension and is a heavy smoker.  On examination she has 4/5 weakness in both legs and has pain and temperature loss from the level of the  umbilicus over all dermatomes of her legs.  Other sensory modalities are unaffected.  Which of the following is the likely cause?,Stroke,Cauda Equina Syndrome,Syringomyelia,Anterior spinal artery occlusion,Spinal tumour,D,"The pyramidal and spinothalamic tracts are affected and these are situated in the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord which is supplied by the anterior spinal artery.  The posterior third is supplied by the posterior spinal artery and affects the dorsal column tract.  Gross touch, proprioception and vibration sense would be affected. Cauda Equina is not the cause as the sensory disturbance is affected up to T7.  Spinal tumour  and syringomyelia is feasible but these do not have an acute onset."
nervous system,39,A 70 year old female presents with paraesthesia in her feet.  On examination there is power 4/5 and there is absent ankle reflexes but hyperreflexia at the knees.  She has loss of joint position sensation and vibration but intact pain and temperature sensation. Om checking her recent bloods you note a macrocytic anaemia.  Given the likely diagnosis what would be seen on a spinal MRI?,Nil of note,Increased signal in the posterior columns in T2 weighted imaging,Lesion in spinal cord,Increased signal in pyramidal tracts in T1 weighted imaging,Reduced signal in the posterior columns in T2 weighted imaging,B,The most likely underlying diagnosis is Vitamin B12 deficiency causing subacute combined degeneration of the cord leading to the above clinical findings.  An MRI usually shows increased signal on T2 weighted imaging especially in the posterior columns.
nervous system,40,A patient with long standing Rheumatoid arthritis presents with features of mononeuritis multiplex. There is also evidence of nail fold infarcts. Bloods reveal an elevated ESR and positive pANCA. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these clinical findings?,Wegener's Granulomatosis,AL Amyloidosis,AA amyloidosis,Diabetes,Rheumatoid Vasculitis,E,There is evidence of mononeuritis multiplex and nail fold infarcts suggestive of vasculitis. This along with the positivity of pANCA makes rheumatoid vasculitis the most likely cause. ANCA in RA is often associated with a more severe clinical course. The history is not suggestive of Wegener's granulomatosis and it is associated with cANCA not pANCA. Diabetes would not explain the nail fold infarcts. Amyloidosis tends to lead to a polyneuropathy and not mononeuritis multiplex and AL amyloidosis occurs in myeloma rather than RA.
nervous system,41,"A 24 year old female presents witnessed by a family member where she suddenly becomes unaware of her surroundings, is unresponsive and performs unusual lip smacking. She states she does not remember these attacks however remembers shortly before it a feeling of deja vu. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Complex partial seizure,Generalised tonic clonic seizure,Myoclonic seizure,Simple partial seizure,Absence seizure,A,"This history is highly suggestive of a complex partial seizure with the history of aura, lip smacking and loss of awareness. Carbamazepine, lamotrigine, sodium valproate, topiramate and oxcarbazepine are considered as first line agents."
nervous system,42,"A 32-year-old man visits his GP complaining that he is totally depressed and fixated by the loss of his wife and child who were killed by a hit and run driver around one year earlier. He says that he has taken to drinking large quantities of alcohol every day and occasionally even smoking heroin in an attempt to forget what happened and stop the memories of the event playing back in his mind. He cannot hold down a job because he finds it impossible to concentrate, is constantly irritable and hardly sleeps at night. He attends the clinic with his mother who tells you that he has not cried since the event. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for him?",Cognitive therapy,Diazepam,Mirtazapine,Paroxetine,Phenelzine,A,"This man has post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of the horrific event which led to the death of his wife and child. NICE guidelines on Depression in adults (CG90) support the use of trauma focussed cognitive behavioural therapy as the mainstay of therapy. Other options include:  Eye movement desensitisation Reprocessing and relaxation techniques.  Drug therapies are very much second line therapy for PTSD, although they may be of value in treating associated comorbitities such as depression, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) being recommended by NICE as first line drug therapy. Clinicians are warned, however, that increased agitation may lead to suicidal ideation during the first few weeks of treatment."

nervous system,44,"A 25-year-old male with learning difficulties presents with behavioural problems. He confessed to smoking the occasional cannabis joint to help his mood, and on deeper questioning reports he reports early morning waking with occasional suicidal thoughts. Which of the following is most likely to be the cause of his behavioural problems?",Cannabis,Dementia,Depression,Mania,Schizophrenia,C,"The presence of early morning waking, low mood and suicidal intent should make you consider depression. Patients with learning difficulties may find the low mood difficult to comprehend, and this can result in behavioural disturbance which might be alleviated with the use of antidepressant medications.  Occasional cannabis use as suggested here is not suggestive of the symptoms the patient is describing.  The patient also does not have any first rank symptoms suggesting Schizophrenia. Mani does not present with suicidal ideation and low mood rather pressured speech, loss of inhibition and grandiose thoughts."
nervous system,45,Which of the following is true of the intercostal nerves?,Pass superficial to the internal intercostal muscles,The collateral branch supplies the skin over the intercostal space.,The lower seven intercostal nerves also supply the skin of the abdomen,They innervate pectoralis major,They represent the ventral rami of the thoracic spinal nerves,E,"The intercostal nerves pass between the internal intercostal (deep to, not superficial) and transversus muscles. The collateral branch supplies muscles, parietal pleura and the periosteum of the ribs. The lateral cutaneous branch supplies the skin over the intercostal space. The lower five intercostal nerves supply the skin over the abdomen (the umbilicus is T10) The intercostal nerves represent the ventral rami of the first eleven thoracic spinal nerves. The twelfth (being below the twelfth rib) is subcostal, hence is called the subcostal nerve. Each intercostal nerve is connected to a ganglion of the sympathetic trunk by rami communicantes, to and from which they carry preganglionic and postganglionic fibres which innervate blood vessels, sweat glands, and muscles. Pectoralis major is supplied by the medial and lateral pectoral nerves (C6,7,8)"

There are differing severities depending on the number of repeats and the disease shows anticipation. It starts usually with grip myotonia and facial weakness, ptosis and wasting of muscles leading to thinning of the face and it then involves distal muscle groups. This progresses and it is associated with numerous other symptoms including cataracts, early frontal baldness, dysphagia, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias and respiratory failure. Respiratory failure may account for up to 40% of deaths due to myotonic dystrophy. In Becker's muscular dystrophy it is proximal muscle which are affected. In MND there is usually features of both upper and lower motor neurone signs and fasciculations. In myasthenia gravis there is fatiguability and ocular signs tend to be the first to present and proximal muscle groups are more predominantly affected. Duchenne's muscular dystrophy affects proximal muscles and presents at a young age."

On examination there is right facial nerve paralysis including the forehead, a vesicular rash in the right auditory canal and diminished taste sensation on the tongue.  There is nil else of note. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ramsay Hunt syndrome,Bells palsy,Stroke,Cerbellopontine tumour,Parotid tumour,A,With the finding of a vesicular rash and neurological findings then Ramsay Hunt Syndrome is the diagnosis.  Bells palsy would not cause ear pain or taste changes.  Cerbellopontine angle tumours would lead to hearing loss and often vertigo. Parotid tumour would not lead to ear pain and would be seen on examination.
nervous system,53,A patient had TIA (transient ishchemic attack) which he recovered from. He has a history of stroke and exam shows HR (heart rate) in sinus rhythm. He is already on aspirin 75mg and anti-hypertensive drugs. What other action should be taken?,Add clopidogrel only,Increase dose of aspirin to 300mg,Add warfarin,Add clopidogrel and statin,Add statin only,E,He who is already on aspirin needs no change in aspirin dose.Clopidogrel is now drug of choice for secondary prevention in TIA but if someone is already on aspirin he should continue it at same dose and should be considered to shift to clopidogrel in next few visits.

nervous system,57,"A 70-year-old man attends the neurology clinic with his wife. She is concerned as he is becoming increasingly drowsy in the day time, unsteady on his feet, has increasingly poor short term memory, seems unable to perform simple tasks and is suffering from visual hallucinations. The hallucinations include seeing people at the end of the bed or in the room. His GP has diagnosed Parkinson's disease and on Neurological recommendation started L-dopa, but it appears the hallucinations have got worse after the medication was started. On examination in the clinic his BP is 122/80 sitting, there is a drop of 10mmHg on standing. You note increased rigidity and poverty of facial expression, although tremor is minor, worse on the left than the right. He walks with short steps, stooped forward and with stiff legs. MMT is recorded as 15/30. His BMI is 22. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alzheimer's disease,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Lewy body dementia,Multi-infarct dementia,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,C,"The answer is Lewy body dementia, (LBD). The Parkinsonian symptoms coupled with sleep disturbance, memory loss and visual hallucinations fit well with a diagnosis of LBD. The fact that symptoms are made worse by prescription of L-dopa further supports the diagnosis. Neuroleptics should be avoided for managing psychotic symptoms as they can significantly worsen any underlying movement disorder. Cholinesterase inhibitors may be of value at high dose in limiting memory loss according to NICE guidelines.  The prominent Parkinsonian symptoms count against a diagnosis of Alzheimers or Multi-infarct dementia. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is most commonly seen in obese females, and presents with headaches but not usually other significant neurological signs. Normal pressure hydrocephalus classically presents with the triad of memory loss, gait disturbance and incontinence, rather than the Parkinsonian symptoms seen here."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Huntington disease,Picks disease,Lewy Body demetnia,Stroke,Alzheimers disease,B,"Picks disease is a progressive frontotemporal dementia characterised by the presence of tau and ubiquitin proteins in the degenerating cells and has no known cause. It causes behavioural and personality changes such as lethargy, disinhibition, and apathy. It also causes a loss of executive function and memory but these occur AFTER the personality change.  An MRI shows increased T2 signal in the frontal lobe white matter and frontal lobe atrophy and PET scans typically demonstrate hypometabolism in the front and temporal areas."
nervous system,63, A 75-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a transient ischaemic attack. Her only past medical history is type II diabetes of 20-year duration. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and ECG showed atrial fibrillation. Which one of the following is most likely to prevent her from having a stroke?,ACE inhibitors,Aspirin,β blockers,Insulin,Warfarin,E,"If warfarin is contraindicated, aspirin should be used. Reducing blood pressure (BP) by any class of anti-hypertensive reduces the risk of stroke. HOPE study showed ACE-Is reduce the relative risk of stroke which may be independent of lowering BP. Tight glycaemic control also reduces the risk of cerebrovascular events, however, in the given scenario, the strongest stroke prevention strategy is warfarin."
nervous system,64,A 19-year-old man accuses his friend of making his right arm swing out at a stranger. What is the best term to describe his condition?,Control,Persecution,Guilt,Reference,Grandeur,A,"Delusion of control is a false belief that another person, group of people, or external force controls one's general thoughts, feelings, impulses, or behavior"
nervous system,65,"A 19-year-old man has been happier and more positive than usual, with more energy than he has ever felt before for no particular reason.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Atypical depression,Marked depression,Bipolar syndrome,Psychosis,Hypomania,E,"Features like i) elevated mood ii) more energy than before iii) getting more work done at the office (loss of inhibition) are common for both mania and hypomania. This is not mania as in mania we shall get psychotic symptoms like i) delusion of grandeur ii) auditory hallucinations, which are absent here"
nervous system,66,"A 25-year-old male is brought to the Emergency department by his family. He has become isolative, and is talking in a disorganised fashion. He complains that his thoughts are 'leaking' from his head and can be read by all. What is the likely diagnosis?",Borderline (emotionally unstable) personality disorder,Delirium,Persistent delusional disorder,Psychotic depression,Schizophrenia,E,"The age and sex of the patient fits the demographic profile of schizophrenia. The symptom of thought broadcasting is one of Schneider's first rank symptoms, which are widely regarded as specific to schizophrenia. Therefore schizophrenia is the correct answer. Schneider's first rank symptoms are:  delusional perception thought insertion, broadcasting or withdrawal third party hallucinations, and passivity.  These are considered specific to schizophrenia. Borderline personality disorder, may present with symptoms mimicking psychosis, for example, pseudo-hallucinations, but not thought broadcasting.

He is on long term antipsychotic meds. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Shy drager syndrome,Parkinsonism,Huntington’s chorea,Tardive dyskinesia,Akathisia,B,Antypsychotic drugs can cause parkinsonism
nervous system,70,Which of the following suggests a true epileptic seizure rather than a psychogenic non epileptic seizure?,A rise in serum prolactin following the seizure,Biting the tip of their tongue,Gradual onset,Incontinence,Closed eyes during the seizure,A,"Psychogenic non epileptic seizures, also known as pseudoseizures, have no neurological cause. It is thought to be a form of conversion disorder and most patients have an identifiable source of stress. The eyes are often closed, which is less common in a true seizure, and there is resistance if you try to open them. The onset may be gradual and they tend to last longer than a true seizure. Although incontinence and tongue biting are less common in pseudoseizure, they still occur with well read patients. Serum prolactin rises postictally and can be used to determine a true seizure if concerned."

On examination you notices he has a unilateral resting tremor and odd spasms in his facial muscles. Blood tests reveal deranged LFTs. Given the most likely diagnosis, which of the following is most useful in the treatment?",Tetrathiomolybdate,Steroids,Venesection,Penicillamine,Selenium,D,"Wilsons disease is the most likely diagnosis due to evidence of Tremor with cerebellar signs. It is an autosomal recessive condition thought to be caused by abnormal copper metabolism and deficiency of caeruloplasmin which leads to copper deposition in several organs.  The liver is usually affected by the abnormal copper metabolism as are the eyes leading to Kayser Fleischer rings. It typically presents with neuropsychiatric features such as asymmetrical tremor and chorea and cerebellar signs. There is evidence of liver disease and Kayser flescher rings in the eye. Numerous other organs can be affected. Low caeruloplasmin levels are found and are useful in the diagnosis. Classically penicillamine is utilised as a chelating agent. It forms soluble complexes with the copper which is then excreted in the urine. However the use of trientine especially with zinc which was previously utilised when penicillamine was intolerable, is thought to be very effective and some consider it as first line in neurological and hepatic disease. Zinc alone is also useful especially before symptoms appear as it slows the onset. Tetrathiomolybdate is being investigated but is not yet available in the UK."

Within the upper arm it lies lateral to the brachial artery, crossing to the medial side above and through the antecubital fossa. It then passes between the heads of the pronator teres muscle which it supplies, and other branches supply the flexor carpi radialis, palmaris longus, flexor pollicis longus, and flexor digitorum superficialis muscles. The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve supplies:  the pronator quadratus flexor pollicis longus, and the lateral half of flexor digitorum profundus.  Within the hand, a superficial cutaneous branch passes over the flexor retinaculum, with the main branch passing deep to the flexor retinaculum. Within the palm, the recurrent branch supplies the muscles of the thenar eminence (the flexor pollicis brevis, abductor pollicis brevis and opponens pollicis muscles, except the adductor supplied by the ulnar nerve). Within the palm, the median nerve supplies the two lateral lumbrical muscles, and provides cutaneous sensory and sympathetic fibres to the palmar surface of the thumb and to the lateral two and a half fingers and nail beds."

The feeling that other people have changed is derealisation - see below. Depersonalisation may occur in  Almost all major psychiatric disorders Drug abuse Migraine Epilepsy Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and, transiently, in  Normal individuals.  ECT has been tried in the past. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants and coping strategies are useful. Derealisation is a separate pathology. Depersonalisation is a change in an individual's self-awareness such that they feel detached from their own experience with the self, the body and mind seeming alien. Derealisation is a change in an individual's experience of the environment where the world around them feels unreal and unfamiliar."

nervous system,88,"A 19-year-old man with known history of OM (otitis media) presents with headache, lethargy, sweating and shivering. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Furuncle,Meningitis,Myringitis,Nasopharyngeal tumor,OM,B,OM often can be a cause of intracranial extension leading to cerebral abscess or meningitis
nervous system,89,A 67-year-old lady with Parkinson's Disease requires a combination of carbidopa and a dopamine agonist to control her motor symptoms. She then gradually develops distressing paranoid delusions regarding spousal infidelity in the setting of mild cognitive impairment. Which of the following antipsychotics would be most appropriate?,Chlorpromazine,Haloperidol,Olanzapine,Quetiapine,Risperidone,D,"Both first and second generation antipsychotics can cause extrapyramidal side effects in patients with PD. Quetiapine and Clozapine are significantly less likely to do so and are the treatment of choice where an antipsychotic is required. Clozapine is more likely to be effective, but because of the need for haematological monitoring it is reasonable to try Quetiapine first. In either case it is advisable to start with a very low dose and exercise caution. All the other options are incorrect as they are each associated with a significant risk of extrapyramidal side effects. "
nervous system,90,"A 29 year old male presents to his GP with left sided facial weakness.  He has been unwell for several weeks following return from a holiday with headache, pyrexia and joint pains.  He has a left facial palsy and a Lumbar Puncture is carried out which showed increased WCC ( greater than 90% polymorphs), increased protein content and glucose 50 percent that of serum. What is the likely diagnosis?",Sarcoidosis,Viral Meningitis,Guillain Barre syndrome,Borrelia burgdorferi meningitis,Bells palsy,D,The most likely diagnosis is Lyme disease.  The initial bite leads to erythema migrans and then neurologically it can lead to meningitis and cranial nerve palsies.  The systemic features and LP findings are not indicative of Bells Palsy.  Sarcoidosis can lead to cranial nerve palsies but does not normally present in this manner.  GBS leads to distal progressive weakness and this is the predominant features.  Viral meningitis does not lead to these features.
nervous system,91,What is indicative of a parietal lesion?,Visual inattention,Superior homonymous Quadrantanopia,Personality Change,Expressive Dysphasia,Hallucinations,A,"The most indicative is visual attention as parietal lobe damage leads to  inferior homonymous quadrantanopia, visual inattention, constructional and dressing apraxia and ideomotor apraxia. Gerstmanns syndrome is whereby the  part of the dominant parietal lobe (angular gyrus) is affected and comprises acalculia, agraphia, impaired right/left discrimination and finger agnosia.  Personality change suggests frontal lobe, hallucinations temporal lobe as does the upper quadrantanopia and expressive dysphasia is when the Brocas area is affected."
nervous system,92,"A 24-year-old college student presents with nausea, vomiting, headache, neck stiffness and a fever of 38.4C. What is the most appropriate empirical antibiotic to be started?",Ceftriaxone,Penicillin,Gentamicin,Tazobactam,Meropenem,A,"Empiric therapy should begin as soon as bacterial meningitis is thought likely. Widespread resistance to penicillins and sulfonamides has forced a consideration of new agents for the treatment of bacterial meningitis, such as cephalosporins, vancomycin (Vancocin), rifampin (Rifadin), carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. In patients with meningitis caused by penicillin- or cephalosporin-resistant strains vancomycin may be used in combination with a third-generation cephalosporin but should not be used alone. Rifampin should be used only in combination with other antimicrobial agents as resistance develops rapidly when it is used alone. Though meropenem can be an alternative to cefotaxime and ceftriaxone but due to its seizure activity it is not preferred as 1st line. Fluoroquinolones are also not used as 1st line"

She recently quit her job as she states they did not appreciate her and criticised her work. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Narcissistic Personality Disorder,Borderline Personality Disorder,Dependent Personality Disorder,Histrionic Personality Disorder,Nil,D,"This history is highly indicative of a histrionic personality disorder. They are emotional, dramatic and attention seekers. They are often sexually inappropriate. In borderline personality disorder patients often feel empty with frequent episodes of self harm or attempted suicide."

What is the most likely condition?",Acute metabolic alkalosis,Acute resp alkalosis,Compensated resp alkalosis,Compensated metabolic acidosis,Acute metabolic acidosis,C,"In panic attack there occurs hyperventilation which causes washout of CO2 and leads to acute respiratory alkalosis resulting in raised pH >7.45 (here 7.52), low PCO2 (here 2.2 kPa) with compensatory decrease in HCO3 (here 20meq/l)"
nervous system,95,"A 27-year-old female presents with persistent fatigue, myalgia, poor concentration and irritability following a flu like illness 18 months previously. A diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is made. What is the appropriate initial management of this patient?",Antidepressants,Cognitive behavioural therapy,ECT,Psychoanalysis,Reversion therapy,B,"In general, in order to receive a diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome, a patient must satisfy two criteria. First, they must have severe chronic fatigue of four months or longer duration(3 months in a child or young person) with other known medical conditions excluded by clinical diagnosis. Secondly, they must concurrently have four or more of the following symptoms:  Substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration Sore throat Tender lymph nodes Muscle pain Multi-joint pain without swelling or redness Headaches of a new type Pattern or severity Unrefreshing sleep, or Post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours.

nervous system,96,Which of the following features is characteristic of early Alzheimer's disease?,Ataxic gait,Impaired short term memory,Myoclonic jerks,Urinary incontinence,Visual hallucinations,B,Alzheimer's disease is characterised early in the disease by short term memory loss. The other features listed here would suggest an alternative diagnosis such as:  Normal pressure hydrocephalus (gait ataxia and urinary incontinence) Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (myoclonic jerks) Delirium or Lewy body dementia (visual hallucinations).  Clinical Knowledge Summaries: When should I suspect dementia?
nervous system,97,"A 73-year-old male presents with a 12 months history of falls. His relatives have also noticed rather strange behavior of late and more recently he has had episodes of enuresis. Examination: disorientation to time and place, broad-based, clumsy gait. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Dementia,Pituitary adenoma,CVD,Syringomyelia,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,E,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a clinical symptom complex caused by the build-up of cerebrospinal fluid. This condition is characterized by abnormal gait, urinary incontinence, and (potentially reversible) dementia. history of falls and broad based clumsy gait (balance and gait disturbance), strange behavior and disorientation to time and place (due to dementia), episodes of enuresis (urinary incontinence) points towards normal pressure hydrocephalus. Classic triad of normal pressure hydrocephalus: i) gait abnormality ii) urinary incontinence and iii) dementia"
nervous system,98,A 50 year old gentleman who is a heavy smoker presents with weakness. He has noticed it increasingly difficulty to get up from chairs and when going up stairs initially but this improves as he moves. He has been dizzy on standing and has had significant weight loss and a chronic cough. On examination he has symmetrical proximal weakness and diminished tendon reflexes which improves on repeated muscular contraction. He has normal cranial nerve examination. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Peripheral Neuropathy,Myasthenia Gravis,Polymyalgia Rheumatica,Lambert Eaton syndrome,Polymyositis,D,The most likely diagnosis is Lambert Eaton syndrome. It leads to the above symptoms with weakness improving with exercise and unlike myasthenia gravis eyes are not often affected which is often the presenting feature in Myasthenia. Autonomic features are common unlike in myasthenia Gravis. The neurological finding on clinical examination are not seen in polymyalgia Rheumatic or polymyositis and the pattern of proximal weakness is very unlikely due to peripheral neuropathy.
nervous system,99,A 32 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus is complaining of double vision.  It is worst on looking left and is improved when covering his left eye. What structure is likely to have been involved?,Left optic nerve,Left abducens,Right abducens,Left trochlear,Left oculomotor,B,As the horizontal gaze to the left is where the diplopia is worst and is improved on covering the left eye then the left abducens is affected as this controls the left lateral rectus and thus leftward gaze.  The trochlear  nerve would lead to nystagmus on looking down and out.  The optic nerve would not lead to diplopia.
nervous system,100,A 7 year old boy has multiple motor tics and makes clicking sounds at unpredictable intervals. What is the diagnosis?,Tourettes syndrome,ADHD,Hyperekplexia,Autism,Normal varient,A,"Tourettes is diagnosed by the presence of multiple motor and at least one vocal tic over a year with no more than three tic free months. The onset must be before the age of 18 and autism, drug use and non tourette causes of tics must be ruled out."
nervous system,101,"Which of the following is not commonly found in a manic episode of bipolar disorder?
",Hypersexuality,Elevated mood,Pressured speech,Visual Hallucinations,Low attention span,D,Visual hallucinations are rare in bipolar mania and would warrant investigation for an organic cause.
nervous system,102,What is the best treatment for severe agitation in an elderly patient overnight?,Diazepam,Temazepam,Doxylamine,Chlorpromazine,Haloperidol,E,"Intramuscular haloperidol provides rapid tranquillisation in severely agitated patients. Although it can cause serious extra pyramidal side effects, it does not interact with many other medications or cause other problems. Lorazepam is another option and olanzapine is being used more often."
nervous system,103,A 48 year old female is complaining of repeatedly burning her right hand as she is unaware of the temperature.  She also has occipital headaches which are worsened by sneezing and coughing.  Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Cervical Disc Prolapse,Brachial Plexus Injury,Syringomyelia,Peripheral Neuropathy,Space Occupying lesion,C,"The most likely diagnosis is syringomyelia where a syrinx (fluid filled cavity) forms within the spinal cord.  This can occur in any area although is usually cervical or thoracic.  It is related to Arnold Chiari Malformation which explains the occipital headaches exacerbated by sneezing or coughing.    It leads to dissociative sensory symptoms (pain and temperature loss, gross touch proprioception and vibration preserved due to spinothalamic involvement)  in a cape distribution.  It can affect the motor cells and lead to small hand muscle wasting which then progresses proximally. It can be formed in association with Chiari malformation, secondary to trauma or tumour.  The rest of the diagnosis would not give a dissociative sensory loss."
nervous system,104,Which of the following provide sensory innervation to the palmar aspect of the ring finger?,Posterior musculocutaneous nerve,Radial nerve,Recurrent branch of the median nerve,Superficial branch of the radial nerve,Ulnar nerve,E,"The medial half of the ring finger is supplied by the ulnar nerve, and the lateral half is supplied by the median nerve. It comes from medial cord of brachial plexus, and it passes through Gayon canal in the wrist."
nervous system,105,Which of the following could be used to distinguish dementia from severe depression,Visual disturbance,Weight gain,Testosterone level testing,Weight loss,Grasp reflex,E,"The grasp reflex is a primitive reflex that babies have and lose at about 6 months. If something is put in their hand they will grab onto it. With neurone loss, particularly in the frontal lobe, this reflex reappears."
nervous system,106,A 37 year old joiner is referred to the clinic as he has a 6 month history of lower back pain.  It had come on suddenly 6 months ago.  He now has shooting pain down the back of both legs worse on left than right.  He also has numbness in his left foot.  On examination the pain is reproduced at 20 degrees straight leg lift on left.  He has reduced sensation over the sole of his foot of his foot and his ankle reflex is diminished and plantars are down going.  Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Mechanical Back pain,Discitis,Cauda equina syndrome,L5/S1 disc prolapse,L4/L5 disc prolapse,D,The straight leg raising is positive and thus this is indicative of a disc prolapse.  Due to the pattern of sensory loss and lack of ankle reflex this suggests S1 is affected.  L4/L5 would lead to sensation loss on anterior and plantar aspect of foot and lack of knee reflex.  Discitis is unlikely as he is systemically well.  Due to neurological findings this is more than mechanical back pain.  there is no evidence of faecal or urinary incontinence thus this is not a cauda equina syndrome.
nervous system,107,"A 45-year-old gentleman has noticed reduced libido for the past two months, since losing his job. He is having trouble sleeping, often waking early, and has lost weight due to a reduced appetite. His wife reports that he has been more argumentative than normal, especially in the morning when she is leaving for work. What psychiatric diagnosis does he have?",Adjustment disorder,Bipolar disorder,Depression,Depressive anxiety neurosis,Generalised anxiety disorder,A,"Adjustment disorder occurs within three months of an identifiable stressor and lasts six months from the withdrawal of the stressor. The patient will show either distress in excess of that expected or a disruption of their day to day life. The criteria for diagnosing generalised anxiety disorder are anxiety/tension, occasionally accompanied by physical symptoms, on more days than not for more than six months. It is more a diagnosis of exclusion however, as it may be due to prescription medication or another psychiatric illness. It is part of the anxiety neuroses. Anxiety neurosis is a major condition, affecting one in seven Britons. It includes:  Generalised anxiety disorder Obsessive compulsive disorder Panic disorder, and Post-traumatic stress.  The neurosis can be defined according to the chief symptom - depression, obsession, anxiety. Patients show maladaptive psychological symptoms not due to organic cause and out of proportion to the precipitating stress. Underlying psychiatric illness should always be sought, especially depression. Anxiety disorders can be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Benzodiazepines and beta blockers can be used on a PRN basis for patients who suffer with panic attacks. Cognitive behavioural therapy can also be of help. To make a diagnosis of depression symptoms must be present almost everyday for at least two weeks. Symptoms of depression are those of:  Anhedonia (lack of enjoyment in daily life) Sleeplessness (usually early waking) Loss of concentration Loss of appetite and weight loss Loss of libido Mood swings (particularly worse in the morning and often associated with feelings of guilt or worthlessness) Psychomotor retardation or agitation, and Suicidal ideation.  Suicidal thoughts must always be checked for when diagnosing depression, to maintain patient's safety. Bipolar disorder is depression with episodes of mania. In this case depression should definitely be on your list of differentials, but the fact this has happened since losing his job should make you strongly consider adjustment disorder as the diagnosis. Adjustment disorders can have predominantly depressive symptoms, anxiety or behavioural disturbance. The key is that there is an identifiable psycho-social stressor within one month of the onset of symptoms, as seen here. These symptoms can persist for up to two years and still be called an adjustment disorder.   The key here is the symptoms being brought on since the loss of his job."
nervous system,108,You are asked to see an 81 year old woman by her daughter. The daughter explains that her mother was started on haliperidol 3 days earlier and has become feverish and extremely confused. The daughter describes a progressive change in the mothers personality over the past 3 years. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Stroke,Delerium,Alzheimers,TIA,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,E,"The patient is suffering from neuroleptic malignant syndrome which has been caused by giving haliperidol to a patient with Lewy Body dementia. Its symptoms include pyrexia, altered consciousness, sweating, rigidity and autonomic imbalance."
nervous system,109,A 30-year-old man is becoming concerned about the safety of his family. He has been checking the locks of the door every hour during the night. He becomes very anxious if his wife tries to stop him. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Paranoid delusion,PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder),Social phobia,OCD (obsessive compulsive disoeder),GAD (generalized anxiety disorder),D,"Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental health condition where a person has obsessive thoughts and compulsive activity. An obsession is an unwanted and unpleasant thought, image or urge that repeatedly enters a person's mind, causing feelings of anxiety, disgust or unease. A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour or mental act that someone feels they need to carry out to try to temporarily relieve the unpleasant feelings brought on by the obsessive thought"
nervous system,110,A 34-year-old female presents with swallowing difficulties. She says that she feels a andquot;lump in her throatandquot; that is worse in the morning. There is no associated pain and she had a steak sandwich for supper. Her family feels that she has lost weight since her partner left her eight months ago. On meeting her you note sweaty palms and tremor. She has a BMI 22 kg/m^2. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Anorexia nervosa,Barrett's oesophagus,Globus hystericus,Hyperthyroidism,Pheochromocytoma,C,"Despite this woman's weight loss there is unlikely to be an organic cause, as she is able to swallow food boluses. There is no evidence of acid reflux to produce Barrett's oesophagus. Hyperthyroidism may present with weight loss and a sensation of fullness in the throat, plus tachycardia and tremor. However the weight loss appears to be associated with a life change (stressor) and the andquot;lump in her throatandquot; alters throughout the day. Anorexia nervosa is diagnosed when BMI is less than 17, there is altered body image and avoidance of food. Phaeochromocytoma may give weight loss, sweating and tremor, however it would not give a strange sensation in the neck, and there would be complaints of palpitations or anxiety with tachycardia. Globus hystericus is part of the anxiety disorders and thought to be due to somatisation. In this case a stressor is the loss of her partner and this has led to anxiety symptoms and altered sensation in her neck. This sensation is fluctuating and there is no mechanical problem. It is a diagnosis of exclusion and therefore it would be necessary to rule out some of the other mentioned diagnoses first."
nervous system,111,"A 23-year-old male presents to his GP 2 weeks after a RTA (road traffic accident) concerned about increasing anxiety lethargy and headache. At the time he had a CT brain after banging his head on the steering wheel, which revealed no abnormality. 6 months following this episode his symptoms have resolved. What did his original symptoms likely represent?",Conversion disorder,PTSD,Somatization disorder,GAD,Post-concussion syndrome,E,"Post concussion syndrome is a set of symptoms that may continue for weeks, months, or a year or more after a concussion – a minor form of traumatic brain injury"
nervous system,112,Which of the following is a contraindication to ECT?,Raised intracranial pressure,Cardiac pacemaker,Pregnancy,Immunocompromised,Epilepsy,A,"The only absolute contraindication is raised intracranial pressure .

There of loss triceps reflex on the left. At what level is her cervical disc prolapse likely to be?","C8, T.1","C7,8","C6,7","C4,5","C5,6",C,"The likely level is C6,7 due to the clinical findings of weakness of radial nerve muscles, reduced triceps reflex and sensory loss in C6, C7 dermatomes."
nervous system,115,A 60-year-old woman has suffered three episodes of transient right monocular blindness. Her rate is 88 beats per minute (regular) and she is in sinus rhythm. Which is the single most appropriate investigation that would diagnose the condition?,Carotid duplex ultrasonography,CT scan,Echocardiography,Fasting lipid profile,MRI brain scan,A,"Whilst you may not arrange carotid duplex directly from primary care, the Royal College are clear in their curriculum statements that you would need to have an understanding of investigations that may be arranged by secondary care and to be able to discuss this in more general terms with your patient, including indications. This patient experienced amaurosis fugax caused by internal carotid artery atherosclerotic stenosis. Other features include temporary paresis, aphasia, or sensory deficits. Fundoscopic examination may reveal bright yellow cholesterol emboli in patients with retinal involvement. The investigation to identify the significant stenosis or occlusive lesion usually greater than 70% is carotid duplex ultrasonography. "
nervous system,116,Which of the following symptoms is more suggestive of a functional disorder?,Disorientation in time,Inability to retain new information,Mutism,Perseveration,Visual hallucinations,C,Functional refers to an illness that is without a structural defect. Organic brain syndromes are physical conditions including structural brain disease and metabolic disturbances causing mental dysfunction. Visual hallucinations present with patients seeing things that should not be there or morphing/distorting of objects.  Perseveration refers to the inability for someone to leave a chain of though and to ruminate on it.  Mutism is the most likely of the symptoms described to be associated with a functional disorder but is associated with schizophrenia or autism.
nervous system,117,"A 23-year-old man is brought to the Emergency department with a gunshot injury to his right upper thigh. On examination, the wound lies about 4 cm below the inguinal ligament. The vascular status of the limb is normal. Local neurological examination reveals numbness over the anterior thigh and medial aspect of his leg. Although he is able to flex the hip, he is unable to extend the knee on the affected side. The knee jerk is diminished but the ankle jerk is preserved. Which of the following nerves is most likely to be affected in this patient?",Common peroneal nerve,Femoral nerve,Lateral cutaneous nerve of thigh,Pudendal nerve,Saphenous nerve,B,"The femoral nerve arises from the lumbar plexus (L2-4). It exits the pelvis by passing beneath the medial inguinal ligament to enter the femoral triangle, after penetrating the psoas muscle. In the femoral triangle, it lies just lateral to the femoral artery and vein. It may be injured by the following:  Gunshot wounds Direct penetrating wounds Traction during surgery Catheterisation of the femoral artery Massive haematoma within the thigh Nerve injury secondary to femoral nerve block Psoas abscess Fractured pelvis Dislocation of the hip  Apart from trauma, it may be affected in patients with diabetes mellitus (diabetic neuropathy) and lumbar spondylosis. The femoral nerve innervates the iliopsoas, which helps in flexion of the hip, and the quadriceps, which help in extension of the knee. The motor branch to the iliopsoas originates in the pelvis proximal to the inguinal ligament and injury at or above this level leads to loss of hip flexion. The sensory branch of the femoral nerve, the saphenous nerve, innervates the skin over the medial aspect of the thigh and the anterior and medial aspects of the calf. Hence femoral nerve injury results in numbness over the medial aspect of the thigh and the antero-medial aspect of the leg. Motor loss includes weakness of the quadriceps muscle and decreased patellar reflex (knee jerk) (the ankle jerk is preserved since it is innervated by the tibial nerve [S1-S2]). In longstanding, sub-acute injuries, the patient finds that the knee gives way on walking and has difficulty climbing stairs."
nervous system,118,A schizophrenic patient hears people only when he is about to fall asleep. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hypnopompic hallucinations,Hyponogogic hallucinations,Hippocampal hallucinations,Delirious hallucinations,Auditory hallucinations,B,"Hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations are visual, tactile, auditory, or other sensory events, usually brief but occasionally prolonged, that occur at the transition from wakefulness to sleep (hypnagogic) or from sleep to wakefulness (hypnopompic)"
nervous system,119,"A 33-year-old motorcyclist is brought to the emergency department following a high speed road traffic accident. On examination his pulse rate is 110/min, blood pressure is 100/74 mmHg and his GCS is 15. There is swelling and tenderness over his left lower leg, x ray of which reveals a closed but comminuted fracture of his left tibia. Whilst he is being transferred to the orthopaedic ward he complains of severe unremitting pain in his left lower leg and numbness in his left foot. The dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulsations are palpable. The pain in his foot is made worse by passive dorsiflexion of the ankle. Which of the following is the most likely cause for this patient's signs and symptoms?",Common peroneal nerve palsy,Compartment syndrome,Deep venous thrombosis,Ruptured Achilles tendon,Torn calf muscles (gastrocnemius and soleus),B,"Compartment syndrome is defined as an increase in the interstitial fluid pressure within an osseofascial compartment of sufficient magnitude to cause a compromise of the microcirculation leading to necrosis of the affected nerve(s) and muscle(s). It is a devastating early complication seen after fractures and crush injury, commonly in the lower limb. It can also be caused by deep thermal burns, electrical injuries, restricting tourniquets, venom from snake bites and fluid extravasation (for example, intravenous regional anaesthesia). Early in its development the peripheral pulses are normal as are colour of the affected part (demonstrated by examining the digits of the affected limb), temperature and capillary refill since it is the microvasculature which is initially affected. Loss of peripheral pulses is usually a late and often sinister sign. The patient may complain of unremitting pain that is not relieved even by high doses of opioid analgesics. Severe pain in response to passive stretch of the ischaemic muscles is by far the most dramatic and reliable clinical sign of compartment syndrome. Sensory loss (distal paraesthesia) occurs before motor loss since the thin cutaneous nerve fibres are more susceptible to ischaemia than the motor fibres. With progression of the condition the limb becomes tense and swollen, and if left untreated, the muscle weakness progresses to paralysis and irreversible myoneural necrosis within six to eight hours, even with compartment pressures in the range of 30-35 mmHg (taken in conjunction with the patient's diastolic blood pressure; see below). The areas of muscle may also infarct giving rise to:  rhabdomyolysis hyperkalaemia hyperphosphataemia high uric acid levels, and metabolic acidosis.  Classically, the compartment pressures are measured using a slit catheter device. The normal resting pressure within the compartment tissues is estimated to be about 3-4 mmHg. Compartment pressures in excess of 30-35 mmHg in a normally perfused patient suggested the need for open compartment fasciotomy. Recent evidence, however, suggests that fasciotomy should be undertaken if the difference between the diastolic pressure and the measured compartment pressure is less than 30 mmHg. Hence if the patient is in hypovolaemic shock, as frequently happens in trauma victims, even a modestly increased compartment pressure warrants fasciotomy. Compartment syndrome can also affect the upper limb, commonly the forearm. In compartment syndromes affecting the anterior forearm the greatest neurologic damage is to the median nerve as it is located in the centre of the muscle mass to be infarcted, whereas the ulnar nerve lies along the periphery of the compartment and is thus subject to less ischaemia and damage."

A 15 cm version exists for obese patients and a 5 cm 19G needle (with 0.5 cm markings) is available for paediatric use. The catheter is made of biologically inert Teflon or nylon and is transparent. The distal end has a rounded tip which is closed (not open) to reduce the risk of dural or vascular puncture. Two or more side ports are also found in the distal end. Catheters are usually 90 cm in length. There are markings at 5 cm intervals at the distal end and from 5-15 cm there are additional 1 cm markings. The filter has 0.22 micron mesh (not 0.55) that acts as a bacterial, viral and foreign body filter."
nervous system,127,What is the most likely structure damage if there is foot drop with weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and eversion?,Femoral Nerve,Common peroneal nerve,L5 S1 nerve root,Sciatic nerve,Tibial nerve,B,Damage to the common peroneal leads to foot drop and weakness of dorsiflexion and eversion.  Sciatic nerve leads to more sensory symptoms such as Sciatic .  L5 S1 would lead to loss of big toe movement and dermatomal sensory changes and loss of ankle reflex.
nervous system,128,"A 65 year old male is brought to A and E.  He had collapsed.  Prior to this he felt light headed.  He has since noticed that he has double vision when looking to the left side and on examination his right eye has a dilated pupil, is looking down and in, and he has ptosis.  He also has a left sided hemiparesis. Which artery has been affected?",Basilar artery branch,Anterior cerebral artery,Posterior cerebral artery,Middle cerebral artery,Anterior communicating artery,A,"The findings of a third cranial nerve palsy and contralateral hemiparesis (also known as Weber Syndrome) suggests there is infarction at the brainstem near the third nucleus and this is supplied by the basilar artery. This region is supplied by branches of the basilar artery. Parinauds syndrome is where the dorsal midbrain is involved and leads to a vertical gaze palsy.  Posterior cerebral artery occlusion leads to visual field loss, sensory loss and impaired conscious level.  If anterior cerebral involved this leads to contralateral weakness, sensory loss, dysphasia, apraxia and frontal signs an d symptoms whilst middle cerebral artery leads to weakness of contralateral face and arm (unlike anterior where often legs involved) and there is also sensory loss, dysphasia and neglect."

nervous system,132,"A 28-year old man complained of voices which told him to self-harm. He is unemployed, having dropped out of university two years previously. Dependence on which of the following is the most likely cause?",Alcohol,Amphetamines,Benzodiazepines,Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB),Opiates,B,"The question suggests that the patient is suffering from actions experienced as made or influenced by external agents, a Schneider's first rank symptom. Amphetamines are known to lead to drug induced psychosis, which can mimic schizophrenia Benzodiazepines are not known to induce schizophrenia, but there are reports of auditory hallucinations on benzodiazepine withdrawal. GHB is not associated with drug induced schizophrenia; opiates may be associated with hallucinations, but not Schneider's first rank symptoms. One must be aware of the potential dual-diagnosis scenario; that is the patient who is dependent on a drug, but who also has schizophrenia, which may have been precipitated by drug-use or stress, but which is not drug-induced per se."

Causes of secondary brain injury may include:  Hypoperfusion Hypoxia, and Reperfusion injury.  The factors which determine the cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) include the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (not systolic blood pressure) and the intracranial pressure (ICP), as shown in the following equation: Cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) = mean arterial pressure (MAP) − intracranial pressure (ICP) The cerebral perfusion pressure is usually maintained above 70 mmHg. In severe traumatic brain injury, the autoregulation of cerebral blood flow is lost. Cerebral oxygen consumption should be minimised following head injury (not maximised)."
nervous system,136,Which of the following is considered indicative of an abnormal grief reaction?,Adopting mannerisms of the deceased,Anger,Denial,Duration longer than 12 months,Hallucinations,D,"Worden (1991) gives four headings for 'complicated grief reactions'  Chronic grief reactions Delayed reactions Exaggerated grief reactions and Masked grief reactions.  There are huge variations between individuals and cultures and the question of what is normal and abnormal grief needs to be approached with sensitivity. In the west, six months is considered average for grief, most authorities would consider greater than 12 months abnormal.  Anger and denial have been identified by Kubler-Ross (1969) as part of her five 'stages' of normal grief (although even Kubler-Ross herself now states that the concept of a neat linear progression through grief is simplistic). Hallucinations and adopting the deceased's mannerisms can occur in the early stages of grief and would not be considered abnormal on their own."
nervous system,137,A patient is brought to A and E with status epilepticus.  He is known to be epileptic on Keppra.  He has been given PR diazepam with no avail and continues to seize.

He also could not remember his best friend passing away in the previous week. He knew who he was and who his wife was and remember things from the distant past. This has now completely resolved and he does not recall the event. There was nil of note on examination and bloods were normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Fugue state,Functional Disorder,Transient global amnesia,TIA,Stroke,C,The above history is indicative of Transient Global amnesia. The other diagnoses are unlikely to lead to this symptoms in isolation. In transient global amnesia there is global loss of recent memory with the patient unable to retain new things and unable to recall recent memories. . The patient often repeats themselves and can become agitated. In fugue state there is complete loss of memory including their identity and patients are unable to recall a long period of their life and the patient is usually found wandering.

She was complaining of a headache, malaise, fever and nausea and vomiting one day previously and then suddenly dropped her conscious level. She is dysphasic and has a right hemiparesis. She then develops a focal seizure. A CT shows abnormalities in temporal lobes. A lumbar puncture is performed and reveals a slightly high protein, normal glucose and mononuclear cells. Given the most likely diagnosis, which treatment is it most likely to respond to?",IV ceftriaxone,IV amoxicillin,IV aciclovir,IV dexamethasone,Oral aciclovir,C,"The history is highly indicative of encephalitis, most likely herpes simplex encephalitis. The CT findings with temporal lobe abnormalities is characteristic of herpes simplex encephalitis. Lumbar puncture findings are suggestive and a CSF sample for PCR to identify herpes simplex can be used to confirm the diagnosis. IV aciclovir should be commenced immediately. Often however the patient is started on IV antibiotics also in case there is an underlying bacterial cause."
nervous system,155,A 43 year old female present to a GP with a tremor in her hand.  It is not present at rest but is accentuated when she is carrying out an action.  Her father had a similar problem.  She is otherwise well and there is nil of note in examination. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Huntingtons Chorea,Vascular Dementia,Anxiety,Parkinsons Disease,Benign essential tremor,E,The most likely diagnosis is benign essential tremor as there is no other abnormal findings and the tremor is not present at rest so less likely to be Parkinsons Disease.
nervous system,156,"A 65 year old gentleman presents to his GP with bilateral leg pain. This develops after he has walked for about ten minutes, where he feels pain and burning. He also feels that his legs are weak. The pain is only relieved once he sits down for a few minutes. He finds the pain is worse when walking uphill. On examination he has palpable peripheral pulses. He has a past medical history of osteoarthritis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disc Prolapse,Peripheral vascular disease,Meralgia Paraesthetica,Spinal stenosis,Polymyositis,D,"This history is highly indicative of spinal stenosis. Spinal stenosis is due to narrowing of the spinal canal which produces root ischaemia and neurogenic claudication. A hint to the diagnosis is the relief when sitting and symptoms are less on walking uphill. This is indicative of spinal stenosis and this along with the normal vascular examination makes peripheral vascular disease less likely. Risk factors for the development include osteoarthritis, congenital narrowing, ankylosing spondylitis, hyperparathyroidism, cushings and acromegaly."

nervous system,158,"A 72 year old female with hypertension and ischaemic heart disease presents with dysarthria and clumsiness of her left hand. On examination she has right sided facial weakness, clearly dysarthric and mild left hand weakness and clumsiness. What area of the brain is most likely affected?",Thalamus,Posterior limb internal capsule,Anterior limb internal capsule,Ventral pons,Dorsal pons,E,"This history is indicative of dysarthria/clumsy hand syndrome. This leads to dysarthria secondary to ipsilateral face and tongue weakness and mild contralateral weakness and clumsiness. This is secondary to a lacunar infarct affecting the dorsal pons. Lacunar infarcts are small infarcts 0.5 to 1 cm caused by occlusion of deep penetrating arteries. The areas involved in the majority are periventricular white matter, basal ganglia, cerebellum and brainstem. There is usually a background of long standing hypertension. Cortical function is preserved. As well as the dysarthria clumsy hand syndrome other presentation include pure motor hemiplegia, pure sensory stroke, ataxic hemiparesis and severe dysarthria with facial weakness."
nervous system,159,"A 70-year-old woman comes to the Emergency Department having taken an overdose of her bisoprolol which has been prescribed for hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Her husband passed away from cancer some 10 days ago, and she admits to being very lonely and depressed. She has a past history of ischaemic heart disease but is able to self-care and is independent. She owns her own home and receives a workplace pension from her husband's contributions. There is a history of depression some 20 years earlier, but she has not taken medication for this in the past. Physical examination reveals bradycardia of 35 consistent with her overdose and a BP of 90/60, it is otherwise unremarkable. Which of the points in her history is associated with the greatest risk of suicide?",Age 70,Chronic physical illness,Female sex,Previous history of depression,Recent bereavement,E,"The answer is her recent bereavement. The death of this patient's spouse has the greatest impact on her risk of suicide. During the first week after a bereavement, the standardised mortality ratio for women is 120 times the background rate, versus 90 times for men. Given the proximity to the event, (only 10 days earlier), close monitoring of this woman is indicated to prevent another suicide attempt. Successful suicide is more common in males than females, although depression, chronic illness, and increasing age all impact negatively on risk. In this case, there are no signs of heart failure, implying her physical illness is relatively well managed, and the depression occurred some years earlier. Family history has a strong impact on suicide risk, with a three-fold increased risk of suicide amongst women with a sibling who has successfully taken their own life, and a two-fold increase for men."
nervous system,160,"A 28 year old gentleman had an URTI.  Approximately 2 weeks later he presented to A and E with a distal weakness.  On examination he is pyrexial and slightly tachycardic with a normal blood pressure but is tachypneoic.  Neurological examination reveals 4/5 power in all limbs distally and weakness is his facial muscles.  There is no sensation loss.  Reflexes are absent. Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment would be most useful?",IV methylprednisolone,Nerve conduction studies,Gabapentin,Nil specific,IV Immunoglobulin,E,The history and clinical findings are indicative of GBS.  Intravenous immunoglobulin and plasma exchange are shown to be effective in Guillain barre syndrome. They are most useful when started within 7 days. IV methylprednisolone on its own is not shown to be beneficial however is useful in combination with IVIg.
nervous system,161,"A 45-year-old man keeps having intrusive thoughts about having dirt under the bed. He can’t keep himself from thinking about these thoughts. If he tries to resist, he starts having palpitations. What is the most likely diagnosis?",OC personality,OCD,Schizophrenia,Panic disorder,Phobia,B,"Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a disorder in which a person has uncontrollable, reoccurring thoughts (obsessions) and behaviors (compulsions) that he or she feels the urge to repeat over and over. Here patient’s thoughts are obsession and though no compulsive act is described (like repeated cleansing of dirt) but his nature of thought like inability to resist the thinking or getting palpitation on trying to avoid thinking can be regarded as compulsion of thought. CBT is 1st line treatment and antidepressants (SSRIs) are tried if no response to CBT. More severe OCD may require a longer course of therapy and/or medication"
nervous system,162,You are asked to consent a patient for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Which of the following is not a hazard of ECT?,Amnesia,Musculoskeletal injury,Induction of cardiac arrhythmia,Induction of dementia,Memory loss,D,"Side effects of ECT are rare. Over the course of ECT, it may be more difficult for patients to remember newly learned information, though this difficulty disappears over the days and weeks following completion of the ECT course. Some patients also report a partial loss of memory for events that occurred during the days, weeks, and months preceding ECT. While most of these memories typically return over a period of days to months following ECT, some patients report longer lasting problems with recall of these memories. Other individuals report improved memory ability following ECT, because of its ability to remove the amnesia sometimes associated with severe depression. Cardiac arrhythmia may be stimulated by the electrical shock of ECT. Musculoskeletal injury has been reported after ECT, but with adequate anaesthetisation, this is rare. Dementia is an organic illness which is not induced by ECT."
nervous system,163,"A 65-year-old male presents with acute severe headache, ataxia, and vomiting. Six hours later he became drowsy. On examination he had left horizontal nystagmus, a partial left sixth cranial nerve palsy, and extensor plantar responses. His blood pressure was 188/110 mmHg. Which is the most likely cause for this deterioration?",Brain stem herniation,Cerebral oedema,Dehydration,Malignant hypertension,Non-convulsive status epilepticus,A,"The most likely explanation of the sudden deterioration will be brain stem herniation. The sudden onset of headache, ataxia, and vomiting a few hours prior to this suggest that there may have been an intracranial haemorrhage which led to mass effect and subsequent herniation. Brain herniation often causes false localising signs due to compression of various areas of the brain. There are various forms of herniation, which are outside the scope of this question. Simply, it usually follows two patterns: uncal herniation or central herniation. Clinical presentation of uncal herniation includes a third nerve paresis (ipsilateral dilated pupil, abnormal external ocular movements, including nystagmus), contralateral hemiparesis, which can lead to ipsilateral hemiparesis. The third nerve paresis occurs due to compression of the parasympathetic fibres around the third nerve, which results in unopposed sympathetic response. Contralateral hemiparesis occurs with compression of the cerebral peduncle. Ipsilateral hemiparesis and third nerve palsy occur late when the lateral translation is so great that it compresses the contralateral third nerve and peduncle. Central herniation usually presents with confusion and drowsiness, followed by impaired vertical gaze, small pupils, impaired oculocephalic reflexes, and bilateral corticospinal tract signs including increased tone and Babinski signs. Additional signs are present due to raised intracranial pressure: bradycardia, hypertension, irregular breathing (Cushing response), and a sixth-nerve palsy. The sixth nerve is usually the first to be compressed due to its long extracerebral intracranial course. Diplopia from either a third or sixth nerve palsy can cause nystagmus. This patient needs immediate intensive care support, with intubation and hyperventilation. The case should be discussed urgently with neurosurgeons, and their advice sought regarding the possibility of operative intervention. Intravenous mannitol and other hyperosmolar solutions are oftenindicated, and should be considered. Cerebral oedema could account for the sixth nerve palsy, nystagmus, and hypertension, but the deterioration with impaired consciousness and extensor plantar responses should lead you to consider herniation as the cause. Dehydration would not cause this constellation of neurological signs. The blood pressure in malignant hypertension is typically higher than this (greater than220/120 mmHg). This history is not typical for status epilepticus. "
nervous system,164,"A 67-year-old female presents with balance problems. Examination: nystagmus on left lateral gaze, a loss of the left corneal reflex and reduced hearing in the left ear. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Meniere’s disease,Acoustic neuroma,Cerebral abscess,Pituitary tumor,Gentamicin,B,"nystagmus, loss of corneal reflex, hearing loss, balance problem are well known feature of acoustic neuroma"
nervous system,165,"A 24-year-old female teacher collapsed in the classroom after complaining of a severe headache associated with nausea. She had been well in the preceding few days. She had no past medical history and did not take any regular or illicit drugs. She did not smoke or drink. On arrival in the Emergency department, her Glasgow coma scale was 12/15 (motor 6 vocal 3 eyes 3) and there was nuchal rigidity. Her blood pressure was 145/85 mmHg, pulse was 90 beats per minute and regular and temperature was 37.1°C. Heart sounds were normal and chest appeared clear. Cranial nerve examination revealed no abnormalities. Fundoscopy was normal. There were no obvious focal neurological signs on examining the peripheral nervous system, although both plantar responses were extensor. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 11.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 267 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 142 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 5.1 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 94 mol/L (60-110)   Serum CRP 5 U/L (less than5)   Fasting plasma glucose 5.4 mmol/L (3.5-6.0)   Serum cholesterol 3.8 mmol/L (less than5.2)    A CT scan of her brain was normal. A lumbar puncture was performed and yielded the following data:    Appearance Xanthochromia -   Opening pressure 15 cmH2O (6-18)   CSF White cell count 6 cells per mL (less than5)   CSF red cell count 1450 cells per mL (less than5)   CSF protein 0.46 g/L (0.15-0.45)    What should be the next step in the management of this patient?",Arrange a CT cerebral angiogram (CTA),Arrange an MR angiogram (MRA),Arrange urgent MRI brain scan,Call an anaesthetist to intubate the patient,Commence on intravenous cefotaxime and aciclovir,A,"The presentation of sudden onset of severe headache associated with nausea and/or vomiting is typical of a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the head should be performed in all suspected patients and has a sensitivity of 90-95%. There are no advantages to performing an MR scan brain if the CT scan is negative. A lumbar puncture is performed in negative CT scan patients with specific identification of xanthochromia. If xanthochromia is detected, as in this patient, a CT cerebral angiogram (CTA) should be arranged urgently. A CT angiogram is easier to arrange, requires less expertise to perform (important out of hours) and is safer than catheter-based digital subtraction angiography (DSA) cerebral angiography. It is also more practical for unstable patients. Catheter-based DSA remains the gold standard but helical CTA is approaching this level of accuracy. Magnetic resonance (MR) angiography is less sensitive. There is no evidence of infection in this patient and, therefore commencement of antibiotics is not required. With a GCS of 12, the patient should be able to maintain their own airway. Intubation may be necessary once the GCS falls below 8."
nervous system,166,Which of the following is a feature of delirium and schizophrenia?,Hallucinations,Inappropriate emotional state,Altered sleep wake cycle,Involuntary movements,Ptosis,A,Visual hallucinations are common in delirium and auditory hallucinations are common in schizophrenia.

These devices produce two rows of staples but do not divide the bowel. The bowel is divided with a scalpel immediately after the device has been fired and before it is released. The staples are not haemostatic and therefore the cut bowel wall should be inspected for signs of bleeding. These devices are used commonly to divide the rectum deep in the pelvis, therefore a rotating head (roticulator) is an advantage."

His doctors and nurses agree his rehabilitation is in his best interests, although likely to take weeks. What is the best medico-legal framework for his management?",Common law,DOLS (deprivation of liberty safeguarding),Mental Capacity Act,Mental Health Act,Nothing. He should be allowed to leave,B,"Deprivation of Liberty Safeguarding (DOLS) legislation, which has been added to the MCA 2007, is designed to fill the 'Bournewood gap' whereby the consent of a mentally incapacitated adult to remain in a given safe or therapeutic environment is in doubt. DOLS assessments require a doctor approved under the Mental Health Act (MHA) and a best interest assessor to ascertain whether the patient:  is over the age of 18 has a mental illness as defined under the Mental Health Act lacks capacity is being detained in his or her best interests  They must also ascertain that the DOLS order will not conflict with a pre-existing arrangement under either the MHA or Mental Capacity Act (MCA). The Mental Capacity Act has now superseded common law; both allow treatment of a mentally incapacitated adult in emergency circumstances, where such treatment is in their best interests. However the emergency powers of the MCA are designed only for short term crises, one of the reasons DOLS was introduced. The Mental Health Act is designed primarily to enforce psychiatric treatment and is neither necessary nor sufficient for his physical medical treatment. However the DOLS legislation, which has been added to the MCA, is designed for exactly such a situation, that is, a mentally incapacitated adult whose consent to remain is dubious. Doing nothing is not an option; you have a duty of care to vulnerable patients, and a court of law would take a dim view of any doctor who allowed such a patient to put himself at risk."

nervous system,188,A 65-year-old male is two days post-operation following an elective repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Surgery was uncomplicated and the aortic cross clamp time was below average. He has a low dose epidural infusion for analgesia. The patient complains that he feels paralysed below his waist. What best explains the cause of paralysis?,An epidural haematoma commonly occurs with normal coagulation,He has anterior spinal artery syndrome,His symptoms can be explained by the presence of local anaesthetic in the epidural space,Ischaemic damage to the spinal cord occurred during aortic cross clamping,The epidural needle probably caused direct spinal cord damage,D,"The main differential diagnosis in this scenario is whether his symptoms are related to the epidural or a consequence of aortic cross clamping. Low dose epidural infusions are weak concentrations of local anaesthetic agents delivered by a syringe pump. They are popular because they block sensory fibres but spare motor function, thus could not be totally responsible for his symptoms. Direct spinal cord injury from the epidural Tuohy needle is rare. The risk can theoretically be further reduced if the epidural technique is performed on patients who are awake using local anaesthesia. Epidural haematoma formation with spinal cord compression is extremely rare with normal coagulation. The presence of such a haematoma is unlikely to be masked by low dose local anaesthetic infusions in the epidural space. Permanent neurological damage may occur if surgical decompression is delayed. Epidurals can also be safely inserted into patients scheduled for anticoagulation, but are contraindicated in patients who are already anticoagulated. The spinal cord is supplied by an anterior spinal artery, two posterior spinal arteries and several radicular branches that feed the spinal arteries. The most important radicular branches are located at T1 and at the lower thoracic/upper lumbar levels. The latter is called the artery of Adamkiewicz. Cord ischaemia can occur, but anterior spinal artery syndrome usually only occurs with severe hypotension, and since surgery was uncomplicated this option is unlikely. The actual location where the artery of Adamkiewicz supplies the spinal arteries is not known. Therefore, aortic cross clamping exposes patients to the potential risk of distal spinal cord ischaemia even when the cross clamp time is short. Secondary damage to the cord can also occur during reperfusion."

For the purpose of the MRCP examination these are considered diagnostic of schizophrenia. In this case the patient has third person auditory hallucinations with running commentary. Covering his room with silver paper may be an attempt to stop thought broadcasting. The presence of urinary cannaboids may make you think about drug-induced psychosis. However the presence of first-rank symptoms precludes this diagnosis. In addition, cannabis has been linked with the development of schizophrenia, and cannabis may be used by patients suffering from schizophrenia to self-medicate. The first-rank symptoms also make encephalitis, hypomania and personality disorder unlikely. For treatment of acute psychosis, haloperidol or a rapidly dissolving formulation of olanzapine may be of value.

Trauma, such as due to fall from heights and road traffic accidents, are common causes of this fracture. These fractures commonly involve the roof of the orbits, the sphenoid bone, or portions of the temporal bone. The classical signs and symptoms of basal skull fracture include:  Periorbital haematoma (raccoon eyes) Subconjunctival haemorrhage where the posterior margins cannot be seen Battle's sign (post auricular bruising and blood behind the eardrum, although this sign may take 24-48 hours to develop in some patients) Rhinorrhoea/otorrhoea (blood mixed with CSF which does not clot; this is caused due to the damage to the cribriform plates).  The investigations for the diagnosis of suspected basal skull fracture (and of other serious head injuries) include CT and MRI scans. Indications for CT scan include:  A GCS less than 13 Unreliable history or examination due to alcohol and/or drug ingestion Loss of consciousness for more than 5 minutes Persisting/progressive headache and/or persistent vomiting Ante- and/or retrograde amnesia Clinical suspicion of basal skull fracture, and Skull fracture with neurological signs and/or convulsions.  Patients with GCS less than 8 have a risk of respiratory compromise and hence need to be intubated.

Inferiorly, the cord usually extends as far as the first lumbar intervertebral disc where it terminates as the conus medullaris. The pia mater is a highly vascular layer which closely invests the spinal cord and nerves, and surrounds the termination of the spinal cord (conus medullaris) and continues as the filum terminale as far as the posterior surface of the coccyx. The arachnoid membrane is continuous with the cranial arachnoid through the foramen magnum and below, it ends at the level of the second sacral vertebra. The spinal nerves are attached to the spinal cord by anterior and posterior nerve roots. The region of the spinal cord to which one pair of anterior and posterior nerve root attaches is called a spinal segment. The spinal cord receives its arterial supply from the anterior and posterior spinal arteries which arise from the vertebral arteries and are reinforced by branches of deep cervical, intercostal and lumbar arteries."
nervous system,212,A 6-month-old baby had loss of consciousness after which he had jerky movement of hands and feet. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Infantile spasm,Absence seizure,Partial simple seizure,Atonic seizure,Partial complex seizure,E,In partial simple seizer there is no LOC (loss of consciousness). Infantile spasm though may be associated with occasional LOC but its nature is more generalized rather than the focal nature described here. So the likely option is E. Partial complex seizure
nervous system,213,"An 82-year-old resident of a residential home was seen at the Emergency Department for restlessness and aggressive behaviour. He has been incontinent of urine and also had few falls. He was placed in the residential home after the death of his wife due to severe arthritis in his hands and knees. His only past medical history includes hypothyroidism, for which he takes thyroxine 50 µgrams per day. On examination, he is disorientated in time, place and person and smells strongly of urine. There are no focal neurological signs. What is the likely diagnosis?",Delirium,Dementia,Hypoglycaemia,Myxoedema madness,Transient ischaemic attack (TIA),A,"Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric syndrome in the elderly characterised by concurrent impairments in cognition and behaviour. There are numerous causes, but it is commonly associated with underlying medical illness and medication. Untreated it has significant morbidity and mortality. The cardinal features of delirium are recent onset of fluctuating awareness, impairment of memory and attention and disorganised thinking. Additional features may include visual hallucinations and disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle. Three subtypes are increasingly recognised: hypoactive, hyperactive and mixed. Delirium is a clinical diagnosis, but there are a number of assessment tools which can aid the clinician. The mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and abbreviated mental test score (AMTS) can assess cognition but not all features of delirium. Guidelines in both the UK and the USA recommend the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) for detecting delirium. The diagnosis requires criteria 1 and 2 to be present, plus either 3 or 4:  Acute onset and fluctuating course Inattention Disorganised thinking Altered level of consciousness.  This has been shown to have a sensitivity and specificity of over 90%. Distinguishing between delirium and dementia can be difficult, and often they coexist. It is safest to assume delirium is present, and attempt to find an underlying cause before settling on a diagnosis of dementia. Delirium should be avoided if possible by reducing the risk factors, in particularly predisposing medications. Orientating communication, therapeutic activities, early mobilisation, non-pharmacological approaches to sleep and anxiety, maintaining nutrition and hydration, adaptive equipment for vision and hearing impairment and pain management have also been shown to reduce the incidence. Immediate identification and treatment of precipitations, withdrawal of culprit drugs and supportive care (correction of hypoxia, hydration, nutrition, mobilisation) are critical in the treatment of delirium. Drug treatment should be reserved for patients who pose a risk to themselves or others. A patient on replacement thyroxine is unlikely to have severe hypothyroidism (myxoedema madness) as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) should have been regularly checked. However, non-compliance with medication is possible. All confused patients should be checked for hypoglycaemia, however, given the information available this is not the answer. TIA may present with confusion but dysphasia and weakness are prominent symptoms. "
nervous system,214,"A 70-year-old man presents with balance difficulties, vomiting and nausea. Which of the following is the best investigation?",MRI cerebellum,CT cerebellum,Skull XR,LP,Blood culture,A,"Balance difficulties, vomiting and nausea suggests cerebellar lesion. In posterior fossa lesion MRI is preferred"
nervous system,215,"A 58 year old gentleman who is known to drink excessively, presents with a 2 week history of a progressively worsening headache. This has been associated with nausea and vomiting. You notice he appears drowsy and forgetful and that he has a healing cut and bruising on his head. He states he has been told by his family that he is sleeping more than usual. On examination there is nil signs of meningism but you notice a 4/5 power on the left side. Which of the following is the most appropriate step in management?",IV antibiotics and lumbar puncture,CT head and lumbar puncture,CT head and neurosurgical referral,Antiemetic,Analgesia,C,"The most likely diagnosis is subdural haematoma. This gentleman has a history of alcohol excess and there is evidence of a previous head injury. These findings along with increasing headache and drowsiness are indicative. A focal neurological deficit may also be observed. Alcohol excess is a risk factor due to the associated coagulopathy. People on anticoagulants and coagulopathies are at increased risk. A coagulation screen is therefore useful. SDH is due to bleeding from bridging veins from cortex to venous sinuses, bleeding from a cortical artery or parenchymal injury. A CT head will confirm the diagnosis. A neurosurgical opinion should be obtained."
nervous system,216,A 65-year-old woman presented with transient arm and leg weakness as well as a sudden loss of vision in the left eye. Her symptoms resolved within the next couple of hours. What is the most appropriate next investigation?,CT brain,Echo,Doppler USG,Arteriography,24 hour ECG,C,Diagnosis is TIA. Probable cause is carotid narrowing from atherosclerosis
nervous system,217,"A 50 year old female has noticed loss of taste, facial weakness and hypersensitivity to sound.  On examination there is a left facial nerve palsy including the forehead and reduced sensation on the left side of the face. What structure is likely to be involved?",Cerebellopontine angle,Parotid gland,Cerebral cortex,Left Facial nerve,Auditory canal,A,"There is evidence of CN V, VII and VIII palsies.  There are in close association in the cerebellopontine angle  and thus this must be the site of the lesion.  Non e of the other options would explain all the clinical findings."
nervous system,218,A 50-year-old man with a known history of stroke. He can’t remember anything about his life. What is the single most likely defect?,Homonymous hemianopia,Homonymous upper quadrantanopia,Bitemporal hemianopia,Binasal hemianopia,Homonymous lower quadrantanopia,B,Memory processing occur in temporal lobe. So as the patient lost memory his temporal lobe is involved. We know temporal lobe lesion causes “homonymous upper quadrantanopia” which is the key here
nervous system,219,In Von Hippel Lindau disease what malignancy is she at increased risk of?,Renal cell carcinoma,Cutaneous neurofibroma,Small Cell Lung Cancer,Colorectal Carcinoma,Pancreatic carcinoma,A,"Renal Cell carcinoma is the correct answer.  The Von Hippel Lindau syndrome is associated with the development of cerebellar haemangioma, retinal angioma, pancreatic cysts, hepatic cysts.  It has an autosomal dominant inheritance and is associated with a mutation on the short arm of chromosome 3.  As well as RCC there is also increase risk of adrenal tumours."
nervous system,220,A 42-year-old man presents with stroke. He is not able to walk straight and his speech is slurred. What is the initial appropriate investigation?,CT brain,PET brain,MRI brain,Carotid angiography,Monitor for 24h,C,Ataxia and slurred speech are features of cerebellar lesion which is posterior fossa organ. For posterior fossa lesion MRI is the investigation of choice

The following day, whilst oblivious to the potentially dangerous situation, he reports remembering dreaming about fighting a bear. His father had experienced a similar event some years before being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),Lewy body dementia,Night terrors,REM sleep behaviour disorder,Schizophrenia,D,"Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder, is a parasomnia manifested by vivid dreams associated with simple or complex motor behaviour during REM sleep. Polysomnography demonstrates increased electromyographic tone and dream enactment, often associated with the violent re-enacting of dreams and occuring when the normal atonicity of REM sleep is lost. There is an association with the later development of movement disorders and these can be predicted by a number of years. Parkinson's disease in increasingly linked with REM sleep behaviour disorder. Making the situation safe is paramount but treatment with clonazepam is the intervention of choice. Counselling can also play a role. "
nervous system,222,"A 75-year-old man has been attending the clinic for lower urinary tract symptoms. His mood is very low and he says he feels unhappy, anxious and unable to sleep. He has been diagnosed with moderate depression. What treatment would be most effective for this patient?",Amitriptyline,Citalopram,CBT,Dosulepin,Diazepam,B,Moderate depression is treated with antidepressants. Amitryptiline and Dosulepine causes urinary retention (which is comperatively less in citalopram) so not suitable in a patient with lower urinary symptoms. Hence Citalopram is the preferred option
nervous system,223,An 81-year-old male presents with difficulty coping at home and is found to be depressed. Which one of the following statements regarding this patient is correct?,Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) would usually be avoided if he had a recent cerebrovascular accident,He is unlikely to have had previous episodes of depression,Monoamine oxidase inhibitors are the most appropriate treatment for this patient,Somatic symptoms would be an unexpected feature,Suicide would be unlikely in a patient of this age,A,"ECT may result in seizures, cerebral ischaemia and cardiac arrhythmias. In the elderly confusion and falls may also occur. Although ECT has been safely used one month following a stroke, it is advisable to avoid treatment in the first three months. Most guidelines state that a recent CVA (within 1 to 3 months) is a contraindication. Somatic complaints and previous depressive illness are common. Suicide rates in males of this age group are significantly above the national average. Monoamine oxidase(MAO) inhibitors are not the drugs of choice in the elderly due to the risk of side effects including severe hypertension."
nervous system,224,Which of the following demographic factors is associated with a higher than normal risk of completed suicide?,Age below 35 years,Female sex,Marriage,Socio-economic group 1,Unemployment,E,"Deliberate self harm (DSH) is significantly more common than completed suicide. For every 100 patients admitted to hospital following self harm, one will complete suicide within a year (Key topics in psychiatry 1996). The demography and risk factors for deliberate self harm are often different from those for suicide. Unemployment and low socio-economic groups are consistently associated with a higher risk of suicide than those with employment or in higher socio-economic groups. Older males are considered at higher risk of completed suicide whilst younger women are considered the 'typical' profile for someone committing self harm (however DSH rates in younger men have risen considerably in recent years, closing the gap). Marriage is one of the strongest protective factors against completed suicide, with men tending to benefit more than women."

nervous system,228,A 73-year-old man with established Parkinson's disease presents with recent onset of paranoia and visual hallucinations. He is being treated with levodopa and a dopamine agonist. His cognitive function is satisfactory and apart from hypertension he is otherwise medically well. Which of the following options would be the best treatment strategy for this man?,Add in a benzodiazepine,Commence an atypical antipsychotic at low dose,Discontinue his antihypertensive,Gradually reduce the dose of levodopa,Withdraw the dopamine agonist,E,"Patients with Parkinson's disease are susceptible to iatrogenic psychotic symptoms. Unlike levodopa, dopamine agonists do not have to be modified by brain enzymes to activate dopamine receptors and are more likely to cause psychotic symptoms. Withdrawal of the dopamine agonist is often accompanied by improvement in the psychosis. A reduction of dopamine stimulation should be tried prior to initiating antipsychotic agents. Discontinuing the antihypertensive agent is unlikely to be of benefit. Adding in a benzodiazepine may lead to addiction or dependence when it is not needed.  "
nervous system,229,"A 67 year old male presents to her GP with two months of back pain.  He is given analgesia however one week later he is admitted to A+E with bilateral leg weakness and urinary retention.  He has recently lost a significant amount of weight.  He is a heavy smoker.  On examination his arms are hyperreflexic.  He has 4/5 in hip and knee flexors.  He has upgoing plantars and is hyperreflexic and has reduced sensation throughout all dermatomes of the lower limbs.

He is extremely shy and on examination he is hypotonic. Which single investigation should be carried out next?",MRI abdo,CT head,Serum urea,Chromosomal analysis,Echocardiogram,D,"This child has fragile X syndrome. It is the second most common known cause of mental retardation, and the most common inheritable cause. Common symptoms and signs include prominent ears, a long face, high palate, hyperflexibilty, flat feet, macroorchidism after puberty, hypotonia and autism. Chromosomal analysis diagnoses the condition."
nervous system,232,A patient you are seeing in the ENT clinic has recently had some dental surgery performed and asks you for some advice about symptoms she has experienced since. On examination you see that a lower third molar has been removed. Which nerve has been damaged?,Auriculotemporal nerve,Chorda tympani,Hypoglossal nerve,Inferior alveolar nerve,Marginal mandibular nerve,D,The lower third molars often have roots in close proximity to the inferior alveolar nerve. This nerve enters the mandible at the mandibular foramen and exits at the mental foramen. The inferior alveolar nerve supplies sensation to the lower teeth on half of the dental arch as well as sensation to one side of the chin and lower lip.
nervous system,233,A 35-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia is brought to the ER by his friends due to drowsiness. On examination he is generally rigid. A diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome can be made excepting:,Renal failure,Pyrexia,Elevated creatinine kinase,Usually occurs after prolonged treatment,Tachycardia,D,"Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a life-threatening reaction that can occur in response to neuroleptic or antipsychotic medication. Symptoms include high fever, confusion, rigid muscles, variable blood pressure, sweating, and fast heart rate.

How is this normally described?,Thought revolving,Thought broadcasting,Echophonia,Thought echo,Thought multiplication,D,Thought echo is the repetition of a thought by a voice in the patients head.
nervous system,235,"A 24 year old female has a history of migraines.  On a visit to her optician who notes that one of her pupils is larger than the other and does not react to light.  There is no abnormal findings in eye movement, acuity or fundoscopy. Which of the following explains her pupillary findings?",Third cranial nerve palsy,Horners Syndrome,Argyll Robertson pupil,Brain Tumour,Holmes Adie pupil,E,The most likely diagnosis here is a Holmes Adie pupil which is very common in young females and is often seen with diminished knee and ankle reflexes.  Horners and third cranial nerve palsy would be associated with other eye findings.  A brain tumour would not cause abnormal pupillary response without other neurological features.  Argyll Robertson pupil secondary to syphilis leads to small normally bilateral pupils.
nervous system,236,"A 31-year-old single man lives with his mother. He usually drives to work. He always thinks when the traffic lights change, his mother is calling him, so he drives back home. What is the diagnosis?",OCD,GAD,Schizophrenia,Bipolar,Cyclothymia,C,The deliusionmetioned is delusion of perception - he thinks that the changing traffic lights are giving message to him and this is often seen in schizophrenic patients (one of the 1st rank symptom)
nervous system,237,"A 50-year-old business man who has been drinking heavily for at least two years, states that he drinks alcohol on his way into work as he suffers from anxiety attacks. Which one of the following statements is true regarding his anxiety?",Alcohol will not improve or worsen the symptoms of anxiety,"It indicates alcohol dependence, and after initial worsening with withdrawal usually will improve after three weeks of abstinence from alcohol","It indicates alcohol dependence, and is likely to persistently deteriorate after three weeks of abstinence from alcohol",It is a symptom of schizophrenia,It is factious,B,"This gentleman is dependent on alcohol and when withdrawing in the morning he is experiencing anxiety. This is one of the common symptoms of mild alcohol withdrawal, which can also lead to agitation, fever, sweats and tremor. All these symptoms are relieved by alcohol initially. However, if patients continue to abstain from alcohol they usually peak after about 72 hours and may last a week or more, but usually have resolved by 3 weeks."
nervous system,238,A couple attends their GP because of marital problems. The wife states that her husband is having affairs although she has no proof of this. The husband states that she even had him followed by a private detective and this is putting considerable strain on their marriage. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Fregoli syndrome,Cotard syndrome,Mood disorder,Ekbom syndrome,Othello syndrome,E,"Othello syndrome is delusion of infidelity (cheating, adultery, or having an affair) of a spouse or partner"
nervous system,239,Which of the following is true concerning the interscalene block?,It blocks the brachial plexus at the level of the trunks and proximal divisions,It has the highest risk of pneumothorax of any brachial plexus block,It may result in an ipsilateral Horner's syndrome,The interscalene block often spares the radial aspect of the forearm,The key landmark is the interscalene groove which is located between the middle and posterior scalenus muscles,C,"An interscalene block anaesthetises the brachial plexus at the level of its roots, and reliably blocks the shoulder and radial aspect of the forearm. It is often associated with sparing in the ulnar nerve territory (not radial). The key landmark for performing this block is the interscalene groove, which is located between the anterior and middle scalenus muscles. At least half of patients having an interscalene block develop Horner's syndrome on the same side (ipsilateral). One of the main advantages of the interscalene block is that pneumothorax is avoided, and the supraclavicular block is associated with the highest risk of pneumothorax."
nervous system,240,What is the approximate distance between the pia and arachnoid mater in the thoracic region?,1 mm,3 mm,5 mm,9 mm,12 mm,B,"In the cervical and thoracic regions of the spinal cord the subarachnoid space is annular. The distance between the pia and arachnoid mater in the thoracic region is approximately 3 mm, the pia mater is adherent to the spinal cord. The spinal cord terminates at the lower border of L1 (or upper border of L2 in some texts). At this point, the subarachnoid space becomes circular and has a diameter of approximately 15 mm."
nervous system,241,What pathological abnormalities is found in Parkinsons disease?,Contrast Enhancing Lesions,Lesions in White matter,Lewy bodies,Neurofibrillary tangles,Mallory bodies,C,Lewy bodies are characteristically seen in Parkinsons disease.  Lewy bodies are a cytoplasmic inclusion with a core and a halo composed of neurofilaments.  Neurofibrillary tangles are seen in Alzheimers disease and white matter lesion typically seen in MS.
nervous system,242,The mother of a 22-year-old woman phones you distressed about her daughter's behaviour. She wonders if she could have a borderline personality disorder. Which of the following features would be consistent with this diagnosis?,Dramatic or grandiose behaviour,Excessive attempts to avoid abandonment,Frequent minor illnesses,Obsessional thoughts about contamination,Refusing to leave her room,B,"Borderline personality disorder is characterised by frequent deliberate self-harm or suicide attempts, excessive attempts to avoid perceived abandonment (usually by a close family member or a partner), and difficulty sustaining relationships. Dramatic or grandiose behaviour is a feature of histrionic personality disorder. Obsessional thoughts about contamination are a common feature of OCD. Refusal to leave a room may be a feature of an anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, or a psychotic disorder but is not a typical feature of borderline personality disorder. "
nervous system,243,A 50 year old female is having recurrent falls.  She feels this is secondary to weak legs and finds it difficulty to walk up stairs or get up from a chair.  He has no significant PMH except he is on ramipril for hypertension.  On examination he has 4/5 power in knee extension bilaterally and in hand grip.  There is nil else of note. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Subacute degeneration of the Cord,Limb Girdle muscular dystrophy,Multiple Sclerosis,Inclusion body myositis,Cervical cord compression,D,The most likely diagnosis is Inclusion body myositis as it characteristically affects the quadriceps and finger flexors.  These findings are unlikely to be MS.  Cervical cord compression would also lead to sensory symptoms.  Subacute degeneration of the cord would not lead to the reduced hand grip and would lead to hyperreflexic knees and absent ankle reflexes.  Limb girdle muscular dystrophy leads to proximal weakness.
nervous system,244,A 25 year old female presents with a one week history left eye ache and visual blurring.  She has a left relative afferent pupillary reflex and the optic nerve appears swollen.  She has no PMH and is only taking the COC. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Optic Neuritis secondary to ischaemia,Optic Neuritis secondary to demyelination,Macular Degeneration,Acute closed angle glaucoma,Conjunctivitis,B,The most likely diagnosis is demyelination leading to optic neuritis i.e. MS.  The relative afferent pupillary reflect is very indicative of this. It also leads to pain on movement of eye.  Red often appears duller.  It is less likely to be glaucoma due to lack of eye findings and no systemic features.   Conjunctivitis just not lead to these findings.  Macular degeneration is unlikely due to the age of the patient and the pain in the eye.  An ischaemic cause is less likely as it was not a sudden onset despite the history of the COC.
nervous system,245,"A 68 year old female presents as she has been having trouble sleeping for several months. She states in the evening when she is sitting watching TV or during the night which wakes her from her sleep, she suffers odd sensations in her legs and has the urge to move them which relieves the sensation for a short while. She is otherwise in good health. What might you commonly find on bloods?",Deranged LFTs,Low TSH and elevated free T4,Hypocalcaemia,Iron Deficiency,Hypokalaemia,D,"This history is highly indicative of restless leg syndrome. It can be idiopathic but is also associated with many conditions such as iron deficiency anaemia, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism and pregnancy. Restless leg syndrome can be triggered by peripheral neuropathy or radiculopathy and although the sensory symptoms may be similar there is often no incessant meed to move the legs and it is not worse at rest or night. In leg cramps, pain is predominant and patient describe cramps. In intermittent claudication pain is worsened by movement.  FBC, Us and Es, haematinics, TFTs, magnesium and glucose levels should be measured. In general in mild cases advice should be given avoid nicotine, alcohol and caffeine as this can worsen the symptoms. Medications such as SSRIs can be associated and therefore these should be stopped. In those with severe symptoms which is interfering with sleep etc. then dopamine agonists or levodopa are utilised first line for example ropinirole. It has been suggested that bromocriptine, cabergoline and pergolide may no longer be useful as they have been associated with pulmonary, retroperitoneal, and pericardial fibrotic reactions. Baseline Echocardiography and CXR and regular monitoring such as ESR and creatinine is required. Second line treatments include anticonvulsants, benzodiazepines, opiates and clonidine. Iron deficiency should be corrected."
nervous system,246,What is the most common presenting symptom of anorexia nervosa?,Damaged teeth,Peripheral oedema,Social isolation,Amenorrhoea,Excessive physical activity,E,"The ICD 10 diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa includes a bodyweight 15% below the expected weight for the patients height, avoidance of food, excessive exercise, vomiting, use of appetite suppressants, distorted body image, amenorrhoea or low libido in men and delayed onset of pubery (if younger). The earliest symptom tends to be excessive exercise as the others take longer to develop."
nervous system,247,"A 24 year old patient presents to her GP. She is complaining of flashing lights in her left eye. She is also complaining of tingling and numbness in her right hand which then spread up to her arm and face. This has occurred twice previously and was followed by a severe headache affecting one side of her head with the only relief being lying in a dark room. Apart from NSAIDs, which of the following is also useful for the acute management?",Amitriptyline,Triptans,Paracetamol,Propanolol,Ergometrine,B,"This history is highly indicative of migraine with aura. NSAIDs and antiemetics are given in the first instance however triptans can be utilised. Triptans are selective stimulators of 5 hydroxytryptamine,. They should be given in moderate to severe cases. There is a risk of rebound headache in 48 hours. Oral analgesia should be given early as migraines lead to gastric stasis.  Ergometrine has fallen from favour. Propanolol and amitriptyline are used for prophylaxis and not in the acute management."
nervous system,248,What receptor does buspirone exert it action?,Histamine,Noradrenaline,Serotonin,Adenosin,GABA,C,Buspirone acts on serotonin receptors. It is used in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder and has a favourable side effect profile with low addictiveness.
nervous system,249,Which of the following is a biological feature of depression?,Derailment,Early morning wakening,Low mood,Negativism,Thought block,B,"Symptoms of depression include low mood, negative ideation including suicidality, biological symptoms and in severe cases, psychosis. Biological symptoms include early morning wakening, loss of appetite and libido, although many textbooks include poor concentration, anhedonia and easy fatigability as biological symptoms. Biological symptoms are considered specific to depression but may lose specificity when a patient has symptoms of medical illness. Derailment and thought block are forms of thought disorder associated with schizophrenia. Negativism is a symptom of catatonia. Only early morning wakening is a biological feature of depression."
nervous system,250,A 68 year old female is brought to her GP by her husband. He states she has become very forgetful of late and is unable to concentrate. He has also noticed over the last few months that she is incontinent of urine and has been walking in an unusual way. On examination there is evidence of gait apraxia and her reflexes are brisk. A CT is performed and shows ventricular dilatation. Which of the following is a definitive treatment?,Donepezil,Acetazolamide,Levodopa,Repeat lumbar punctures,CSF shunt,E,"Normal pressure hydrocephalus is the most likely diagnosis as it presents with the triad of dementia, gait abnormalities an urinary incontinence. In NPH there is ventricular enlargement without an increase in intracranial pressure. A CT or MRI will reveal ventricular dilatation. A large volume lumbar puncture is useful for the diagnosis. Neuropsychology and physiotherapy assessment are performed before and after a large volume of CSF is drawn off and if there is an improvement in these parameters then this is highly indicative. On fundoscopy there is no evidence of papilloedema. Medical management with acetazolamide and repeated lumbar puncture are useful however a CSF shunt is a more definitive management."
nervous system,251,A 28-year-old male motorcyclist is admitted to the Emergency Unit following a road traffic collision. On examination he is suspected to have a high sciatic nerve injury. Which of the following is associated with a high sciatic nerve injury?,An inability to stand on the heels of the affected foot,Loss of knee jerk,Loss of sensation along the medial border of the foot,Normal ankle jerk,Normal power of knee flexion,A,"With a high sciatic nerve injury there is inability to stand on heel or toes, but walking is possible. The knee jerk is mediated by L3, femoral nerve - quadriceps femoris. This area is supplied by the saphenous nerve, a branch of the femoral nerve. This also supplies the medial lower leg. A sciatic lesion causes anaesthesia of the whole foot (except the medial border) and posterolateral calf in the lower two thirds (the upper one third of the posterior calf is supplied by the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve). The ankle jerk is mediated by S1, sciatic nerve - gastrocnemius. Knee flexion is markedly reduced because of paralysis of the hamstrings. A low injury, close to its division into tibial and common peroneal nerves at the apex of the popliteal fossa, will preserve hamstring function."
nervous system,252,A 22-year-old woman presented following an overdose. She had had an argument with her boyfriend and had then driven to an isolated country lane where she had swallowed 20 paracetamol tablets and a bottle of wine. Which one of the following is the strongest predictor that she may later make a fatal suicide attempt?,Female gender ,Location of the suicide attempt ,Taking alcohol with the tablets ,The argument with the boyfriend ,The number of tablets ,B,"About one-third of people who attempt suicide will repeat the attempt within one year, and about 10% of those who threaten or attempt suicide eventually do kill themselves. There are certain characteristics that have been found in those who are more likely to repeat an attempted suicide. These characteristics include  Age of 45 or more The fact of being male A previous attempt which resulted in hospital admission Problems with drugs or alcohol Suffering from a personality disorder Living alone (especially if separated, divorced, or widowed) Previous history of psychiatric treatment Criminal record Unemployment  Lower social class.  Relational pathology, for example an ongoing difficulty with her relationship with her boyfriend, is also a recognised factor for repeat suicide attempts. The fact that we do not know whether she has ongoing relationship problems means that we cannot class this as the strongest predictor of future suicidal intent. Thus, the fact that she drove to an isolated area where there was little chance of her being found suggests that this is a serious attempt at suicide which predicts future suicidal intent."

nervous system,254,"A 73-year-old man who is recovering from surgery on the left carotid artery in his neck. He has slurred speech. On protrusion of his tongue, the tip deviated to the left. What is the single most appropriate option?",Accessory nerve,Facial nerve,Glossopharyngeal nerve,Hypoglossal nerve,Vagus nerve,D,"Testing function of the nerve is performed by asked the subject to stick their tongue straight out. If there is a loss of innervation to one side, the tongue will curve toward the affected side, due to unopposed action of the opposite genioglossus muscle. If this is the result of a lower motor neuron lesion, the tongue will be curved towards the damaged side, combined with the presence of fasciculations or atrophy. However, if the deficit is caused by an upper motor neuron lesion, the tongue will be curved away from the side of the cortical damage, without the presence of fasciculations or atrophy"

nervous system,259,A 71 year old male with parkinson's disease has recently had his co-careldopa dose increased as his GP thought there had been a worsening of his symptoms. He is also on ropinirole. He is then referred as things have gotten worse since his medication has been increased. He appears to be suffering from dyskinesia. Which of the following is the most appropriate action you would take?,Reduce co-careldopa and maximise dopamine agonist,Add in Selegiline,Add in Amantadine,Reduce co-careldopa and switch ropinirole to pramipexole,Stop co-careldopa and maximise dopamine agonist,A,This patient was most likely suffering from dyskinesia. This is a long term problem with the use of levo dopa. The first option is to reduce the levo dopa dose. However unfortunately this  often leads to a worsening of the Parkinson's symptoms. Options include the use of a slow release formulation and minimising the levo dopa dose and maximising the dopamine agonist. Amantadine has been useful in a few but this is normally only a slight improvement which is short lived. Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors such as entacapone and selegiline are often more useful for wearing off phenomenon and in fact selegiline may increase risk of dyskinesia.

nervous system,264,"A 76-year-old man attended the outpatient clinic for a routine follow up appointment. He had presented to hospital with acute dyspnoea six months previously and had been diagnosed with severe aortic regurgitation. During his admission he had undergone aortic valve replacement with a mechanical valve. During the consultation he does not report any residual dyspnoea or ankle swelling. His INR is stable and is checked regularly by his general practitioner. His only complaint is of difficulty sleeping, which he says started when his wife died suddenly one year previously. He wakes at 4 am and has difficulty getting back to sleep. He lives alone and has no enjoyment in life since the death of his wife. In recounting his wife's death he is very tearful and says that he often cries without any apparent reason. What would be the best choice of antidepressant in this case?",Amitriptyline ,Citalopram ,Fluoxetine,St John's wort,Venlafaxine ,B,"Warfarin has a narrow therapeutic index which is affected by a number of drugs, primarily through the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, as may the serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine. However, current data suggests that sertraline and citalopram appear to be the safest antidepressants to prescribe with warfarin. Fluvoxamine and fluoxetine appear to pose the highest potential risk. The remaining antidepressants appear to lie somewhere in between. St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum), a herbal antidepressant available over the counter in the United Kingdom, reduces the anticoagulant effect of warfarin and concomitant use should be avoided. In cases of true depression, as here, an antidepressant is indicated. Tricyclic antidepressants are used much less frequently now, as safer antidepressants have been introduced. Their use in cardiac patients is associated with a number of potential complications, due to antimuscarinic and quinidine-like properties. There is a dose-dependent increase in the plasma half-life of warfarin. Venlafaxine has been reported to enhance warfarin, and it must be used with caution in patients with cardiac disease. As with tricyclics, NICE recommends that it should not be used in patients with a high risk of serious cardiac arrhythmias or a recent myocardial infarction. "

Which one of the following statements is correct?,Associated dementia is unlikely ,Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is likely to improve her mood,"If she recovers, relapse is unlikely",The risk of suicide is low,Underlying physical illness is unlikely,B,Depression in the elderly is a widespread problem that is often not diagnosed and frequently under-treated. Depression can also be a sign of a medical problem. It may be complicated by brain disorders associated with the ageing process such as Alzheimer's disease. Suicide risk in the elderly is an important consideration and is at least as common as in younger age groups. Relapse of depressive symptoms is common in the elderly. ECT is indicated in patients who derive no benefit from antidepressant medication.
nervous system,269,"A 73-year-old man is admitted to the care of the elderly ward with acute confusion and a likely urinary tract infection. You are asked to see him because he has hit out at some of the nursing staff, refused to take his oral medication, and told them that they were trying to poison him. He has a past history of ischaemic heart disease and asthma, and takes a number of medications. Latest observations reveal that he is pyrexial 38.9C, his BP is 100/60, and pulse is 92 and regular. He has pulled out his IV line and tries to hit you as you go near him. Bloods taken on admission have revealed elevated white count, CRP of 220 mg/L (mg/L (less than10) and a creatinine of 95 µmol/l, (60-110). Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention? ",Chlorpromazine,Donepezil,Haloperidol,Lorazepam,Risperidone,C,"The answer is Haloperidol. The most likely diagnosis in this gentleman is delirium, as a result of a urinary tract infection. Haloperidol is considered the initial first line intervention under NICE guidelines for patients with delirium who are not responsive to verbal and non-verbal techniques to de-escalate the situation. It is clear that without an IV line, he will not be receiving IV antibiotics or fluids, and he is at risk of falling. He is, therefore, a risk to both himself and ward staff, and for both these reasons pharmacological intervention is indicated. Chlorpromazine is associated with increased risk of cardiac arrhythmia, and atypical antipsychotics, such as risperidone, are not recommended. Lorazepam is an alternative to haloperidol, particularly where there is a history of Parkinson's or Lewy body disease, but tends to be shorter acting and is not recommended in the first-line setting. Donepezil, although effective in the treatment of dementia, is not recommended for the treatment of delirium.

Which one of the following movements would you expect to be weak in this patient?,Abduction of the thumb,Adduction of the thumb,Extension of the little finger,Flexion of the index finger,Opposition of the thumb,B,"The clinical features suggest an ulnar neuropathy. The ulnar nerve supplies the hypothenar muscles (opponens digiti minimi, abductor digiti minimi, flexor digiti minimi), the third and fourth lumbricals, dorsal and palmar interossei and adductor pollicis. It also provides sensory innervation to the fifth digit and medial half of the fourth digit. Abduction and opposition of the thumb and flexion of the index finger are via the median nerve. Extension of the little finger is via the radial nerve.    Thumb adduction is primarily by the adductor pollicis muscle."

From here the nerve divides into the anterior and posterior branch which are separated by the adductor brevis muscle."
nervous system,277,An 82-year-old male with longstanding Alzheimer's dementia presents as his carers are concerned about his increased episodes of aggression. Physically he is well. Which is the most appropriate treatment for his aggressive outbursts?,Diazepam,Quetiapine,Risperidone,Temazepam,Valproate,C,"Ideally, aggression in Alzheimer's disease should be managed with non-drug approaches, aiming to identify and avoid triggers and finding behavioural techniques which manage the symptoms. However, sometimes drug treatment is required.  Atypical neuroleptics, such as quietapine, and haloperidol are not recommended as there is an increased risk of death or stroke. There is also concern that these agents may contribute to cognitive decline, and it is recognised that symptoms often relapse after cessation of haloperidol. However, risperidone has been tested in this setting and is licensed for 6 weeks treatment of persistent aggression in those with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease, providing that non-pharmacological alternatives have been tried and there is a risk of harm.  Valproate has been widely used for its calming effects in this situation, but there is little evidence of the efficacy of valproate. Benzodiazepines are not recommended, as they can impair alertness and increase daytime sleepiness (thereby increasing the risk of falls), and are also associated with worsening cognitive decline.

The other options would not account for the signs described. Due to the sudden onset and severity a haemorrhage is more likely than an infarct.
nervous system,285,Regarding extradural haematoma which ONE of the following is correct?,Limited by suture lines,Not usually associated with a skull fracture,Typically biconcave on a CT scan,Usually associated with lucid interval,Usually due to damage to the posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery,A,"Extradural haematoma is usually due to damage to the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery. Because the dura has strong attachments to the cranium along the suture lines, contrary to subdural haematomas, extradural haematomas are limited by the suture lines. Due to this feature they have a characteristic biconvex appearance on a CT scan. Though the majority are associated with a skull fracture this is not always the case; it could result from a direct local impact (coup) without a fracture. Frequently the initial injury is not severe, often a blow to the temporal regions (for example, with a cricket ball) where the relatively thin skull overlies the meningeal artery could lead to an extradural haematoma. The well-described 'lucid interval' of an extradural haematoma is in fact less common than most of us have been taught. It occurs in less than 20% of patients. The majority of patients progressively deteriorate from the time of injury."

nervous system,296,Which is true of the neurological system?,A complete CN III palsy will cause the affected eye to be turned outwards and upwards,A lesion of the cerebellopontine angle will produce a CN VII lesion with sparing of the frontalis muscle,A positive Rinne's test indicates the presence of conductive deafness,Quadrantic hemianopia is associated with lesions of the parietal lobe,Sensation to the anterior 2/3rds of the tongue will be lost in a lesion of the glossopharyngeal nerve,D,"In CN III palsy the affected eye will deviate down and out with a dilated pupil often unreactive to light and accommodation. Complete or partial ptosis may also be present. Lesions in the cerebellopontine angle are often caused by an acoustic neuroma. The frontalis is spared in all upper motor neurone lesions involving cranial nerve VII, not in this case. A positive Rinne's test is when air conduction is better than bone conduction, a normal result. A negative Rinne's test indicates the presence of conductive deafness. Parietal lesions cause lower quadratic hemianopia whilst temporal lesions cause upper quadrantic hemianopia. The facial nerve supplies the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. "
nervous system,297,"A 6-month-old child is brought to the Emergency Department having fallen off a chair the previous day. The child appears clinically well, but he has a boggy occipital swelling. Which of the following would be the appropriate action?",Arrange urgent head CT,"Confront the parents as you suspect this is a non-accidental injury, given the delay in presenting to hospital",Discharge after warning the parents that suspicions about possible child abuse have been aroused,Discharge and arrange an appointment at the next paediatric clinic,Discharge and notify the duty social worker,A,"This scenario describes a baby with possible non-accidental injury. The child presents having fallen off a chair. It is important to ascertain why a baby of 6 months was sitting on a chair unsupervised. The presentation is also delayed. The baby has sustained a fracture and will therefore need to be observed and monitored. He also needs to be in a place of safety until social service investigations have been carried out. The boggy swelling suggests a fracture, so a CT head scan needs to be carried out. He also needs a skeletal survey. "
nervous system,298,A 72 year old male presents to GP with a three day history of severe right earache.  He describes this as a burning sensation in the ear.  He is also suffering from vertigo and loss of taste.   On examination there is a right sided facial weakness. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Stroke,Otitis media,Ramsay Hunt syndrome,Cholesteatoma,Cerebellopontine angle tumour,C,The most likely diagnosis is the Ramsay Hunt syndrome which is due to herpes zoster viral infection of the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve and invasion of the eighth nerve ganglia.  Thus leading to the above signs and symptoms.  CPA tumour would lead to some of the symptoms but not the severe earache.  These clinical findings could occur with cholesteatoma but you would expect a discharge from the ear.
nervous system,299,A 25-year-old girl saw a tragic RTA in which a young boy was killed. The night of the event she couldn’t sleep and the day after she suddenly lost her vision. She was previously fine and there was no history of medical or psychological problems. What is the diagnosis?,Conversion,Somatization,PTSD,Dissociation,GAD,A,"Conversion reaction is sometimes applied to patients who present with neurological symptoms, such as numbness, blindness, paralysis, or fits, which are not consistent with a well-established organic cause, and which cause significant distress. It is thought that these symptoms arise in response to stressful situations affecting a patient's mental health"
nervous system,300,Which of the following is the best example of a simple vocal tic as might be seen in Tourette's Syndrome?,Grunting,Premonitory sensations,Repeating the same phrase over and over,Shouting obscenities,Teeth grinding,A,Simple vocal tics are noises such as grunting or clearing the throat. Complex vocal tics are words or phrases and may include shouting obscenities (coprolalia) or repeating the same phrase over and over (palilalia). Premonitory sensations are unpleasant feelings which occur before having a tic and are relieved by carrying out the tic. Teeth grinding is also known as bruxism and is not a vocal tic. 
nervous system,301,"A 50-year-old man presents with low mood, poor concentration, anhedonia and insomnia. He has had 2 episodes of increased activity, promiscuity and aggressive behavior in the past. He was arrested 8 months ago for trying to rob a bank claiming it as his own. Which drug is most likely to benefit him?",Haloperidol,Citalopram,Desipramine,Carbamazepine,Ethosuximide,D,It is a case of bipolar disorder. Mainstay of treatment is mood stabilizers such as i) Lithium carbonate ii) Anticonvulsant medicines iii) Antipsychotic medicines. So from the given options Carbamazepine is the most appropriate drug
nervous system,302,Regarding benign essential tremor which of the following is true?,Alcohol improves the tremor,Is autosomal recessive in inheritance,Is present characteristically at rest ,Occurs in liver disease,Occurs with lesion in sub thalamus,A,"There is no tremor at rest, but a rhythmic oscillation develops when the patient holds the arms outstretched. A positive family history is obtained in over half of such patients and the pattern of inheritance in such families indicates an autosomal dominant trait. Alcohol suppresses essential tremor, but the mechanism responsible is unknown. The tremor associated with liver disease occurs in decompensated cirrhotic liver disease and is associated with encephalopathy. It is a flapping of the out stretched hand compared to essential tremor which is exacerbated by performing a task."
nervous system,303,A 25 year old male who is a personal trainer presents to his GP with cramps in his legs. He states he notices the muscles in his calves twitching. He notices these get worse after excercise and when he is tired. These symptoms have been present for several months and not progressed. He is otherwise fit and well. On examination there is evidence of fasciculations in his calves however the rest of his neurological examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Inclusion Body Myositis,Biochemical Abnormality,Motor Neurone Disease,Benign cramp fasciculation syndrome,Becker's Muscular Dystrophy,D,The history and clinical findings are indicative of benign cramp fasciculation syndrome. In motor neurone disease you would expect there to be evidence of muscle wasting and brisk reflexes. Weakness can occur following onset of fasciculations. You would also expect the symptoms and signs to progress unlike in benign cramp fasciculation syndrome. Inclusion body myositis presents with distal weakness. In Becker's muscle dystrophy there would be wasting and weakness of muscles and the disease progresses.
nervous system,304,A young man complains of double vision on seeing to the right. Which nerve is most likely to be involved?,Left abducens,Right abducens,Left trochlear,Right trochlear,Right oculomotor,B,Diplopia on seeing to right indicates right lateral rectus palsy which is supplied by right abducent nerve
nervous system,305,A 45 year old female presents to her GP as she is worried about a tremor in her left hand that is worse when she is doing things. Her mother had a similar tremor. The rest of her examination is unremarkable. She is commenced on propanolol however cannot tolerate the side effects. What is an alternative management?,Amantadine,Procyclidine,Primidone,l-Dopa,Reassure,C,"Due to the tremor which is worsened by action and finding of no other abnormalities this is likely to be benign essential tremor which is often responsive to a beta blocker, some find a small amount of alcohol is useful. Primidone has also been useful. It can have a genetic predisposition and seems to be autosomal dominant. It is unlike Parkinsons tremor which is a tremor which occurs at rest and does not respond to alcohol. It can affect the head, tongue and legs."
nervous system,306,A 23-year-old man presents with longstanding involuntary vocal and motor tics. Which of the following other features of his presentation is most likely to be part of Tourette's syndrome?,Cataplexy,Coprophagy,Echolalia,Hyperactivity,Skin picking,C,Recognised feature of Tourette's syndrome (TS) include echolalia (repeating what someone else has just said) and coprolalia (compulsive swearing). Hyperactivity may be associated with TS as part of an ADHD syndrome. Cataplexy is a medical condition in which strong emotion causes sudden physical collapse without loss of consciousness. It is linked with narcolepsy. Coprophagy (the eating of faeces) is likely to be linked with either severe mental disturbance or a severe learning disability. Skin picking may be a simple habit or be an impulse as part of a compulsive disorder. 
nervous system,307,Which of the following reflexes and innervating spinal nerves are correctly paired?,Anal reflex – S1,Ankle jerk – L5,Biceps jerk – C7 & C8,Knee jerk – L3 & L4,Triceps jerk – T1,D,Anal reflex – S2-4; Ankle jerk – S1-2; Biceps jerk – C5-6; Knee jerk – L3-4; Triceps jerk – C7
nervous system,308,"A 56-year-old woman with MS (multiple sclerosis) presents with drooping of the left side of her lips. She also has loss of sensation over her face, hearing impairment and some in
-coordination of her movements. What is the most likely anatomical site affected?",Cerebellum,Cerebrum,Spinal cord,Brain stem,Optic nerve,D,"Features of 5, 7, 8th cranial nerve and cerebellar involvement are suggestive of brainstem lesion"
nervous system,309,A 63-year-old female is noted to have left pupil irresponsive to light and is dilated. What is the most probably diagnosis?,Pontine hemorrhage,Subdural hemorrhage,Cerebellar hemorrhage,Extradural hemorrhage,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,B,"In elderly extradural hemorrhage is unlikely and subdural hemorrhage is more common.Traumatic expanding subdural hematomas may present with third nerve involvement and are usually accompanied by additional neurological dysfunction. Dilated, sluggish, or fixed pupil (s), bilateral or ipsilateral to the injury occur due to increased intracranial pressure (ICP) or transtentorial herniation"
nervous system,310,An 81 year old female has become increasingly forgetful over the last 9 months. There is nil to note on examination.  Which of the following features suggests early Alzheimers disease?,Disinhibition,Word finding difficulties,Hallucination,Disorientation in space and time,Drowsiness,B,"Word finding difficulties is the correct answer as Alzheimers disease commonly presents with progressive memory loss with word findings difficulties, anomia and impaired visuospatial skills.  Hallucinations implies Lewy body dementia and disinhibition due to frontal involvement."
nervous system,311,When assessing a patient with Alzheimers for starting an Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor what would be the most likely reason to make them eligible for treatment?,Duration of Illness,MMSE Score,Age,Carers thoughts,Co existent Hypertension,B,NICE recommends Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil or rivastigmine should be utilised in mild to moderate dementia i.e. an MMSE score of 10 to 20 or above and can only be commenced in specialised clinics.
nervous system,312,Which of the following is correct regarding raised intracranial pressure after head injury?,Can lead to irregular respiration,Causes constriction of the ipsilateral pupil,Causes hemiparesis of the ipsilateral side,Results in rise in pulse rate and fall in blood pressure,The pressure usually rises immediately after severe head injury,A,"In the early stages of head injury there is a non-linear relationship between an expanding haematoma and the elevation of the intracranial pressure (ICP) - that is a haematoma may expand without any significant rise in pressure. Once this early compliance is lost, the pressure will rapidly rise. This severely jeopardises cerebral perfusion (cerebral perfusion pressure is equal to mean arterial blood pressure minus intracranial pressure). As ICP rises, cerebrospinal fluid is driven out of the intracranial compartment - the first stage in compensation. As the ICP continues to rise, brain shifts occur within the cranial cavity. The most important of these brain shifts is uncal transtentorial herniation or 'coning'. This causes:  Impairment of conscious level Development of an ipsilateral fixed dilated pupil (due to third nerve compression) Hemiparesis of the contralateral side (due to compression of the cerebral peduncle), and later Cardiovascular and respiratory abnormalities due to brain stem compression.  The agonal event is often accompanied by a rise in blood pressure and a fall in the pulse rate - Cushing's reflex."
nervous system,313,"A 70-year-old woman presented with an acute, severe occipital headache, unsteadiness of her gait, and vomiting. She had a history of poorly controlled hypertension. On examination there was nystagmus to the left, ataxia of the left limbs, and gait ataxia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cerebellar haemorrhage,Basal ganglia haemorrhage,Pontine haemorrhage,Subdural haemorrhage,Temporal lobe haemorrhage,A,"Cerebellar haemorrhage: The most common symptoms are of severe nausea and vomiting, and ataxia. Headache may be severe. Patients with cerebellar haemorrhage can rapidly become comatose within hours after the onset from herniation, because of its limited space in the posterior fossa. Pontine haemorrhage: There are numerous nuclei located within the pons. Rapidly deteriorating level of consciousness, impaired extraocular movement, and extensive sensorimotor deficits are clinical clues to pontine haemorrhage. Basal ganglia haemorrhage: Contralateral hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, or hemi-inattention. Aphasia, especially non-fluency and impaired comprehension, is frequently seen if haemorrhage occurs in the posterior limb of the left internal capsule."
nervous system,314,A 22-year-old man keeps having persistent and intrusive thoughts that he is a dirty thief. No matter what he tries these thoughts keep coming to him. Any attempt to avoid these thoughts leads to serious anxiety. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Schizophrenia,OCD,PTSD,Mania,Psychotic depression,B,Though here is obsession of thoughts but no compulsion of activity but there is compulsion of thoughts as well which makes the diagnosis as OCD
nervous system,315,A 46 year old woman is referred with dysphagia and dysarthria.  On examination she is hypertonic in all limbs and she has a brisk gag reflex but there is no evidence of sensory change.  Her hands appear wasted.  What is the likely diagnosis?,Motor neurone disease,Adrenoleucodystrophy,Multiple sclerosis,Cervical Disc Prolapse,Space Occupying Lesion,A,"Motor neuron disease is the most likely diagnosis due to the pseudobulbar findings and the hypertonia in all limbs and lack of sensory features.  It is a normally a distal muscle weakness and weakness and atrophy of the small muscles of the hand are very common.  The history is not indicative of MS as this would would involve sensory symptoms, most likely optic neuritis and lesions spaced in time and place."
nervous system,316,A 45-year-old lady presents with history of double vision and facial numbness. Which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,Cerebral cortex,Trigeminal nerve,Oculomotor nerve,Brain stem,Basal ganglia,D,Cerebral cortex will not cause features of cranial nerve lesions. Trigeminal nerve: ophthalmic and maxillary divisions are pure sensory hence it is also not the answer. Oculomotor does not cause facial numbness. These features are not of basal ganglia lesion also. These features only can be explained by cranial nerve involvement in brainstem lesion
nervous system,317,"A 48 year old male who is a heavy smoker presents to his GP as he has noticed his right eyelid is drooping. On examination there is ptosis of the right eye, right pupillary constriction and right sided anhidrosis. There are no other signs and his only other complaint is that of a smoker's cough. Which of the following investigations should initially be performed to establish the diagnosis?",MRI spine,Chest Xray,Lumbar Puncture,CT Head,"CT Chest, Abdomen and Pelvis",B,"This patient presents with a right sided Horner's Syndrome. There are numerous causes including CVA, MS, syringomyelia, lymphadenopathy and tumours. The clue to the most likely underlying cause here is the history of heavy smoking and cough. This makes the most likely cause a Pancoast's tumour (apical lung tumour) and a CXR would be utilised initially to investigate this."
nervous system,318,A complete division of the femoral nerve results in which of the following?,Failure of adduction of the thigh at the hip joint,Failure of the knee extension,Foot drop,Paraesthesia of the lateral aspect of the foot,Sensory loss over the lateral part of the lower leg,B,"The femoral nerve is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus and arises from L2/3/4. The common peroneal nerve (a branch of the sciatic nerve) is relatively unprotected as it winds its way round the lateral aspect of the head of fibula and if stretched or damaged results in foot drop. The lateral aspect of the foot is supplied by the sural nerve, S1/2, as a branch of the common peroneal nerve. The posterior division of the femoral nerve supplies the saphenous nerve (l3/4), supplying sensation to the medial aspect of the calf and branches to the quadriceps femoris and knee joint. The obturator nerve supplies the hip joint."
nervous system,319,A 41 year old complains of low mood and problems sleeping which get a lot worse during the winter months. The rest of the history and examination reveal nothing of note. What is the likely diagnosis?,Bipolar,Normal,Seasonal affective disorder,Dysthymia,Depression,C,"The diagnosis of Seasonal Affective Disorder is controversial. The American Psychiatric Association DSM IV criteria does not recognised it as an individual condition, but as a cluster of symptoms of depression disorders or bipolar syndrome. When classed as a condition, it is described as the onset of low mood, sleeping problems and often weight gain during the winter months. It is thought to be related to falling levels of light as the treatment is often with bright light to mimic natural daylight."
nervous system,320,A 30 year old male is having recurrent  headaches.  He describes these as pain around the eye with the eye watering.  These are very severe and can last for up to 2 hours and can occur several times a day for a couple of weeks before settling.  What is the likely diagnosis?,Cluster headaches,Glaucoma,Trigeminal Neuralgia,Migraine,Giant Cell Arteritis,A,The history is characteristic of cluster headaches.
nervous system,321,Which of the following is caused by temporal lobe lesions?,Apraxia,Astereognosis,Primitive reflexes,Visuospatial neglect,Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia,E,"Lesions of the frontal lobe include difficulties with task sequencing and executive skills. Other symptoms include:  Expressive aphasia (receptive aphasias are due to a temporal lobe lesion) Primitive reflexes Perseveration (repeatedly asking the same question or performing the same task) Anosmia, and Changes in personality.  Lesions of the parietal lobe include:  Apraxias Neglect Astereognosis (unable to recognise an object by feeling it), and Visual field defects (typically homonymous inferior quadrantanopia).  They may also cause alcalculia (inability to perform mental arithmetic). Lesions of the temporal lobe cause:  Visual field defects (typically homonymous superior quadrantanopia) Wernicke's (receptive) aphasia Auditory agnosia, and Memory impairment.  Occipital lobe lesions include:  Cortical blindness (blindness due to damage to the visual cortex and may present as Anton syndrome where there is blindness but the patient is unaware or denies blindness) Homonymous hemianopia, and Visual agnosia (seeing but not perceiving objects - it is different to neglect since in agnosia the objects are seen and followed but cannot be named)."
nervous system,322,A 76-year-old male attends clinic with his wife who states that her husband has become disinterested and withdrawn. Which of the following would favour a diagnosis of dementia rather than depression?,Agitation,Poor short term memory,Reduced libido,Self-reported concern of poor memory,Urinary incontinence,E,"Urinary incontinence would be particularly unusual in association with a depressive episode and would be far more typical of dementia. Almost invariably a patient with dementia will develop incontinence as the disease progresses. This is not due to urinary tract pathology, but more due to impaired mobility, reduced manual dexterity, mental capacity and motivation. All these factors combine to make continence incredibly difficult. The other symptoms may be found in dementia, particularly impaired memory and concern over memory deficits. "
nervous system,323,A 45-year-old woman has been extensively investigated for a lump she believes to be cancer. She doesn’t think doctors take her seriously and demands another referral. What term best describes her condition?,Munchausen syndrome,Munchausen’s by proxy,Hypochondriasis,Malingering,Phobia,C,Worry about having a serious illness. This debilitating condition is the result of an inaccurate perception of the condition of body or mind despite the absence of an actual medical condition
nervous system,324,A 34-year-old housemaid presents with headaches in the back of her head for several days and pain on flexing her neck. What is the most likely cause?,Subdural hemorrhage,Cervical spondylosis,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,Meningitis,Cluster headache,B,Headache in the back of head and pain on flexing neck is early feature of cervical spondylosis which gradually progress to later symptoms like radiculopathies due to root compression in arms and hands
nervous system,325,"A 54 year old male has been referred as there has been a change in his personality over the last few years.  He has been sexually inappropriate, forgetful and unable to plan.  There is nil of note on examination. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Frontal Tumour,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,Frontotemporal dementia,New Variant CJD,Alzheimers disease,C,"The most likely cause is frontotemporal dementia with the inappropriate behaviour and cognitive impairment.  Speech also deteriorates and they can become aphasic.  Frontal tumour can lead to the altered personality but not the cognitive impairment.  Alzheimers does not lead to personality change.   Normal pressure hydrocephalus is characterised by cognitive impairment, ataxia and urinary incontinence.  New variant CJD does not normally present as above and has a much quicker progression."
nervous system,326,Which of the following is an unusual feature of chronic subdural haematoma in an adult?,Bilateral papilloedema,Fluctuating level of consciousness,Hemiparesis,Internuclear ophthalmoplegia,Unequal pupils,D,"Chronic subdural haematoma is classically associated with fluctuating conscious level and cognitive function. Bilateral papilloedema may occur with raised intracranial pressure. Bilateral internuclear ophthalmoplegia is associated with multiple sclerosis, and unilateral lesions of medial longitudinal fasciculus may occur with small brain stem infarcts. Unequal pupils are associated with rapid transtentorial coning in extradural haemorrhage, leading to ipsilateral dilated pupil, followed by bilateral fixed dilated pupils. andquot;[In subdural haematoma] characteristic herniation syndromes may develop as the brain shifts. As the medial temporal lobe, or uncus, herniates past the tentorium, it can compress the ipsilateral posterior cerebral artery, oculomotor nerve, and cerebral peduncle. Clinically, the consequent oculomotor nerve palsy and cerebral peduncle compression are often manifested by an ipsilaterally dilated pupil and a contralateral hemiparesis.andquot;^1 "
nervous system,327,"A 44 year old female presents with a headache. This has been present for a couple of days and has been gradually gettting worse. It is mainly localised behind and around the eye. She states that her right eye is also painful. She is otherwise fit and well although she gives a history of having had 4 miscarriages. On examination there is evidence of chemosis, proptosis and periorbital oedema of the right eye. There is also a lateral gaze palsy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cluster Headache,Cavernous Sinus Thrombosis,Subarachnoid Haemorrhage,Acute Glaucoma,Intracerebral Tumour,B,"The history and clinical findings are highly indicative of cavernous sinus thrombosis. It is most often secondary to infection spreading from the sinuses. However in this woman's case there is a history of recurrent miscarriages which may indicate antiphospholipid syndrome  and coagulation disorders are a risk factor. Head trauma, dehydration, the pill, pregnancy and chronic inflammatory disorders such as Crohn's disease are also risk factors. The earliest signs are often periorbital oedema and VIth nerve palsy. Cluster headaches do not tend to lead to the eye findings."
nervous system,328,"A 72 year old male presents to his GP with severe right sided facial pain affecting  his cheek.  They occur intermittently and he can have several within an hour.  They affect the upper part of the face, are very sudden and last a few seconds or so.  It is aggravated by the cold.  He has no PMH.  On examination there is reduced sensation in the right cheek and forehead and loss of corneal reflex. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Compression of Trigeminal nerve by tumour,Herpetic Trigeminal Neuralgia,Partial Seizure,Toothache,Idiopathic trigeminal neuralgia,A,"This gentleman has trigeminal neuralgia.  It is likely due to a tumour and compression of the nerve is due to the atypical findings of sensory loss on examination and not triggered by certain actions such as speaking, chewing or brushing teeth."
nervous system,329,"A young adult presents to the emergency department after a motorcycle crash. The patient has bruises around the left orbital area. GCS 13, examination notes alcoholic breath.

She is worried about her weight, and she thinks she may be fat. She has been on a diet and lost 7 kgs in the last 2 months on purpose. She is eating less. She used to do a lot of exercise. Now she says she’s feeling down, has some insomnia and feels tired and without energy. She has not showed up at work. She is worried because recently she got a loan to buy a luxury car. She can’t be fired. She complains about her low mood. She thinks this is weird because she used to be extremely productive. She used to work showing an excellent performance at the office. She even received compliments from her boss. Now, she says her boyfriend is angry because her apartment is a chaos. Usually she spends a lot of time cleaning it, even up to 3 AM. She liked it to be perfect, but not it’s a mess. On examination: BMI 23, no other signs. What is the most probably diagnosis?",Anorexia nervosa,Bipolar disease,Binge eating disorder,Hyperthyroidism,Schizophrenia,B,Now she is depressed but before hypomanic which makes the likely diagnosis of bipolar disorder
nervous system,331,Parents of a 6-year-old boy present concerned that their son may be carrying the gene for Huntington's disease. The father was diagnosed with the disease at age 32. The mother has been genetically screened and is not a carrier of the gene. What is the likelihood of their son suffering with Huntington's disease?,0 risk,1 in 2,1 in 4,1 in 8,3 in 4,B,"Huntington's disease (HD), a progressive, degenerative neurological disease, has an autosomal dominant mode of transmission. This means that only one copy of the faulty gene is required in the genotype for the patient to be a sufferer. With the above case, the father is heterozygous which means he himself only has one copy of the gene (two copies of the gene are very unlikely with extremely severe phenotypes probably incompatible with life) and the mother seems to have no copies of the gene. In this case with an autosomal dominant disease, the likelihood of a child developing the disease is 1 in 2 as it is expected that 50% of the offspring of this couple will have a faulty gene. Symptoms of this disease tend to start to develop in early middle age and include an unsteady gait and jerky involuntary movements, accompanied later by behavioural changes and progressive dementia. The defective gene is located on chromosome 4 and the phenomenan of genetic andquot;anticipationandquot; can occur. This is where the offspring of the affected who also have the disease develop symptoms earlier in life than their parents. Genetic screening is now available. The genetics of Huntington's disease"
nervous system,332,"A 32 year old female has a three day history of severe occipital headache and neck pain following a minor injury. She is then brought to A+E following development of pain and numbness on the right side of her face, dysarthria, hoarseness, dysphagia and vertigo. There is left sided loss of pain and temperature sensation and weakness. She is ataxic and there is evidence of nystagmus and a right sided horners syndrome. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Haemorrhagic stroke,Ischaemic stroke,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Cervical disc prolapse,Vertebral artery dissection,E,The neurological symptoms are characteristic of the lateral medullary syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery syndrome. Given the history of minor injury leading to occipital headache and neck pain this makes vertebral artery dissection the most likely diagnosis. Stroke is the most common cause but given the history of neck pain and age of the patient this makes vertebral artery dissection the more likely diagnosis.
nervous system,333,Which of the following is most useful in differentiating progressive supranuclear palsy from Parkinsons disease?,Difficulty looking up and down,Falls,Dementia,Severity of symptoms,Lack of tremor,A,Progressive supranuclear palsy can present similarly to Parkinsons however often an early feature is inability to look up and down progressing to failure of conjugate gaze. This does not occur in parkinsons.
nervous system,334,A supranuclear lesion of the facial nerve results in which of the following?,Corneal ulceration,Hyperacusis,Inability to wrinkle up the forehead,Loss of motor functions of the tongue,Loss of taste sensation in the anterior one third of the tongue,B,"Injuries to the facial nerve can be divided into supranuclear and infranuclear lesions. Supranuclear lesions may result from hemiplegia, usually due to a cerebrovascular accident. In this type of lesion only the muscles below the palpebral fissures are completely paralysed and hence the patient can close the eyelids and wrinkle the forehead. The commonest cause for infranuclear lesions is the Bell's palsy. In this type of lesion, the ipsilateral upper and lower facial muscles are paralysed which causes inability to wrinkle up the forehead. Corneal ulceration does not result as the eyelids can be closed. Ulceration can occur with infranuclear lesions. If the lesion is proximal to the geniculate ganglion, taste is lost in the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. Secretions from the submandibular, sublingual and lacrimal glands are impaired. Hyperacusis is caused due to paralysis of the stapedius. Motor function to the tongue is not affected since it is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve."
nervous system,335,"A 26-year-old man strongly believes that every elderly man he meets is his father. Although they look different, he is sure it is father wearing different disguises. What kind of delusions is this man suffering from?",Delusion of persecution,Erotomania,Delusion of grandeur,Delusion of doubles,Delusion of reference,D,"The Fregoli delusion, or the delusion of doubles, is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person"

nervous system,341,"A 46-year-old lady who suffers from rheumatoid arthritis presents to the Emergency department with carpal dislocation (confirmed radiologically) after she sustained a fall while out shopping. On examination, with her palm facing upwards, she is unable to lift her thumb up towards the ceiling and has loss of sensation over the thumb, index and middle fingers. Which nerve is the most likely to be injured?",Median nerve,Musculocutaneous nerve,Posterior interosseous nerve,Radial nerve,Ulnar nerve,A,"The signs and symptoms are suggestive of a median nerve injury. In adults, the median nerve is commonly injured near the wrist, although it can be injured anywhere along the arm or the forearm. Low lesions may be caused by lacerations in front of the wrist or by carpal dislocation. Median nerve injuries at the wrist cause sensory loss over the thumb, index, middle, and occasionally ring finger (lateral half). Motor loss includes all thenar muscles (except adductor pollicis) and the lateral two lumbricals. If the injury is at the level of the elbow, there is paralysis of the pronators of the forearm and flexors of the wrist and fingers, with the exception of flexor carpi ulnaris and the medial part of flexor digitorum profundus."
nervous system,342,"A patient presents with gradual onset of headache, neck stiffness, photophobia and fluctuating LOC (loss of consciousness). CSF shows lymphocytosis but no organism on gram stain. CT brain is normal. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Hairy leukoplakia,TB,CMV infection,Candida infection,Cryptococcal infection,B,Fungal meningitis can also present like this but it is much more rare. Moreover negative gram stain excludes fungal cause here. Hence TB meningitis is the answer
nervous system,343,A 26-year-old male presents with speech difficulties. Examinations: nystagmus. Which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?,Midbrain,Pons,Cerebellum,Cerebrum,Vestibule cochlear nerve,C,Difficulty speech (cerebellar dysarthria) and nystagmus are suggestive of cerebellar lesion
nervous system,344,A 38-year-old woman is in the emergency department following an over dose of her medicines. She doesn’t want medical treatment for the over dose. She says she wishes to be discharged. What is the single most appropriate management?,Community psychiatric nurse visit,Psychiatric OPD review the next day,Prescribe anti-depressants,Admission under the mental health act,Discharge and allow to go home,D,There is every chance of repeat over dose. So she should be admitted under mental health act
nervous system,345,A patient with cerebral metastasis has polyuria and polydipsia. Which part of the brain is affected?,Cerebral cortex,Cerebellum,Diencephalon,Pons,Medulla,C,"Diencephalon is the caudal (posterior) part of the forebrain, containing the epithalamus, thalamus, hypothalamus, and ventral thalamus and the third ventricle. Hypothalamus produce ADH and hens lesion of diencephalon (hypothalsamus) may produce cranial diabetes insipidus"
nervous system,346,"A 35 year old gentleman, previously well, collapses and begins to shake violently. His eyes are closed and his head is shaking from side to side. When a witness checks on him, his arms begin to flail more violently. He then gradually stops shaking. His eyes open and he is unaware of what happens but has not sustained any injury and has not been incontinent. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Stroke,Psychogenic non-epileptic seizure,Epileptic seizure,Vasovagal episode,Cataplexy,B,"The history is suggestive of a psychogenic non-epileptic seizure. Shaking the head from side to side, closing eyes and changing severity make an epileptic seizure less likely. Sustaining no injury, biting the tip of the tongue rather than the side of the tongue and lack of incontinence are also useful in distinguishing between the two. Ultimately though video EEG and prolactin levels may be required."
nervous system,347,"A 65-year-old gentleman presents with a two month history of memory impairment. His wife has noticed that he often needs prompting for daily tasks and can be quite drowsy on some days. His memory fluctuates but is not necessarily better in the morning or evening. He has also started to act bizarrely, talking to himself and reaching out for things that do not appear to be there. On examination he has cog-wheeling with a mask-like face and shuffling gait. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alzheimer's disease,Lewy body dementia,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,Parkinson's disease,Wilson's disease,B,"Lewy body dementia is a form of dementia that is closely associated with Parkinson's disease, and is characterised by clumps of alpha-synuclein and ubiquitin protein in neurons (Lewy bodies). It should be distinguished from Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), which is diagnosed when the dementia onset is more than a year after the onset of Parkinson's. Lewy body dementia is diagnosed when the cognitive symptoms begin at the same time or within a year of Parkinsonism. The main features of Lewy body dementia are fluctuating cognition and alertness from hour to hour, visual hallucinations (usually of animal or human, and the patient may have insight into these hallucinations) and motor features of Parkinson's disease. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive condition which causes build up of copper in the body. Copper accumulates in the liver and brain. This results in hepatitis, liver failure or cirrhosis. Accumulation in the brain can result in behavioural changes, depression, seizures, parkinsonism, however the initial sign is usually increased clumsiness. This gentleman has change in cognition and hallucinations as well as being 65-years-old, making Wilson's less likely. Parkinson's disease causes motor signs such as pill-rolling tremor, cog-wheel rigidity, shuffling gait, low voice, reduced arm swing and reduced expression (mask-like), as well as falls due to postural hypotension. Patients can develop memory impairment usually one year after motor symptoms. Normal pressure hydrocephalus presents with urinary incontinence and urgency, gait disturbance (magnetic gait with reduced foot clearance, an increased preponderance to fall backwards and problems particularly with curbs) and dementia (frontal lobe characteristics). Alzheimer's disease is dementia with loss of memory over a period of time, with behavioural changes often aggression, and withdrawal from social/family life. There is reduced attention, with language, problem solving and perception affected (MMSE important test). There are no motor signs."
nervous system,348,"A 22-year-old man suffers a deep laceration to the forearm resulting in transection of the median nerve. Following this injury, the nerve will undergo which of the following pathological processes?",Chronic inflammation,Coagulative necrosis,Fibrinoid necrosis,Segmental demyelination,Wallerian degeneration,E,"Wallerian degeneration is degeneration of the portion of the nerve distal to the injury. It occurs following axonal injury in both the peripheral and central nervous systems and usually begins within 24-36 hours of injury. Coagulative necrosis is cell death following ischaemia or infarction. It is characterised by a 'ghostly' appearance of affected cells unders light microscopy. Fibrinoid necrosis is a form of necrosis in which there is an accumulation of material in the affected tissue with a staining pattern reminiscent of fibrin. It is associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura, malignant hypertension, and hyperacute transplant rejection. Segmental demyelination is a feature seen in axons in the central nervous system with multiple sclerosis."
nervous system,349,A 39-year-old man walks into the Emergency Department after being assaulted with a baseball bat. He had a momentary loss of consciousness but now feels fine. A skull X ray shows a linear right parietal fracture. He suddenly becomes confused and then unconscious with a Glasgow coma scale of 8. His right pupil is dilated. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Diffuse axonal injury,Extradural haematoma,Subaponeurotic haematoma,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Subdural haematoma,B,"Acute extradural haematoma should be suspected after a head injury where the patient has a fluctuating level of consciousness (though not always). The patient may briefly lose consciousness, but soon recovers (lucid interval). They are usually associated with trauma and are seen in the young. Extradural bleeds are commonly due to fractured temporal or parietal bones causing injury to the middle meningeal artery or vein. With increasing bleed (haematoma), lateralising signs develop including an ipsilateral dilated pupil and contralateral hemiparesis. This eventually leads to a bilateral fixed pupil and coma which culminates in respiratory arrest."
nervous system,350,A 32-year-old woman with a history of paranoid thinking and alcohol dependence presents in a psychotic state. Which of the following features in her mental state is most likely to indicate a diagnosis of schizophrenia?,Command hallucinations telling her to kill herself,Hearing two derogatory voices insulting her in the second person,Hearing a male voice threatening to harm her,Hearing a voice talking about her in the third person,"Hearing her dead mother asking her to ""join her""",D,Auditory hallucinations can be present in a range of mental disorders. A diagnosis of schizophrenia is classically indicated by hearing voices in the third person or by voices giving a 'running commentary' on one's actions. The so called 'first rank' symptoms were identified by Schneider as being indicative of a schizophrenic illness. By their nature they are more complex than other auditory hallucinations (such as simple commands) and may indicate a progression of the underlying pathological process. The remaining answer options are are all second person auditory hallucinations and are therefore not suggestive in themselves of a diagnosis of schizophrenia. 
nervous system,351,A 33-year-old man is injured whilst riding a motorbike. He sustains a fracture of his tibial plateau. The orthopaedic registrar decides to provide initial stability by placing a quadrilateral frame (external fixator frame). This consists of two pins being placed and then linked by rods. The first pin is placed in the proximal tibia and the second through the calcaneum in a medial to lateral direction. The site of entry of the calcenal pin is 2.5 cm superior and towards the toes away from the heel. What nerve in this area could be damaged if the pin is incorrectly placed?,Deep peroneal nerve,Lateral plantar nerve,Medial plantar nerve,Superficial peroneal nerve,Sural nerve,C,The medial plantar nerve runs in this area and could be damaged by incorrect pin placement. The deep peroneal nerve orginates between the tibula and peroneous longus before passing inferio-medially towards the ankle joint.  The lateral plantar nerve is a branch of the tibial nerve and passes obliquely towads the lateral aspect of the foot. The superfical peroneal nerve begins at the lateral side of the fibula and innervates peroneous longus and peroneous brevis. The sural nerve runs from the mid calf towards the medial maleous.
nervous system,352,A motorcyclist sustains a traction injury to the upper brachial plexus. This results in which one of the following?,Complete paralysis of pectoralis major,Erb's palsy,Horner's syndrome,Klumpke's palsy,Loss of sensation on the medial aspect of the forearm,B,"The upper brachial plexus roots are C5,6. These contribute to the lateral and posterior cords. A complete paralysis of pectoralis major implies damage to all five segments of the brachial plexus and is a good guide to the extent of plexus injury. Erb's palsy results from injury to the upper roots. The abductors and lateral rotators of the shoulder and the supinators are paralysed so the arm hangs by the side medially, rotated and extended at the elbow (waiters' tip position). Klumpke's palsy results from damage to the lowest roots; the small muscles of the hand are usually affected, resulting in clawing of the hand. The lateral cutaneous nerve is formed by the musculocutaneous nerve as it pierces the deep fascia at the elbow crease."
nervous system,353,A 19-year-old man presents for the 1st time with a firm and unshakable belief that he is being followed by terrorists who are plotting against him. What is the single best term for this man’s condition?,Delusion of persecution,Delusion of grandeur,Delusion of control,Delusion of reference,Delusion of nihilism,A,"Delusions of persecution refer to false beliefs or perceptions in which a person believes that they are being treated with malicious intent, hostility, or harassment – despite significant evidence to suggest otherwise"
nervous system,354,Which of the following is the most useful imaging modality of the brain when investigating Lewy body dementia?,CT,DaTscan™ (dopamine transporter scan),HMPAO PET,MRI,Skull x ray,B,"DaTscan™ (Ioflupane, 123-I FP-CIT) can be used to diagnose Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's disease. Conventional imaging is used mainly to rule out other causes of cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's disease may show as atrophy (medial temporal atrophy is considered most characteristic of Alzheimer's). Vascular dementia may show as scattered ischaemia. Both these changes are more easily detected on MRI than CT. Lewy body dementia (LBD) is poorly served by conventional imaging. DaTscan™ uses radio ligands to bind to dopamine receptors in the brain. The sensitivity of the DaTscan™ for the diagnosis of DLB is 88% and specificity is 100%. Its main drawback is expense. Lewy body dementia has no specific identifying features on CT or MRI. Some studies suggest HMPOA PET can be used to distinguish between LBD and other dementias but it is not as specific as DaTscan. Skull x ray cannot show the soft tissues of the brain and has little value in diagnosing any dementia."
nervous system,355,"A 36-year-old man walks into a bank and demands money claiming he owns the bank. On being denied, he goes to the police station to report this. What kind of delusions is he suffering from?",Delusion of reference,Delusion of control,Delusion of guilt,Delusion of persecution,Delusion of grandeur,E,"A delusion of grandeur is the false belief in one's own superiority, greatness, or intelligence. People experiencing delusions of grandeur do not just have high self-esteem; instead, they believe in their own greatness and importance even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary"
nervous system,356,"A 69-year-old woman presents with a sudden onset of weakness of her right arm and leg. She is known to be hypertensive. There has been no headache, LOC (loss of consciousness), visual, speech or sensory symptoms. Examination: BP 180/90mmHg, pulse 100 and regular heart sounds, no carotid bruit. Higher mental function tests are normal. No apraxia or neglect. Speech, swallowing and sensation are normal. There are no visual field defects. There is a mild facial weakness sparing the forehead. The right arm and leg are flaccid and weak. Reflexes and tone are normal. There is a right extensor plantar response. What is the most likely cause of this pt’s symptoms?",Cardioembolic stroke,Lacunar stroke,Right internal carotid artery atheroembolic stroke,Right internal carotid artery dissection,Right vertebral artery atheroembolic stroke,B,"Weakness of right arm and leg. So lesion is on left side. Hence C,D and E can not be the option. Also no AF or carotid artery disease and features are very much consistent with lacunar infarct"
nervous system,357,A 45-year-old male complains of tremors in hands. Examination: tremors are absent at rest but present when arms are held outstretched and persist on movement. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Parkinsonism,Benign essential tremor,Cerebellar disease,Liver failure,Stroke,B,Tremors absent at rest and present on outstretched hand and persist on movement are benign essential tremor
nervous system,358,"A 58-year-old woman is investigated for new onset epilepsy, accompanied by severe headaches. CT and MRI have shown a space occupying lesion in the frontal lobe that has an enhancing ring around an area of necrosis. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Astrocytoma,Ependymoma,Glioblastoma,Meningioma,Oligodendroglioma,C,"The site of the tumour excludes a menigioma as it is reported to be in the frontal lobe and as such is intrinsic. Ependymomas arise from an ependymal surface usually the fourth ventricle. Glioblastomas are the most common intrinsic brain tumour accounting for between 30-50% of brain tumours in adults, with a peak incidence between 55-65 years of age. The CT and MRI findings are also typical of a glioblastoma. Astrocytomas account for about 10% of primary brain tumours in adults, but are more common in children. Oligodendroglioma account for 3%."
nervous system,359,You see a 45-year-old man in clinic with symptoms of akathisia from his antipsychotic medication. You discuss reducing his antipsychotic but he insists that every time medication is reduced below the current dosage his delusions get much worse. What would be your next best therapeutic manoeuvre?,"Antimuscarinic (for example, procyclidine)","Benzodiazepine (for example, clonazepam)","Beta-blocker (for example, atenolol)","Dopamine agonist (for example, pramipexole)",Vitamin E,B,"This man suffers from akathisia, a well-documented motor side effect of dopamine blockade. Other side effects are dystonia, parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia, but treatment for each differs. Anticholinergics used to treat dystonia might make akathisia worse. According to a Cochrane review (Oct 1999), benzodiazepines (traditionally clonazepam) have the best research evidence in combating this unpleasant side effect. Propranolol can be used, rather than cardio-selective beta blockers, but the Cochrane review found less evidence for its use.  Antimuscarinics are often prescribed, mainly because they are used for other motor side effects of dopamine blockade but again a Cochrane review (Oct 2006) concluded the evidence was poor and there are in fact case reports of antimuscarinics worsening symptoms. There is no firm evidence to support the use of pramipexole and akathisia is listed as a side effect, so it cannot be recommended. Pramipexole is licensed for the treatment of restless legs syndrome, a condition superficially similar to akathisia. Finally vitamin E is often recommended in the treatment of early tardive dyskinesia (although evidence of efficacy is mixed)."
nervous system,360,A 35 year old female presents with a severe throbbing headache. She has a past medical history of migraine. She is confused. On examination there is evidence of a 4/5 power on left side and she is hyperreflexic on the left. She has recently been unwell with sinusitis. A CT is performed and shows no space occupying lesion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Stroke,Migraine,Cerebral Venous thrombosis,Cerebral metastases,Intracranial Abscess,C,"The most likely diagnosis is cerebral venous thrombosis. It often presents as severe throbbing or sharp headache and can be thunder clap in nature. It can lead to reduced conscious level, seizure and focal neurological deficit. The clue in the history is the recent sinusitis which is a risk factor for the development as the infection spreads directly from the sinus. Hypercoaguable states are also a risk factor such as pregnancy. On CT there may be a small area of infarction not in keeping with arterial occlusion. Lumbar puncture may show raised intracranial pressure. A stroke does not typically present with a headache. An intracranial abscess would typically show up on CT. A primary tumour or metastases would also typically have shown up on CT and the history of sinusitis makes cerebral venous thrombosis more likely."
nervous system,361,"A 23 year old female presents to her GP with headaches which she states are worse in the morning and last thing at night and on coughing and posture change. She has also been vomiting. She is reassured and given analgesia.  She then is admitted to A and E following a generalised tonic clonic seizure.  She is found to have 4/5 weakness in right side and upgoing plantars.  A CT head reveals a large multicentric mass with surrounding oedema in the left frontal lobe. There is some midline shift, What is the likely diagnosis?",Glioblastoma,Stroke,Parasitic Cyst,Meningioma,Metastatic Disease,A,The suspicion of a a space occupying lesion show have been raised by the headaches which were highly indicative of a raised intracranial pressure. The most likely diagnosis is a glioblastoma due to the multicentric finding and significant oedema.  These are the most malignant form of astrocytoma.  They have a very poor prognosis.
nervous system,362,"A 67-year-old man after a stroke, presents with left sided ptosis and constricted pupil. He also has loss of pain and temp on the right side of his body and left side of his face. Which part of the brain is most likely affected?",Frontal cortex,Cerebellum,Pons,Medulla,Parietal cortex,D,"The name of the condition is “Lateral medullary syndrome”. Lateral medullary syndrome is a neurological disorder causing a range of symptoms due to ischemia in the lateral part of the medulla oblongata in the brainstem. The ischemia is a result of a blockage most commonly in the vertebral artery or the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. This syndrome is characterized by sensory deficits that affect the trunk and extremities contralaterally and sensory deficits of the face and cranial nerves ipsilaterally. Specifically a loss of pain and temperature sensation if the lateral spinothalamic tract is involved. The cross body finding is the chief symptom from which a diagnosis can be made (in short ipsilateral Horner syndrome and contralateral loss of pain and temperature sense). The patient may have ataxia (cerebellar involvement), dysphagia (nucleus ambigus that involve vagus and glossopharyngeal nerve dysfunction) and slurred speech. Vestibular nuclei dysfunction may cause vomiting, vertigo and nystagmus"
nervous system,363,A nurse comes to you saying that she has recently developed the habit of washing her hands after every 15-20 minutes. She is unable to concentrate on her work and takes longer than before to finish tasks as she must constantly wash her hands. What is the most appropriate management?,CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy),SSRI (selective serotonin receptor inhibitors),ECT (electroconvulsive therapy),Antipsychotics,Desensitization,A,The likely diagnosis is obsessive compulsive disorder. Most effective treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder is cognitive behavioral therapy
nervous system,364,A 30-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a severe headache. A CT brain confirms a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Which one of the following is correct with regard to a recent subarachnoid haemorrhage?,A berry aneurysm is found on angiography more frequently on the vertebrobasilar than on the carotid system,Lumbar puncture should be avoided because of the danger of coning,Severe hypertension should be treated with antihypertensive drugs,The administration of opiate drugs is contraindicated,The risk of recurrent haemorrhage is maximal at day 7,C,"The first line investigation is a non-contrast CT head scan. If negative the next investigation is a CT cerebral angiogram or lumbar puncture. The lumbar puncture should be delayed for 12 hours or more from onset of symptoms as bilirubin is not detected in CSF before this time. Eighty-five percent of berry aneurysms are found on anterior half of circle of Willis. Unless there is clear evidence of raised ICP, the risk of coning with LP is small. An element of hypertension is preferable as it increases the cerebral perfusion pressure against raised ICP. However, if the MAP is over 130 mm Hg, treatment to lower blood pressure should be instituted. The administration of opiate drugs should be considered carefully because they are vasodilators and may reduce the level of consciousness. Codeine plus paracetamol may be used initially for pain (nhs choices). A fentanyl infusion may be considered because of its short duration of action (30-60 minutes) (medscape). This would have to be on a HDU/ITU."
nervous system,365,"A 34 year old female presents with a week long history of nausea, headache and muscle spasms. A full history reveals depression treated with fluoxetine and examination is unremarkable. What physiological imbalance could be the cause?",Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypomagnesaemia,Hyponatraemia,E,"Hyponatraemia is a well documented side effect of fluoxetine, and other antidepressants, and can cause a variety of symptoms that worsen in line with the degree of depletion including nausea, vomiting, headache, confusion, fatigue, appetite loss, restlessness, weakness, spasms, seizures, and coma."
nervous system,366,A 37-year-old woman believes that her neighbours have been using her shower while she is away from home. Her 42 year old partner is convinced about this and calls the police.

Onset is acute, unilateral distribution favours herpes zoster"
nervous system,368,"Infarction of what area of the brainstem would lead to preserved horizontal eye movements, dolls eye reflexes, impaired convergence and upward and downward gaze and sluggish dilated pupils?",Ventral midbrain,Ventral pons,Dorsal midbrain,Lateral medulla,Dorsal pons,C,Failure of upward and downward gaze is due to a dorsal midbrain lesion.  The other findings are also indicative.
nervous system,369,A 24-year-old woman has severe depression 3 months after the birth of her first child. She is breastfeeding but is otherwise unable to look after the baby and is convinced that her family is likely to kill her. She has no interest in anything and keeps crying. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Fluoxetine,Citalopram,CBT,ECT,Haloperidol,E,Diagnosis is given in question as severe depression and as features of psychosis present the better diagnosis would be psychotic depression. As onset is beyond 4 weeks it is no more post partum psychosis. So the 1st line treatment for psychotic depression is combination of antipsychotic + antidepressant. As the combination is not given as options first choice goes for antipsychotic that is E. Haloperidol
nervous system,370,"An 82-year-old man has woken up with incoherent speech and difficulty in finding the right words. Examination: otherwise normal, good comprehension. Which anatomical site is most likely to be affected?",Broca’s area,Wernicke’s area,Midbrain,Parietal cortex,Pons,A,"A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit halting and effortful speech. Speech may only include important content words. Word comprehension is preserved. The person may still be understood, but sentences will not be grammatical. This contrasts with receptive or Wernicke’s aphasia, which is distinguished by a patient's inability to comprehend language or speak with appropriately meaningful words though fluency may be preserved"
nervous system,371,"A 17 year old presents with generalised headache, malaise and confusion.  She is pyrexial and dysphasic although there is no other focal neurology or any other examination findings. A CT brain scan shows hypodensity in both temporal lobes. Which treatment should be initiated early for effective treatment?",Intravenous fluids and IV aciclovir,IV fluids and antibiotics,IV fluids and steroids,"IV fluids, IV aciclovir and anticonvulsants",IV steroids,A,The most likely diagnosis is Herpes Simplex Encephalitis due to the short history and presence of dysphasia.  HSV also leads t the CT findings.  Diagnosis can be confirmed using PCR for HSV in CSF  Steroids can be given if there is significant cerebral swelling and anticonvulsants initiated if there seizures occur.
nervous system,372,"A 24-year-old woman presents with episodes of peri-oral tingling and carpo pedal spasms every time she has to give a public talk. This also happens to her before interviews, exams and after arguments. What is the best management strategy for this patient?",Diazepam,Rebreathe in a paper bag,Desensitization,Buspirone,Propranolol,C,Desensitization is the treatment of choice in long run.

What term describes this continual change of subject?",Delusions of grandeur,Flight of ideas,Clang association,Word salad,Neologism,B,"Flight of ideas is when a patient changes the subject of their speech rapidly, often every few seconds or sentences. It is usually based on associations, distractions or plays on words. It is a symptom of bipolar mania, although is also associated with ADHD and schizophrenia."
nervous system,374,A 38 year old obese woman presents with headache. These are worse in the morning and last thing at night and on coughing. There are relieved on standing. There is evidence of bilateral papilloedema on fundoscopy. A CT head shows no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Hydrocephalus,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Multiple sclerosis,Space occupying lesion,C,"The history and clinical findings are suggestive of raised intracranial pressure. However the CT head is normal and thus benign intracranial hypertension is the most likely diagnosis. A lumbar puncture will also be useful for the diagnosis. It is most common in  obese females in their 30s and 40s. It has been associated with certain medications such as cimetidine, corticosteroids and levothyroxine and certain conditions such as cushings, addisons and thyroid dysfunction. It is thought to be due to impaired absorption and leads to raised intracranial pressure without hydrocephalus or a mass lesion. The other diagnoses can be excluded by the normal CT scan. MS would not account for these symptoms"
nervous system,375,"Which of the following might be a reason for someone to be judged to lack mental capacity using the functional test of capacity (for example, as used by the Mental Capacity Act 2005)?",Contradicting previously expressed wishes,Inability to understand the relevant information,Irrational decision making,Loss of hearing aid,Presence of mental illness,B,"The Mental Capacity Act 2005 uses a functional test of capacity. In the case of the MCA, the specific tests applied are that the individual must show an ability to  Understand and retain the relevant information Weigh their options (and see the consequences of any choice) Communicate their choice.  Although the Mental Capacity Act is specific to England and Wales, the functional test of capacity is used internationally and forms the basis for legislation in Scotland, USA and most English-speaking nations.  Whilst previously expressed wishes should be taken into account, these usually form part of a 'best interests' assessment, which occurs after capacity has been evaluated. The issue of previously expressed wishes would not be a determinant under functional tests of capacity, and mentally capacitated individuals have a right to contradict previously expressed wishes. Using widely accepted criteria for the functional test of capacity, the answer is inability to understand the relevant information. Irrational decision making is called the 'rational outcome' approach - it is not a functional test of capacity and is not used, for example, in the Mental Capacity Act as it is too subjective. Although 'communicating choice' is a criterion in the MCA, loss of a hearing aid would not be considered a sufficiently good reason to judge lack of capacity. The onus is on the doctor to alleviate any remediable communication problem prior to assessing capacity. Many functional tests of capacity have a 'diagnostic hurdle', that is, the presence of mental illness might be a reason to trigger a mental capacity assessment, but mental illness itself is no reason automatically to assume lack of capacity - this would be a 'status' test of capacity."
nervous system,376,"What treatment should be administered for an aggressive, potentially psychotic patient with no history of mental illness?",Diazepam,Quetiapine,Clozapine,Haloperidol,Lorazepam,E,Antipsychotics should not be used as a first line treatment to sedate dangerous patients if there is no history of mental illness as the side effects can be severe. After sedation a cause of the psychosis should be sought.

The anatomical snuffbox is usually involved. Median nerve injury results in loss of sensation over the thumb, index, middle and the lateral half of the ring finger. However, the only autonomous areas of sensory loss are the pulp pads of the index and middle fingers. The hand is held with the index finger held straight, and the other fingers flexed. Ulnar nerve injury results in a claw hand deformity, and loss of sensation over the medial half of the ring finger and little finger."
nervous system,381,A 30-year-old woman has been feeling low and having difficulty in concentrating since her mother passed away 2 months ago. She feels lethargic and tends to have breathlessness and tremors from time to time. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Adjustment disorder,PTSD,Panic disorder,GAD,Bereavement,A,When 2 months passed it is no more normal bereavement but major depression or adjustment disorder
nervous system,382,A 28 year old is wishing to conceive.  She has epilepsy and has been seizure free for one year with phenytoin and lamotrigine.  What do you advise in regards to becoming pregnant?,Commence high dose folic acid now and try to withdraw one of her anti epileptic drugs,Commence high dose folic acid now,Commence high dose folic acid when pregnant,Stop one of her anti epileptics immediately,Commence a multivitamin tablet and reduce dose of anti epileptics,A,The patient should commence high dose folic acid and try to withdraw an anti epileptic due to their teratogenicity.  This should be based on a risk benefit assessment such as type of seizure and frequency and risk of further seizures.  Monotherapy at the lowest dose is optimal for pregnancy.  This patient has partial seizures and thus harm to the mother with these is low however continuing anti epileptics has a higher feotal risk.  Sodium valproate should be avoided due to its high rates of foetal malformations.
nervous system,383,"A 49-year-old man first presented with increasing difficulty in swallowing. Several months later he developed weakness in his right foot. Now he can no longer feed himself, he chokes on food and has become confined to a wheelchair. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral tumor,Myasthenia gravis,Lambert-Eaton syndrome,Motor neuron disease,Cerebro-vascular disease,D,"The picture is of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with bulbar onset, so it has very bad prognosis"
nervous system,384,"A 21-year-old woman has had several sudden onset episodes of palpitations, sweating, nausea and overwhelming fear. On one occasion she was woken from sleep and feared she was going insane. There is no previous psychiatric disorder. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Pheochromocytoma,Panic disorder,GAD,Phobia,Acute stress disorder,B,here closest d/d to panic disorder is pheochromocytoma. But in pheochromocytoma the most important feature is resistant hypertension and other important features are headache and abdominal pain which all are absent here. Moreover overwhelming fear is more suggestive of panic disorder. Hence here the diagnosis is B. Panic disorder
nervous system,385,A man is very depressed and miserable after his wife’s death. He sees no point in living now that his wife is not around and apologises for his existence. He refuses any help offered. His son has brought him to the emergency department. The son can’t deal with the father any more. What is the most appropriate next step?,Voluntary admission to psychiatry ward,Compulsory admission under MHA (mental health act),Refer to social services,Alternate housing,ECT (electro convulsive therapy),B,This patient is refusing any help offered! And his son cannot deal with him anymore! In this situation voluntary admission to psychiatry ward is not possible and the option of choice is “compulsory admission under MHA”. The point here is the man has felt himself in danger by self neglect
nervous system,386,"A lady is referred by her GP with visual hallucinations, periods of both mania and depression and a belief that her child is the messiah. She had given birth 5 days previously. What is the diagnosis?",Postpartum psychosis,Bipolar disorder,Postnatal depression,Baby blues,Adjustment disorder,A,"Postpartum psychosis describes the onset of psychotic symptoms following birth. It is most common in first time mothers and those with a history of psychiatric illness. Symptoms includes mania, overactivity, flight of ideas, disinhibition, delusions which are often grandiose, visual hallucinations, and swinging between hypomania and mania. Baby blues is a mild moodiness that effects over 75% of mothers, tends to last a few days and symptoms include tearfulness, irritability, insomnia, feelings of isolation and hypochondriasis. Postnatal depression can occur up to a year post partum and symptoms include low mood, low self esteem, guilt, exhaustion, anhedonia, social withdrawal, sleep disturbance, low sex drive, weight gain and many others. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale can be used to evaluate for signs of postnatal depression."
nervous system,387,"A 70 year old female presents with indigestion.  On further questioning she has paraesthesia in her feet and has noticed she has been falling increasingly frequently. On examination she has 4/5 power in her legs, predominantly in the flexors, hyperreflexic knee reflexes and absent ankle reflexes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Spinal cord compression secondary to metastases,Stroke,Guillain Barre Syndrome,Subacute combined degeneration of the cord,Cauda Equina Syndrome,D,The diagnosis is subacute degeneration of the cord due to the clinical findings.  The indigestion would indicate gastritis and therefore damage to parietal cells producing intrinsic factor for B12 absorption.  Spinal cord compression would not have loss of absent ankle jerks and there would be an obvious sensory level.  GBS leads to distal weakness progressing proximally.  Stroke would be unlikely to cause these clinical features.
nervous system,388,"A 16 year old boy is brought to the first seizure clinic. He has episodes, most often in the morning, where he goes stiff, collapses to the ground and jerks for a couple of minutes before resolution and he takes about 15 minutes to recover. He occasionally jerks. There is nil of note on examination. Given the likely diagnosis what drug treatment would you commence?",Sodium valproate,Phenytoin,Carbamazepine,Levetiracetam,Gabapentin,A,The history given is indicative of a diagnosis of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. The first line therapy is Sodium Valproate.

Which nerve is responsible for this pain?,Femoral nerve,Obturator nerve,Iliohypogastric nerve,Ovarian branch of splanchic nerve,Pudendal nerve,B,The Obturator nerve is responsible for the sensory innervation of the skin of the medial aspect of the thigh
nervous system,390,A 50-year-old man presents to the emergency department with acute back pain radiating down to his legs. Pain which is usually relieved by lying down and exacerbated by long walks and prolong sitting. What investigation would be the best option?,MRI,CT spine,XR spine,Dual energy XR abruptiometry,Serum paraprotein electrophoresis,A,"Back pain radiating to leg, pain releaved by lying down and exacerbated by long walk and prolonged sitting are characteristic of lumber (intervertebral) disc disease"
nervous system,391,"A 79-year-old stumbled and sustained a minor head injury 2 weeks ago. He has become increasingly confused, drowsy and unsteady. He has a GCS of 13. He takes warfarin for Atrial fibrillation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Extradural hemorrhage,Cerebellar hemorrhage,Epidural hemorrhage,Subdural hemorrhage,Subarachnoid hemorrhage,D,In elderly head injury usually leads to subdural hematoma even if head injury is minor or trivial and extradural hematoma in elderly is extremely uncommon even in more severe head injury. Warfarin is also a risk factor for subdural hematoma from a minor trauma. Management: 1st line: Evacuation by barr hole craniostomy.2nd line: Craniotomy if the clot is organized. Up to 3 weeks burrhole may be possible but longer than this clot is mostly organized and Flap craniotomy is usually required
nervous system,392,A 27-year-old woman is suffering with headaches that have occurred daily for the past three months. They occur at different times of the day and affect the frontal and occipital areas. She has no neck stiffness or rash. She does not have any visual symptoms. She has noticed cramps and tingling in her lips and fingers associated with palpitations and a feeling of suffocation. She takes no medication. She is concerned because her father died from glioblastoma 12 months ago. What is the likely cause of her headaches?,Anxiety neurosis,Glioblastoma,Idiopathic intracranial hypertension,Nelson's syndrome,Neurosarcoidosis,A,"This lady's symptoms fit with an anxiety neurosis. She has symptoms of anxiety, headache, hyperventilation (tetany and tingling) and palpitations, related to the stressor of her father's death. There are no 'red flags' which would warrant further investigations. Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and glioblastoma would give her a tend to produce a headache that worsened with coughing or sneezing and might be associated with visual symptoms. Neurosarcoidosis can present with nerve palsies, deficiencies of the pituitary function or character changes/psychosis, but this presentation would be extremely atypical.  Nelson's syndrome occurs following bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's syndrome in patients who have an adrenocorticotropic hormone secreting pituitary adenoma. Pre-operatively the patients have high cortisol levels, which reduce following adrenalectomy. This causes an increased production of corticotropin-releasing hormone, which can result in unchecked growth of the pituitary adenoma. In turn this causes pressure on surrounding structures and the secondary loss of other pituitary hormones - a combination turned Nelson's syndrome."
nervous system,393,"A 79-year-old male is admitted with acute confusion and is agitated and aggressive to staff. His relatives who accompany him assert that he had been entirely self-caring, does not drink alcohol and was taking no previous medication. He was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and commenced antibiotics but remained agitated and distressed. Which one of the following treatments is the most appropriate for his agitation?",Chlorpromazine,Diazepam,Haloperidol,Temazepam,Trazodone,C,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is acute delirium, caused by the urinary tract infection. There is no suggestion of underlying dementia from the information given to you by the patient's family. The NICE guidelines on delirium were last updated in 2010. They recommend initially using verbal and non-verbal techniques to de-escalate the situation when the patient is distressed. If these are unsuccessful or inappropriate, and the patient is considered to be a risk to themselves or others, then they recommend using short-term (1 week or less) haloperidol or olanzapine, started at the lowest appropriate dose and titrated cautiously.   Delirium risk is thought to be increased with the use of benzodiazepines, so you should avoid new prescriptions of these (and consider reducing if patients are on them long-term). They can exacerbate mental status changes, and cause oversedation.   There has been some suggestion that trazodone, a 5-HT receptor antagonist, might be beneficial in treating delirium but there is a lack of randomised evidence and it is not recommended by NICE.  "
nervous system,394,"A 34-year-old-male presents with history of headache presents with ataxia, nystagmus and vertigo. Where is the site of the lesion?",Auditory canal,8th CN,Cerebellum,Cerebral hemisphere,Brain stem,C,Features described are consistent with cerebellar lesion

He has no history of alcohol or substance misuse. Which of the following is likely to be the best description of his hallucinations?,External voice with the quality of a real perception,Hearing crying when in the shower,Hearing a voice on falling over to sleep,Hearing a voice while waking up from sleep,"Voice located in internal space saying ""you are patheticandquot;",A,"Auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia are typically experienced as being located in external space and being similar in quality to a real voice. They are more likely to be associated with impaired insight and with a reduced sense of voluntary control. Studies have identified multiple factors in their genesis, including biological, cognitive and contextual factors. Voices heard when either falling asleep or waking up are not usually of diagnostic significance. It is a fairly common experience to 'hear things' when background noise (such as that of running water) is present. Hearing a voice located in internal space saying andquot;you are patheticandquot; is more likely to be a pseudohallucination (i.e. one recognised as a hallucination) as it is located internally (in the mind). "
nervous system,399,A child has just recovered from meningitis. What investigation will you do before discharge?,CT scan,EEG,Blood culture,Repeat LP,Hearing test,E,"deafness is a common complication of meningitis, so hearing test is suggested before discharge"

nervous system,401,A 74-year-old female presents with headache and neck stiffness to the emergency department. Following a LP the patient was started on IV ceftriaxone. CSF culture revealed listeria monocytogenes. What is the appropriate treatment?,Add IV amoxicillin,Change to IV amoxicillin + gentamicin,Add IV ciprofloxacin,Add IV co-amoxiclav,Continue IV ceftriaxone as mono-therapy,B,From the given option B is the most acceptable. However Ampicillin + gentamycin is the drug combination of choice
nervous system,402,A 45 year old patient who is known to drink excessively presents in acute alcohol withdrawal. On examination he appears malnourished. He is commenced on diazepam. His BM is 4.2mmol/l. What is the next course of action?,IV dextrose,Liason psychiatry,Commence IV Thiamine,IV magnesium,IM glucagon,C,In patient who suffers from alcohol dependency there is a high risk of thiamine deficiency which can lead to Wernicke's Encephalopathy.  In any patient with alcohol withdrawal IV thiamine should be commenced. There is a theoretical risk of precipitating Wernicke's encephalopathy in patients with alcohol dependency if they are given IV dextrose before thiamine as oxidation of glucose utilises thiamine and it is therefore advised to give glucose concurrently or after thiamine. Patients with alcohol dependency are at risk of hypoglycaemia and thus BM and formal glucose should be measured. Similarly they are at risk of hypomagnesaemia and this should be measured. Both hypoglycaemia and hypomagnesaemia should be treated if required however in this case IV thiamine can be commenced and bloods awaited. A BM should be performed before commencing treatment.
nervous system,403,A 52-year-old woman speaks rapidly without any pause and ignores interruptions. She doesn’t even pause to take enough breaths. What term best describes this kind of speech?,Flight of ideas,Broca’s aphasia,Wernicke’s aphasia,Pressure of speech,Verbal dysphasia,D,"Pressure of speech is a tendency to speak rapidly and frenziedly, as if motivated by an urgency not apparent to the listener. The speech produced is difficult to interrupt. Such speech may be too fast, erratic, irrelevant, or too tangential for the listener to understand. Commonly seen in hypomania, mania, schizophrenia, extreme anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder"
nervous system,404,Parkinsonism may result from which of the following?,Amitriptyline therapy,Cabergoline therapy,Carbon dioxide retention,Mercury poisoning,Wilson's disease,E,"Parkinsonism is a typical side effect of most anti-psychotic agents, but the effects are reduced with the newer anti-psychotics such as olanzapine (not with the tricyclic antidepressant [TCA] amitriptyline). However, extrapyramidal effects are seen with Wilson's disease, carbon monoxide poisoning, and with methoxy trifluoromethyl phenyl acetic acid (MTPA) abuse. Cabergoline, a dopamine agonist, is a treatment for Parkinson's disease."
nervous system,405,Which of the following is consistent with brainstem death?,Absence of pupillary light reflexes with fixed pupils,Absent tendon reflexes in upper and lower limbs,Cheyne-Stokes breathing,Periodic breathing,Presence of cold caloric reflex,A,Brain stem death is characterised by:  Apnoea Fixed pupils that do not respond to light No response to cold caloric testing.  Spinal reflexes may be preserved in brainstem death. 
nervous system,406,Which of the following is more suggestive of vascular dementia than other dementias?,Early loss of insight,Sleep wake cycle disturbance,Slow onset,Increased creativity,Seizures,E,"Vascular dementia is progressive neurological decline secondary to cerebral vessel disease. It is acute in onset and follows either strokes, TIAs or silent strokes. It is most common in hypertensive patients. Its characterising symptoms include suddent onset, stepwise progression,  patchy cognitive impairment as some areas will be intact and localised neurological signs. Insight into memory problems is retained until later in the disease unlike Alzheimers in which it is lost early."
nervous system,407,A 26-year-old female is admitted for a day case procedure. You suspect that she may be nervous about the procedure. Which feature would suggest an anxiety neurosis?,Amnesia,Delusions,Hypotension,Supraventricular tachycardia on ECG,Tetany,E,"Features of anxiety attacks include:  Sinus tachycardia Palpitations (White-coat) hypertension, and Tetany due to hyperventilation (low ionic calcium associated with respiratory alkalosis).  Sinus tachycardia is simply a fast heart rate with normal conduction rate greater than100/min; it is not considered as a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). An SVT (often of sudden onset and symptomatic) usually has a narrow QRS but includes the broad complex tachycardias with a QRS of greater than120 msSVT. It would not be expected during an episode of an anxiety neurosis. Amnesia and delusions are not features."
nervous system,408,A 65-year-old man after an open cholecystectomy experiences numbness around the umbilicus. Which nerve is damaged?,Diaphragmatic nerve,T4 nerve,Intercostal nerve,L1-L2 nerve root,T10 nerve root,E,Dermatom pattern of T10 nerve: Traverses posteriorly from T10 to anteriorly through the umbilicus

On examination she has no verbal response and she is not opening her eyes to pain. She has a dense right hemiparesis and her right plantar reflex is upgoing. She begins to seize. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Intracranial haemorrhage,Meningitis,Encephalitis,Subdural haematoma,Ischaemic stroke,A,"The preceding headache, sudden onset and severity makes an intracranial haemorrhage more likely than ischaemic stroke. There is no history to suggest meningitis or encephalitis."
nervous system,410,An 81-year-old gentleman with dementia is brought to the Emergency department with a right-sided hemiparesis. His nursing home carer states he might have hit his head against a washing sink about two weeks ago. Since then he has complained of recurrent episodes of headaches and has been noticed to have variation in his conscious level. He is on warfarin for atrial fibrillation. Choose the single most appropriate diagnosis.,Concussion,Diffuse axonal injury,Extradural haematoma,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,Subdural haematoma,E,"This patient is most likely to have a subdural haematoma. They are usually secondary to trauma, sometimes trivial, where the patient (or carer) does not recall the incident. Spontaneous subdural haematomas can occur in elderly patients with cerebral atrophy due to shearing of the subdural veins (venous plexus). Alcoholics, epileptics and patients on anticoagulants are more susceptible. In chronic subdural haematomas, patients may not become symptomatic for many days or even weeks after injury. If the haematoma continues to enlarge, headache, fluctuating level of consciousness, failing intellect and hemiparesis can all present."
nervous system,411,A 23-year-old man attends your surgery complaining of feeling unwell after taking several Ecstasy tablets the night before. Which of the following features would be most consistent with a serotonin syndrome secondary to MDMA?,Autonomic instability,Elevated creatine kinase,Hallucinations,Hyperreflexia,Reduced level of consciousness,D,"MDMA is a serotonin-noradrenalin-dopamine releasing agent and reuptake inhibitor. It can cause a significant rise in serotonin levels and the consequent rapid development of a serotonin (or serotonergic) syndrome with diverse symptoms including:  agitation hyperreflexia hyperthermia, and increased pulse and blood pressure.  Autonomic instability and elevated creatine kinase are more likely to be seen in neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Hallucinations are more typical of drug intoxication than a serotonergic syndrome. Agitation rather than sedation is typical of serotonin syndrome. "

Which of the following is most likely?",Early onset dementia,Alcohol excess,Picks disease,Depression,Anxiety disorder,D,"Depression is most likely due to the anhedonia, low mood, sleep disturbance and decreased care of her appearance. Normal blood results rule out B12/folate deficiency and hypothyroidism. Dementia would be unlikely and, without any major personality changes or disordered speech and though, Picks is also not likely."
nervous system,415,"A 28 year old who is 7 months pregnant presents with pain and tingling in her left hand which she notices is worst in the morning.  She has also noticed dropping things.  On examination there is 4/5 power in the left abductor pollicis brevis and of thumb flexion.  There is reduced sensation in the left thumb, index, middle and half of the lateral half of the ring finger.  There is nil else of note.  What is the most likely structure affected?",Radial Nerve,Axillary Nerve,Ulnar nerve,C7 nerve root,Median Nerve,E,"The diagnosis is carpal tunnel syndrome where the median nerve is compressed at the carpal tunnel.  There are many risk factors including, diabetes, pregnancy, hypothyroidism, Rheumatoid arthritis,  obesity , previous fractures and amyloidosis.  The other structures would not lead to these clinical findings."
nervous system,416,"An 80-year-old man was recovering from diarrhoea when he developed difficulty in swallowing and had a choking fit while eating a sandwich. He took to his bed, complained of back pain, bilateral leg pain, numbness in the feet and could not stand up. He smoked 20 cigarettes a day and drank 20 units of alcohol each week.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Brain stem infarction,Miller-Fisher syndrome,Motor neurone disease,Myasthenia gravis,Transverse myelitis,B,"Miller-Fisher syndrome is a variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome, thought to be an acute post-infective neuropathy, often follows one to three weeks after an infection. It comprises ophthalmoplegia, ataxia and areflexia. Campylobacter jejuni is a well-recognised cause of severe Guillain-Barre and Miller-Fisher syndrome.  A brain stem infarct producing bilatateral signs is usually not compatible with life. Motor neurone disease has a more insidious presentation and does not often affect the eye muscles.  Myasthenia gravis may present like this, but it would be unusual in someone of this age group. Despite muscular weakness, deep tendon reflexes are often preserved. Transverse myelitis is inflammation of the spinal cord and one would not expect involvement of the cranial nerves."

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Glaucoma,Pressure Headache,Tension Headache,Cluster headache,Migraine,D,"The history is indicative of a cluster headache.  There can also be an associated Horners Syndrome on examination.  Glaucoma is unlikely to cause intermittent headache.  Migraine would be expected to have associated visual changes and is not usually located at the eye.  Pressure headaches are worse on coughing, posture change and in the morning.  Cluster headaches do sometimes respond to oxygen therapy and triptans."

Under advice from your consultant, you use a section 5(2) holding power of the Mental Health Act (MHA) 2007 to detain him. Which of the following is permitted in a section 5(2)?",Conversion to section 2 (assessment order) or 3 (treatment order) of the MHA 2007,Detention for 28 days,Leave if agreed with the responsible clinician,Transfer to a psychiatric hospital,Treatment with an antidepressant,A,"The MHA 2007 affects mainly England and Wales but other mental health acts in other countries have similar short term holding orders. A 5(2) is a holding power under the MHA 2007. It is not designed to authorise treatment and its powers are frequently over-estimated. A readable guide to what is and is not allowed is available in the MHA Code of Practice. The purpose of the holding power is simply to keep an in-patient in hospital for the purpose of formal assessment, therefore formal assessment to a section 2 or 3 is not just permissible, it is strongly encouraged. As a holding order, the power of a 5(2) is limited - it does not allow any treatment, physical or psychiatric, that needs to be done under the Mental Capacity Act if the patient does not consent. An individual cannot be given leave or transferred either, unless there is a medical emergency. A 5(2) lasts a maximum of 72 hours (section 2 is for 28 days), but it would be considered bad practice for it to get to the maximum time limit without a formal assessment. "

Prophylactic treatment should be considered in those with disabling headaches at least twice per month, acute treatment being used more than twice per week and when migraines are associated with neurological symptoms and signs. First line therapies is usually a beta blocker such as propanolol although TCAs and calcium channel blockers can be utilised.  In this case a beta blocker is not useful due to her asthma. Anti epileptic drugs are useful second line with valproate utilised and gabapentin and topiramate.  Methysergide and venlafaxine are also useful."
nervous system,427,"Regarding Erb's palsy, which of the following statements is correct?",Affects the small muscles of the hand,It exclusively occurs after 'head-first' delivery,Is the commonest form of birth trauma,May be due to injury of the lower brachial plexus,May lead to wasting of the arm,E,"Minor soft tissue injuries to the head, for example following scalp electrode placement or caput succedaneum, occur more commonly. Erb's palsy involves injury to the upper brachial plexus (C5-6), and leads to wasting of arm, but not the intrinsic muscles of the hand, which would be the result of lower brachial plexus injury. Erb's palsy is more common in large-for-dates infants and breech deliveries. The most common cause of Erb's palsy is dystocia, an abnormal or difficult childbirth or labour. It can occur if the infant's head and neck are pulled toward the side while the shoulders pass through the birth canal. The condition may also be caused by excessive pulling on the shoulders during a head-first delivery, or by pressure on the raised arms during a feet-first delivery. Klumpke described the clinical picture of lower brachial plexus injury (C7-T1)."
nervous system,428,"A 21-year-old history student has returned to university after a field trip to the US. His girlfriend has called the student health service as he has begun dressing in ceremonial robes and has announced to her that he is the dean of the faculty and orders her to wait on his every need. He has been known to use cannabis in the past and has used ecstasy on several other occasions.

Thirty six hours after admission to the psychiatric unit the patient reorts visual hallucinations and has a grand-mal seizure. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the seizure?,Amphetamine withdrawal,Hypercalcaemia,Idiopathic epilepsy,LSD withdrawal,Withdrawal from alcohol,E,"LSD withdrawal is not reported to cause seizures, and amphetamine withdrawal is associated with depression, intense hunger and lethargy, but not with seizures. There is nothing to suggest hypercalcaemia in this patient as the cause for fits but hyponatraemia associated with water intoxication following ecstasy abuse would be a possibility. Alcohol withdrawal in an habitual abuser is a well recognised cause of fits together with the altered behaviour. It is unlikely, given the circumstances, that this is idiopathic epilepsy, although it remains a differential diagnosis."
nervous system,434,"A 22-year-old man has rushed into the emergency department asking for help. He describes recurrent episodes of fearfulness, palpitations, faintness, hyperventilation, dryness of the mouth with peri-oral tingling and cramping of the hands.

What is this explanation called?",Glasgow head injury rule,Kernohan's syndrome,Monro's law,Monro-Kellie doctrine,Sylvius' law,D,"The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the total volume of the entire cranium must remain constant as the skull is a fixed volume. Therefore, a rapidly expanding haematoma needs urgent evacuation to prevent pressure on other structures. Of the other options only Kernohan's syndrome exists. The Kernohan-Woltman syndrome (1929) is a false localising ipsilateral hemiparesis. It is caused by transtentorial herniation: the free edge of the tentorium then compresses the contralateral crus cerebri."

Which single feature best suggests a high risk of future suicide?,Being responsible for children,Ingestion of alcohol with the overdose drug,Ingestion of more than one drug,Making plans before the overdose to avoid discovery,Religious beliefs,D,"The effort to conceal the overdose suggests a serious intent to complete suicide more so than the other options given. Previous history of overdoses (rather than parasuicide, as we do not know exactly what has been taken - he could have taken an overdose of cod liver oil!) does not necessarily imply a more serious intent. Other factors that would imply a more sinister intent would be male, elderly with mental illness. According to the Assessment of suicide risk clinical guide document, religious beliefs, social support and being responsible for children are protective factors. This latter factor is an important point of focus for your examination question technique. If presented with a suicidal patient in surgery, the fact that they're responsible for children needs to be noted and will be included in your management plan (and involvement of other healthcare professionals). However, don't be distracted by that from the point of view of this question. The question is asking you specifically about features that suggest a high risk of suicide. Being responsible for children is a protective factor, so would not be an appropriate answer to the question being posed here, but that does not mean that it is not an important point from the perspective of your wider management (eg safeguarding), which is not being tested in this question.

What is the single most likely defect?,Homonymous hemianopia,Homonymous upper quadrantanopia,Bitemporal hemianopia,Cortical blindness,Homonymous lower quadrantanopia,C,pituitary tumour by pressing optic chiasma causes bitemporal hemianopia
nervous system,474,A 42-year-old man has been tired and sleepy for the last few weeks in the morning. His work has started getting affected as he feels sleepy in the meetings. His BMI is 36. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Idiopathic hypersomnia,Narcolepsy,Chest hyperventilation syndrome,OSAS (obstructive sleep apnea syndrome),REM-related sleep disorder,D,Day time somnolence and obesity (high BMI of 36) points the diagnosis of OSAS
nervous system,475,Which of the following statements is true of the musculocutaneous nerve?,Contains only sensory fibres,Is a branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus,Leaves the plexus at the point at which it crosses the first rib,Receives fibres from the eighth cervical spinal root,None of the above,B,"The musculocutaneous nerve is the major terminal branch of the lateral cord of the brachial plexus. The lateral cord contains fibres from the superior and middle trunks which represent the spinal roots of the fifth to seventh cervical vertebrae. It leaves the plexus as the cords give off their branches to the major nerves of the arm. The cords correspond to the point at which the plexus emerges from behind the clavicle. It courses the axilla in the coracobrachialis muscle, and then descends obliquely and laterally between the biceps and brachialis muscles, sending motor fibres to all of these. It terminates in the forearm as the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve supplying sensation to the lateral aspect of the forearm."
nervous system,476,A 44-year-old man comes with history of early morning headaches and vomiting. CT brain shows ring enhancing lesions. What is the single most appropriate option?,CMV,Streptococcus,Toxoplasmosis,NHL (non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma),Pneumocystis jerovii,C,"Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease caused by Toxoplasma gondii. This can cause damage to the brain (encephalitis) particularly in immunocompromised people, such as those with HIV/AIDS, those taking certain types of chemotherapy, or those who have recently received an organ transplant"
nervous system,477,A 65 year old male is brought to A+E as he is drowsy. He is confused and eyes are opening to speech. He drinks alcohol excessively. You notice a laceration on his head. A CT head is performed and there is evidence of a right sided crescent shaped extraaxial collection with increased attenuation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Extradural Haemorrhage,Evolving Stroke,Acute Subdural Haematoma,Subarachnoid Haemorrhage,Chronic Subdural Haematoma,C,The history of alcohol excess and head injury should raise suspicion of SDH. The CT head findings are characteristic of SDH. SDH can affect more of the cerebral hemisphere as blood can cross suture lines unlike in extradural haemorrhage. The history and CT findings are in keeping with an acute SDH rather than a chronic SDH which shows isoattenuation.
nervous system,478,A 57-year-old man who had MI a few months ago has been having a low mood. A diagnosis of moderate depression has been established. Which medication is the best treatment for him?,SSRI,TCA,MAOi,Benzodiazepam,Mood stabilizer,A,Among SSRIs Sertraline is the drug of choice in MI patient. If SSRI cannot be used Mirtazapine is recommended as next antidepressant

Her brother was recently diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 26, her father was previously diagnosed at the age of 56, and her grandfather at the age of 69. Which of the following phenomena is exhibited here?",Autosomal dominance,Complete penetrance,DNA methylation,Genetic anticipation,Incomplete penetrance,D,"Genetic anticipation occurs when an inherited disorder presents at a younger age with successive generations. Disorders presenting with anticipation include a range of neurological disorders, such as autosomal dominant Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Autosomal dominance has no bearing on whether the condition presents at a younger age with successive generations, although familial Parkinson's is usually a dominant disorder. DNA methylation does change gene expression but is not thought to be the cause of anticipation seen here. Complete and incomplete penetrance refers to the range of symptoms seen with a particular condition."
nervous system,480,"A 50-year-old woman presents following a fall. She reports pain and weakness in her hands for several months, stiff legs, swallowing difficulties, and has bilateral wasting of the small muscles of her hands. Reflexes in the upper limbs are absent. Tongue fasciculations are present and both legs show increased tone, pyramidal weakness and hyper-reflexia with extensor plantars. Pain and temp sensation are impaired in the upper limbs. What is the most likely diagnosis?",MS (multiple sclerosis),MND (motor neuron disease),Syringobulbia,Syringomyelia,Myasthenia gravis,C,In MS there are characteristic relapse and remission which is absent here; In MND there is no sensory deficit; Syringomyelia doesn’t cause cranial nerve lesion and in myasthenia there is muscular weakness without atrophy. Here the features described well fits with syringobulbia
nervous system,481,"A 32 year old female presents with acute painful reduction of vision in her right eye and double vision. There was a previous investigation of paraesthesia of the leg and transverse myelitis which both self resolved. A lumbar puncture reveals oligoclonal bands and an MRI reveals plaques in the periventricular region, brainstem and cervical cord. There is a delay in visual evoked response. Which treatment can be used to try to reduce relapses long term?",Methylprednisolone,Prednisolone,Plasmapheresis,Nil,Interferon beta,E,"The history is highly indicative of multiple sclerosis. For acute attacks IV methylprednisolone can be utilised to shorten attacks. If there is evidence of a relapsing and remitting course and at least 2 neurological attacks over the last 2 to 3 years and the patient can walk more than 100 metres unaided then interferon beta can be utilised to try to reduce relapses. Glatiramer is an alternative. New agents which are immunosuppressives such as natalizumab which is a monoclonal antibody, mitoxantrone and campath 1H are also being utilised."
nervous system,482,Which of the following statements is correct in the forearm and hand?,Flexor digitorum superficialis flexes the distal interphalangeal joint,"C8, T1 traction produces a claw hand",The deep ulnar nerve supplies all lumbricals,"The radial nerve supplies all sensation to the thumb, index and middle fingers",The ulna articulates with triquetral,B,"The median nerve and deep ulnar nerve C8, T1 roots supply the intrinsic muscles of the hand. Upward traction (classically during a breech delivery) on C8,T1 causes a claw hand (Klumpke's paralysis). Flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) flexes the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. The deep ulnar nerve (C8,T1) supplies the third and fourth lumbricals only. The median nerve (C8, T1) supplies the lateral two lumbricals (1st and 2nd). The interossei are supplied by he deep ulnar nerve (C8,T1). The radial nerve, via its superficial branch, provides sensory innervation to much of the back of the hand, including the proximal thumb, index finger and lateral middle finger, plus the web of skin between the thumb and index finger. However, there is considerable overlap with the cutaneous branches of the median and ulnar nerves. The wrist joint (or radiocarpal joint) is formed between the scaphoid, lunate and triquetral bones and the distal radius. The ulna does not articulate with the triquetral bone."
nervous system,483,Which of the following statements concerning the causation and dynamics of schizophrenia is correct?,Heavy cannabis use does not increase the risk of developing schizophrenia,In monozygotic twins the risk of the second twin developing schizophrenia if the first is affected is of the order of 10%,Schizophrenia is commoner in higher socio-economic groups,Schizophrenia is commoner in individuals not in stable relationships,The lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia if one parent is affected is of the order of 50%,D,"The famous Swedish conscript study suggested a sevenfold increase in schizophrenia risk in heavy cannabis users^1. Schizophrenia occurs twice as often in unmarried and divorced people as in married or widowed individuals. Furthermore, people with schizophrenia are eight times more likely to be in the lowest socioeconomic groups. These statistics are likely to reflect the alienating effects of this disease rather than any causal relationship or risk factor associated with poverty or a single life. Nevertheless, low income and poverty may increase the risk for exposure to biological factors (for example, infections or toxins) or social stressors that could trigger the illness in susceptible people. Monozygotic twins may have a 50% concordance and 10% of offspring may be affected suggesting strong inheritance. "
nervous system,484,A 25-year-old woman has been feeling anxious and nervous for the last few months. She also complains of palpitations and tremors. Her symptoms last for a few minutes and are very hard to control. She tells you that taking alcohol initially helped her relieve her symptoms but now this effect is wearing off and she has her symptoms even after drinking alcohol. What is the diagnosis?,Panic disorder,Depression,OCD,Alcohol addiction,GAD,A,"Panic disorder is an anxiety disorder characterized by reoccurring unexpected panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden periods of intense fear that may include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or a feeling that something terrible is going to happen"
nervous system,485,A 68 year old female with Parkinson's Disease. She is now having episodes of severe dyskinesia which rapidly changes to immobility within minutes. She is currently on co-careldopa. Which of the following is the most appropriate step?,Addition of Ropinirole,Addition of selegiline,Increase dose of Co-careldopa,Reduce dose of Co-careldopa,Addition of Cabergoline,A,"In patients with Parkinson's disease where there is on-off fluctuations then the addition of dopamine agonists has been shown to  improve motor impairment and reduce dose of levodopa. Non ergot derivatives such as pramipexole and ropinirole are utilised as first line over ergot derivatives such as cabergoline and bromocriptine as these require a CXR, ESR and renal function measurement before commencement and regular monitoring."
nervous system,486,"A 65 year old male presents with a shuffling gait, micrographia, feeling stiff and slow movement. He is also having visual hallucinations and has become very forgetful and confused at times. On examination he has cog wheel rigidity in all limbs, a shuffling gait and impaired postural reflexes. His MMSE is 22/30.What is the most likely diagnosis?",Parkinsons Disease,Alzheimers disease,Lewy Body Dementia,Vascular dementia,Multi system atrophy,C,"The history above is indicative of Lewy body dementia with the parkinson features, cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations and fluctuating confusion. In MSA there is predominant autonomic features. In Alzheimers there is no parkinsonism features. In vascular dementia, it is unlikely to present with visual hallucinations. Although Parkinsons disease can lead to dementia this is a later feature."
nervous system,487,A 28-year-old female who delivered 6 weeks ago feels sad and has no interest to feeding the baby. She has been eating poorly and having difficulty sleeping. She feels weak throughout the day and has stopped taking the baby out of the house. She also says that the baby has evil eyes. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Postpartum blues,Postpartum depression,Postpartum psychosis,Schizophrenia,Psychotic depression,C,"Features of depression: feels sad, poor eating, difficulty sleep, feeling weak (ii) delusional ideas: thinks baby has evil eyes and not taking the baby out of the house. These features points to the diagnosis of postpartum psychosis. Postpartum psychosis starts within 2 wks (occasionally later) of delivery and it can take 6 -12 months or more to recover from postpartum psychosis"
nervous system,488,Which of the following is a typical side effect of olanzapine?,Akathisia,Hypoadrenalism,Hypoglycaemia,Macroglossia,Steven-Johnson syndrome,A,"Akathisia (restlessness, or an inability to sit still) is a typical side effect associated with the use of the atypical antipsychotic olanzapine. Others include:  Agranulocytosis Hyperprolactinaemia Hyperglycaemia Depression, and Anxiety."
nervous system,489,"In the axilla, which of the following statements is correct?",A rich anastomosis permits the distal axillary artery to be ligated,Lymph nodes enlargement may be due to an abscess in the epigastric region of the abdominal wall,Section of the long thoracic nerve will affect adduction,T1 supplies sensation to the skin of the lateral wall,The axillary artery lies anterior to pectoralis minor,B,"The intercostobrachial nerve (T2) supplies sensation to the lateral axillary wall. The axillary artery lies high in the axilla, above the axillary vein and behind pectoralis minor. The axillary artery has a rich anastomosis of vessels allowing the second part of the axillary artery to be ligated. If the long thoracic nerve is divided, a winged scapula will result (nerve supply to serratus anterior), but if the thoracodorsal nerve is divided (nerve supply to latissimus dorsi) there will be weakness of shoulder adduction. Due to the extensive flow of lymph from the anterior abdominal wall, there may be enlarged axillary lymph nodes."
nervous system,490,A patient who has suffered from a parietal lobe infarct is having difficulty reading. Which of the following is the most likely explanation?,Neglect,Agnosia,Inferior Homonymous Quadrantanopia,Superior Homonymous Quadrantanopia,Sensory loss,C,"Parietal lobe infarcts can lead to an inferior quadrantanopia, neglect, sensory loss and agnosia. The most likely reason for difficulty reading is the inferior quadrantanopia."
nervous system,491,A 76-year-old male presents with cognitive impairment and is diagnosed with dementia. Which of the following is the most probable cause of the dementia?,Alzheimer’s disease,Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,Lewy body dementia,Pick’s disease,Vascular dementia,A,"Dementia is a clinical state characterised by loss of function in multiple cognitive domains beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. Particularly affected areas may be memory, attention, language, and solving. The most common form of dementia, Alzheimer's disease, accounts for about two thirds of all cases of dementia. The presenting symptom is usually forgetfulness for newly acquired information. As the disease progresses there is disorientation and progressive cognitive decline with personality disruption. Another 20% is due to blood vessel disease (multi-infarct dementia), and approximately 15% is dementia with Lewy bodies. Frontotemporal dementia (Pick's disease) accounts for less than 5% of cases. The remaining cases result from a variety of less common disorders, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, Huntington's disease and AIDS-associated dementia. "
nervous system,492,A 55 year old female presents with double vision.  On examination there is evidence of reduced sensation on the right side of her forehead.   You notice her right eye has a right ptosis and dilated poorly reactive pupil and she can minimally move her eye. Where is the likely site of the lesion?,Right Internal auditory meatus,Left Cavernous Space,Right cerebello pontine angle,Right cavernous sinus,Right retro orbital space,D,"The III, IV, V (ophthalmic division) and VI are affected and thus the cavernous sinus is affected.   The Tolosa Hunt syndrome is a granulomatous inflammatory process involving the anterior cavernous sinus/superior orbital fissure region.  It can be secondary to tumour invasion, aneurysm or thrombosis.  The cerebello pontine would lead to CN VII and VIII dysfunction and you would not expect the eye findings if the internal auditory canal was affected."
nervous system,493,"A 24 year old patient presents to her GP. She is complaining of a severe unilateral headache which has occurred at least twice monthly for the last 6 months. The headache is preceded by flashing lights in her left eye and tingling and numbness in her right hand which then spreads up to her arm and face. She is photophobic with the headache and vomits. She has tried paracetamol, naproxen and aspirin with no relief and she has had to take several days of sickness from work. What is the best management course?",Prophylaxis with sodium valproate and sumatriptan for acute attacks,Prophylaxis with Amitriptyline and sumatriptan for acute attacks,Addition of opioid analgesia,Prophylaxis with propanolol and sumatriptan for acute attacks,CT Head,D,"This history is highly indicative of migraine with aura. NSAIDs and antiemetics are given in the first instance. In this patient there is evidence of a high frequency of migraines with a significant effect on her life as she is having to take time off work and simple analgesics are not working thus prophylaxis is indicated. First line therapy is with beta blockers such as propanolol and amitriptyline if there is insomnia or depression associated. Second line prophylactic agents include sodium valproate, and topiramate. Third line therapy includes pzitofen (used previously as first line but now little evidence to show efficacy), gabapentin, methysergide and SSRIs. Botox has also recently been utilised. For acute attacks triptans should be utilised as simple analgesia is failing. Triptans are selective stimulators of 5 hydroxytryptamine. They should be given in moderate to severe cases. There is a risk of rebound headache in 48 hours."
nervous system,494,A 64-year-old woman has been brought by her son for psychiatric evaluation. She says that she has stopped living with her husband because she is convinced it is someone else posing to be him. What kind of delusions is she suffering from?,Delusion of reference,Delusion of control,Delusion of guilt,Delusion of persecution,Delusion of doubles,E,"The delusion of doubles, is a rare disorder in which a person holds a delusional belief that different people are in fact a single person who changes appearance or is in disguise"
nervous system,495,"A 26-year-old man is assaulted, receiving direct blows to his head. He is brought to his local Emergency department where he is assessed by the emergency doctor. On initial examination, he opens his eyes to speech, reaches up to his head as you put pressure on his supraorbital notch and answers questions with confused conversation. What is his Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score?",9,10,11,12,13,D,"Accurate recording of the patient's GCS is necessary so that any further change can be accurately assessed and information can be easily communicated to other health care professionals. In this case, the patient scores:  3 out of 4 as he opens his eyes to voice 5 out of 6 as he localises to pain 4 out of 5 as his conversation is confused  www.glasgowcomascale.org/"
nervous system,496,"A 72-year-old man presents to the Emergency department. He has an unshakable belief that he has stomach cancer and has taken an overdose of paracetamol tablets after making a decision to end it all. He has been off his food for the past six months, having lost 6 kg. He is finding it difficult to fall asleep and wakes in the early hours of the morning at about 4 am. He sees nothing positive in his current situation and has lost all interest in work. On examination he looks unkempt, has clearly not washed or shaved for many days. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 131 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 7.2 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 203 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 99 μmol/L (60-120)   ESR 5 (less than10)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Carcinoma of the stomach,Depression,Hypomania,Personality disorder,Schizophrenia,B,"This man shows:  depressed mood no interest or pleasure weight loss, and early morning wakening.  This all fits with an episode of major depression, the delusion that he has stomach cancer being consistent with this picture. He has a normal full blood count and an ESR just outside the normal range. This makes actual underlying carcinoma of the stomach unlikely. After initial treatment of his paracetamol overdose, medication for his depression should take into account risk of future overdose. Tricyclic anti-depressants are likely to carry significantly more risk than selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in overdose."
nervous system,497,A 70-year-old woman presented with episodic impairment of consciousness. Which of the following is the most likely cause?,Alzheimer type dementia,Chronic sub-dural haematoma,Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease,Depressive stupor,Normal pressure hydrocephalus,B,"This is quite a grey question. The clinical scenario is very brief with no mention of any neurological signs so a logical deduction must be made. Alzheimer's disease would be expected to have a continuous impairment of consciousness in its advanced stages but could be episodic if there were variation in drugs therapy or concurrent illnesses. Similarly normal pressure hydrocephalus, Creutzfeldt-Jacob and depression would present with dementia (or apparent dementia) but not fluctuant. Of all those listed, chronic subdural haematoma is the one which can be associated with fluctuating level of consciousness. This would make it the most likely answer in this scenario. BMJ Postgraduate Medical Journal: Chronic subdural haematoma in the elderly Alzheimers - MSD Manual"
nervous system,498,A 52 year old male presents with weakness in his arms. He has noticed he has been dropping things and his hands appeared thinned. He has also had some difficulty walking. On examination there is evidence of wasting in his hands and biceps with evidence of fasciculation. His biceps and supinator reflexes are brisk. Sensation is normal. In the lower limbs there is evidence of a spastic gait and his plantars are upgoing. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Cervical myelopathy,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Syringomyelia,Inclusion Body Myositis,Multiple Sclerosis,B,With the findings of both UMN and LMN signs in the upper limbs this makes amyotrophic lateral sclerosis form of motor neurone disease the most likely diagnosis. In Cervical spondylosis you would expect there to be sensory symptoms and not a mixed feature in the upper limbs. In Syringomyelia there is classically a dissociated sensory  presentation.
nervous system,499,"A 38 year old has had sinusitis for 1 week.  She presents to A and E  however as over the last day she has had a severe headache and several episodes of vomiting.  She is pyrexial.  An LP is performed and CSF shows a protein of 1.1, glucose half serum value and lymphocytes are evident.  There is no organisms seen.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Tuberculous meningitis,Viral Meningitis,Migraine,SAH,Partially treated bacterial meningitis,E,"This patient is likely to have a partially treated meningitis as she is likely to have been given an antibiotic for her sinusitis.  Bacterial meningitis normally gives a low glucose and polymorphs and organisms are seen, but being partially treated alters this.  Viral meningitis leads to usually increased lymphocytes, normal glucose.  The history and LP findings are not indicative of SAH and migraine and you would expect a low glucose in TB meningitis."
nervous system,500,A 71 year old lady was attacked 9 months ago. Ever since she describes flash backs and nightmares about the event. She avoids going out unless she has to and feels anxious a lot of the time. What is the likely diagnosis?,Agoraphobia,Generalised anxiety disorder,Acutre stress disorder,Post traumatic stress disorder,Depression,D,"The criteria for post traumatic stress disorder is a tragic event, persistently reliving the experience, avoidance of the cause of the event, problems with sleep, anger or concentration, and these symptoms must last longer than one month. Less than one month is acute stress disorder which is similar in all but duration."
nervous system,501,"A 22 year old patient is brought to A+E. She was complaining of a headache, malaise, fever and nausea and vomiting one day previously and then suddenly dropped her conscious level. She is dysphasic and has a right hemiparesis. She then develops a focal seizure. A CT shows abnormalities in temporal lobes. A lumbar puncture is performed and reveals a slightly high protein, normal glucose and mononuclear cells. Given the most likely diagnosis, which treatment is it most likely to respond to?",IV aciclovir,IV amoxicillin,IV dexamethasone,Oral aciclovir,IV ceftriaxone,A,"The history is highly indicative of encephalitis, most likely herpes simplex encephalitis. The CT findings with temporal lobe abnormalities is characteristic of herpes simplex encephalitis. Lumbar puncture findings are suggestive and a CSF sample for PCR to identify herpes simplex can be used to confirm the diagnosis. IV aciclovir should be commenced immediately. Often however the patient is started on IV antibiotics also in case there is an underlying bacterial cause."
nervous system,502,A 29-year-old professional musician describes experiencing an unusual anxiety state which occurred during a rehearsal for a forthcoming concert. Which of the following features would suggest a depersonalization state?,A feeling that the entire room was spinning,A sense that the other members of the orchestra were not real,Being unable to recognise the people sitting beside her,Feeling that she herself was detached from her body,Thinking that the conductor was singling her out for criticism,D,"Depersonalization is a subjective experience that one is detached from one's own body or that it is in some way no longer real. It is often associated with anxiety rather than other mental disorders. Derealisation is a similar experience in relation to the environment or those around you. In this example a derealisation state would be suggested by a sense that the other members of the orchestra were not real, or being unable to recognise the people sitting beside her. In practice derealisation and depersonalization can co-occur. Thinking that the conductor was singling her out for criticism is indicative of referential (paranoid) thinking. "
nervous system,503,A 45 year old male was brought to A+E. He was found wandering the streets of a city and was unsure of where he was or who he was. He could not recall anything from his past. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Transient Ischaemic Attack,Transient Global amnesia,Fugue state,Malingering,Multiple personality,C,The above history is indicative of Dissociate fugue or fugue state. In fugue state there is complete loss of memory including their identity and patients are unable to recall a long period of their life and the patient is usually found wandering. This can last for months. Sometimes patients take on a new identity. In transient global amnesia there is global loss of recent memory with the patient unable to retain new things and unable to recall recent memories. The patient often repeats themselves and can become agitated.
nervous system,504,"A 65 year old female attends her GP due to ""restless legs"". At night or when she is sitting at rest she has the urge to move her legs which is causing extreme irritation. She is otherwise fit and well. Which of the following is useful for the management?",Cabergoline,Carbamazepine,Gabapentin,Pergolide,Ropinirole,E,"This patient presents with Restless Legs Syndrome. This can be associated with iron deficiency anaemia, renal failure, diabetes, RA and amyloidosis. Treatment with dopamine analogues or dopamine agonists such as ropinirole are very effective in idiopathic restless legs syndrome. However Cabergoline and pergolide have fallen from favour. Gabapentin and carbamazepine are useful second line agents."
nervous system,505,Which of the following features is most strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of somatisation disorder?,Below average intelligence,Male gender,Having a close relative with a physical illness,Many admissions to medical wards as an adult,Symptoms of a bizarre nature,D,"Somatisation means the expression of psychological distress into bodily complaints for which medical help is sought. Somatisation disorder is characterised by multiple, recurrent and changing symptoms for which no physical cause can be found. These typically last for over two years, and can be associated with multiple medical admissions. Patients refuse to accept advice or reassurance that no physical cause can be found. Functional impairment is common due to the nature of the symptoms and resultant behaviour. It affects women much more than men, and is accompanied by a tendency to excessive drug use. Common symptoms include gastrointestinal (belching, pain, vomiting, nausea), skin (burning, itching, tingling) and sexual and menstrual complaints. They are not usually bizarre. There is no recognised link with IQ or a family history of disease. Other forms of persistent somatisation include hypochondriasis, dysmorphophobia and psychogenic pain."

On evaluation she has no other problems. What is she suffering from?,Delusion of persecution,Cotard syndrome,Hypnogogic hallucinations,Lilliputian hallucinations,Schizophrenia,C,Hallucinations during going for sleep is hypnagogic and hallucinations during wake up from sleep is hypnapompic hallucinations
nervous system,508,Which one of the following conditions is nucleotide triplet analysis the most useful diagnostic test?,Adult polycystic kidney disease,Down's syndrome,Huntington's chorea,Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy,Klinefelter's syndrome,C,"Klinefelter's syndrome and Down's syndrome are diagnosed principally by chromosomal analysis/karyotype - XXY in the former and trisomy C21 or translocation in the latter. A trinucleotide CAG repeat expansion in the Huntington gene is diagnostic of Huntington's disease. The majority of cases of HOCM are autosomal dominantly inherited yet defective genes; they are located on a variety of chromosomes. DNA linkage analysis is used to assist in the diagnosis of adult PCKD but the presence of multiple copies continues to complicate the development of reagents for direct genetic testing, at least of the 70% of PKD1 that is replicated elsewhere."
nervous system,509,"A 31 year old man is brought to see you by the police. He is unable to recall his name, address or any personal details. He is not agitated but is confused as to why he cannot recall the information. Recall tests show that he can form new memories. The next morning, he remembers who he is and that his company had just went bankrupt. He is low in mood but has no other problems. What is the diagnosis?",Catatonic state,Vascular dementia,Major depression,Dissociative amnesia,Bipolar affective disorder,D,"Dissociative amnesia is defined as retrograde amnesia in the absence of antegrade amnesia with a psychological cause. It may be global, as in this case, in that the patient cannot remember a lot of their past such as their name or specific in which they forget a particular event or time. It typically starts suddenly, usually in response to a major event such as the loss of a partner, and ends suddenly within a few days."
nervous system,510,A young woman is brought into the Emergency department from a friend's house party having consumed some alcohol and a quantity of tablets. Which of the following features would be most suggestive of an MDMA overdose?,Absence of reflexes,Hypothermia,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,Renal failure,Water intoxication,D,"MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy) can present with a variety of features in overdose including:  DIC hyperpyrexia severe hypertension or hypotension renal failure serotonin syndrome, and cerebral oedema.  Hyponatraemia can occur as a result of the user attempting to avoid dehydration by drinking excessive amounts of water (rather than as a result of the MDMA overdose itself). Similarly, water intoxication is likely to be due to drinking excessively to prevent dehydration, rather than a direct effect of the MDMA. Hyperreflexia is expected, rather than absence of reflexes. Hyperthermia would be typical rather than hypothermia. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is usually due to antipsychotic medication, rather than MDMA. "
nervous system,511,A man complains of loss of sensation in his little and ring finger. Which nerve is most likely to be involved?,Median nerve,Ulnar nerve,Radial nerve,Long thoracic nerve,Axillary nerve,B,"Compression of ulner nerve at the elbow, known as cubital tunnel syndrome, causes numbness in the 5th (pinky) finger, along the half (lengthwise) of the 4th (ring) finger closest to the 5th finger, and the back half of the hand over the 5th finger"

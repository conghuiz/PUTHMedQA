others,1,"A 12-year-old girl has severe atopic dermatitis which has not been well controlled with topical treatments, despite good compliance. Her dermatologist has decided to start her on treatment with oral ciclosporin. Which of the following parameters needs to be regularly monitored while she is on treatment with ciclosporin?",Blood glucose levels,Blood pressure,Bone age,Height,Pubertal staging,B,"Hypertension is commonly associated with ciclosporin treatment. This is thought to be associated with systemic and renal vasoconstriction, and disturbed circadian regulation. Vasodilators such as prostacyclin and nitric oxide are suppressed, whereas vasoconstrictors including endothelin are increased. Glomerular filtration is reduced, and sodium retention increased. Target organ damage has been shown to occur more rapidly due to these changes, including intracranial haemorrhages, left ventricular hypertrophy, and microangiopathic haemolysis. In order to avoid such target organ damage, blood pressure must be closely monitored so that treatment can be rapidly initiated. Effective therapy requires the use of vasodilating agents. Whilst ciclosporin can mildly impair glucose tolerance, this is much less common than the hypertension seen with treatment. Bone age, height and pubertal staging are not commonly affected by ciclosporin therapy. "
others,2,"A 13-year-old girl is brought to the Emergency Department after being run over. The paramedics report a 'bullseye' mark on the car windscreen where she has hit it as she has been thrown in the air. On arrival in Emergency Department, she opens her eyes as you put pressure on her fingernail, and withdraws from pain. She does not answer questions, but only makes incomprehensible sounds. What is her Glasgow coma scale (GCS) score?",5,6,7,8,9,D,"The patient is likely to have sustained a severe head injury. A GCS score of 8 or less is generally taken as the definition of coma or severe brain injury. In her case, she scores 8 out 15:  2 for eye opening to pain 4 for withdrawing from pain, and 2 for incomprehensible sounds.  When recording the GCS score, the individual marks for each of the three components should always be recorded rather than one individual score."
others,3,"A 14 year old girl presents with moderate acne and pustules affecting the face, back and chest. How would you manage this case?",Roaccutane,Topical tretinoin,Dianette,Topical erythromycin,Oral tetracycline for three months,E,"Due to the fact this patient has features of moderate acne then oral tetracycline for three months is the most appropriate treatment.  Erythromycin is an alternative.  This is a second line treatment and mild acne is normally treated with topical agents such as topical antibiotics, keratolytics or topical retinoids. Dianette is another option but is also used as a contraceptive and has other implications.  Roaccutane is an oral retinoid and is a third line therapy only prescribed by dermatologists and with certain inclusion criteria due to the teratogenicity."
others,4,"A 14-year-old girl has developed an itchy, scaly patch on her scalp. She had a similar patch that cleared spontaneously 2 years ago. Her aunt has a similar undiagnosed rash on the extensor aspects of her elbows and knees. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Eczema,Fungal infection,Impetigo,Lichen planus,Psoriasis,E,"itchy, scaly patch on scalp are suggestive of scalp psoriasis. Her aunts presentations (similar rash on extensor aspects of her elbow and knees) are also suggestive of psoriasis. It is thought to be an immunological disease"
others,5,"A 14-year-old girl was at a friend's party when suddenly she collapsed on the floor. Others standing beside her said that she complained of a lump in the throat while eating and within seconds, she collapsed. Paramedics arriving at the scene found her to be cyanosed with O^2 saturation of 69%. There were a few lumps around her mouth and throat. Her blood pressure was 90/60 mm of Hg. What managment will reverese the underlying patholophysiological process occuring?",Epinephrine injection,IV hydrocortisone,Oxygen high-flow,Securing the airways,Starting a volume infusion,A,"This girl has suffered an anaphylactic shock. Epinephrine, either SC or IM, is the mandatory first step. This is a life-saving measure and should not be delayed. This girl has the classical features like urticarial rash around face and suddenness of the onset. Usually, after such an event, the patient should be issued with a medical bracelet and taught to carry an epinephrine pen. Parenteral steroids do not have a role in acute anaphylaxis. But they may be used to prevent recurrence, especially bronchospasm. The girl has hypoxia; oxygen will be required, but the airway is not secure. High-flow oxygen may not enter the lungs if there is laryngeal edema. Securing the airway is an important step, but it will take some time. In this girl, whose oxygen saturation and blood pressure are falling, time is of the essence. Thus, epinephrine must be given first. A volume infusion will be needed. Angioedema of the bowel may cause volume depletion and collapse, but it is not a first step. Also, epinephrine will reduce capillary leakage and reduce the need for volume supplementation."
others,6,"A 15-year-old boy comes to the dermatology clinic as his parents are concerned about some changes they have noticed in his skin. He is from a travelling community, and as such his parents have previously shunned medical services. On examination you notice that he has a number of facial and periungual fibromata. He also has a number of hypomelanotic areas (at least four) on examination of his skin. You also notice gingival fibromata and pitting of his tooth enamel on examination of his mouth. On which chromosome is the abnormality associated with this disease likely to be found?",Chromosome 2,Chromosome 6,Chromosome 9,Chromosome 11,Chromosome 12,C,"This boy has tuberous sclerosis, which is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion, with responsible defects having been identified on both chromosome 9 and chromosome 16. These chromosomes carry codes for hamartin and tuberin, protein gene products which are responsible for regulation of cell growth. Most of the tumours which are produced in tuberous sclerosis are hamartomas, and various phenotypes of the disease occur, with some parents of patients having much more subtle features than those seen in their children. "
others,7,"A 15-year-old boy was treated with permethrin cream for scabies infestation, with the treatment being repeated after seven days as recommended. On follow-up three weeks later, he was found to have continuing infestation. What is the most likely reason for this?",Facial skin was not treated,Non-disposal of underwear,Other household members were not treated,The organism is resistant to permethrin,The treatment was not repeated for a third time as recommended,C,"Scabies is an intensely pruritic and highly contagious infestation of the skin acquired through close personal contact. A delayed type IV hypersensitivity reaction to the mites, their eggs, or excreta occurs approximately 30 days after infestation and is responsible for the intense pruritus that is the hallmark of the disease. Treatment is topical, and often with permethrin. Application should be repeated seven days after initial treatment to kill any mites hatched from eggs in that time, and if done properly, treatment failures are uncommon. Recurrence of the eruption usually means re-infection has occurred, and this is often from close household contacts. All household members and close personal contacts should, therefore, be treated whether or not they are symptomatic and patients should be re-examined two weeks after treatment to evaluate effectiveness."
others,8,"A 16 year old female presents with a purpuric rash on her buttocks, arms and back of legs.  The lesions began as erythematous macules.  She is complaining of arthralgia and abdominal pain with some bloody diarrhoea.  She had a cold about one week ago.  On dipstick of urine there is evidence of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the likeliest outcome?
",Steroids required for full recovery,Chronic kidney disease,Full recovery,Acute renal failure without full recovery,Recurring episodes,C,"Henoch Schonlein purpura is the most likely diagnosis.  It is a vasculitis and presents in children with a higher incidence in males.  It leads to a purpuric rash on ulnar side of arms, buttocks and back of legs which begin as erythematous macules. A URTI can precede it's development. Arthralgia, abdominal pain and diarrhoea are common features.  It leas to eosinophilia and raised IgA.  There is evidence of glomerulonephritis and sometimes a nephrotic syndrome can develop. In the majority of cases HSP is self limiting and there is full recovery. In a minority there is recurring episodes. It is rare in children for end stage renal failure to develop. It is rare in adults but when is does it is more likely to be severe and cause permanent kidney damage. Steroids are useful in severe disease and are useful for relief of arthralgia and GI symptoms."
others,9,"A 16 year old female presents with a purpuric rash on her buttocks, arms and back of legs. The lesions began as erythematous macules. She is complaining of arthralgia and abdominal pain with some bloody diarrhoea. She had a cold about one week ago. On dipstick of urine there is evidence of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Henoch Schonlein purpura,Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome,Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,Physical Abuse,Rhomboidal non combustibles purpura,A,"Henoch Schonlein purpura is the most likely diagnosis. It is a vasculitis and presents in children with a higher incidence in males. It leads to a purpuric rash on ulnar side of arms, buttocks and back of legs which begin as erythematous macules. A URTI can precede its development in 50%. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea are features. It leas to eosinophilia and raised IgA. There is evidence of glomerulonephritis and sometimes a nephrotic syndrome can develop. Steroids are given in severe. The other diagnoses do not lead to this rash."
others,10,A 16-year-old boy has severe inflammatory acne that has not responded to treatment with oral antibiotics. His dermatologist has decided to start him on oral isotretinoin. Which of the following pairs of laboratory tests are required before and during treatment with oral isotretinoin?,Liver function tests and fasting lipid levels,Liver function tests and platelet levels,Platelet levels and serum electrolytes,Serum electrolytes and fasting lipid levels,Serum electrolytes and liver function tests,A,Liver function tests and fasting lipid levels are the correct tests. The other pairs of laboratory tests are not required during treatment with oral isotretinoin.
others,11,"A 16-year-old boy presents with chronic pain in his left thigh over the past few months. He has seen his GP on four occasions and has been given paracetamol and told that these are growing pains. The pain has now reached the point that he refuses to mobilise beyond walking around the house. On examination his BP is 132/72 mmHg, pulse is 67 and regular. Clinical examination is unremarkable apart from the fact that he appears tender over the left femur. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 122 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 8.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 178 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.3 mmollL (3.5-5)   Creatinine 120 µmol/L (79-118)   Alanine aminotransferase 44 U/L (5-40)   Alkaline phosphatase 780 U/L (39-117)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Hepatoma,Osteosarcoma,Paget's disease,Rickets,Stress fracture,B,"Unilateral chronic thigh pain lasting for many months, accompanied by raised alkaline phosphatase, in an adolescent is consistent with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Plain film of the affected bone, accompanied by a CT scan of the area and the chest are the investigations of choice. Hepatoma in the presence of normal transaminases is extremely unlikely. Paget's disease, whilst associated with a raised alkaline phosphatase, does not usually occur in this age group. Rickets would not be expected to occur in a single bone, and a stress fracture would not present with many months of pain."
others,12,"A 16-year-old boy presents with scaly patches on his scalp. Examination reveals well-circumscribed, circular areas of hair loss, 2-5 cm in diameter with scaling and raised margins. There is no scarring. What is the most likely cause in this patient?",Discoid lupus erythematosus,Lichen planus,Morphea,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Tinea capitis,E,"This patient had non-scarring alopecia due to invasion of hairs by dermatophytes, most commonly Trichophyton tonsurans. The most common causes of nonscarring alopecia include telogen effluvium, androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, tinea capitis, and traumatic alopecia. Less commonly, non-scarring alopecia is associated with lupus erythematosus and secondary syphilis. Scarring alopecia is more frequently the result of a primary cutaneous disorder such as lichen planus, folliculitis decalvans, cutaneous lupus, or linear scleroderma (morphea)."
others,13,A 16-year-old girl is admitted after taking a paracetamol over dose 4 hour ago. She has consumed large amounts of alcohol. Her plasma paracetamol concentration is just below the concentration that would suggest treatment. What should be the treatment option for her?,Refer to psychiatry ward,Refer to medical ward,N-acetylcystine,Serum plasma paracetamol,No further investigation,A,Short term acute alcohol consumption causes enzyme inhibition as in present case and even then paracetamol level is under treatment level. So the patients drug level is in safe side but simultaneous drug overdose and alcohol consumption needs psychiatric evaluation and hence the option here is A
others,14,A 16-year-old girl is seen in clinic as she is concerned due to areas of hair loss on the scalp. Past medical history includes atopic eczema and she has a number of depigmented areas on her hands. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Alopecia areata,Hypothyroidism,Seborrhoeic dermatitis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Trichotillomania,A,This girl has a combination of vitiligo and alopecia areata which can co-exist and have similar autoimmune aetiology. Discrete areas of hair loss and normal texture on the scalp are highly suggestive of alopecia areata. 
others,15,"A 17-year-old girl presents after having ingested 50 of her mother's fluoxetine tablets, approximately five hours previously. Which one of the following clinical features is compatible with this history?",Heart rate of 30 beats per minute,Pupillary constriction,QRS duration of 120 ms (<100),Respiratory rate of six breaths per minute,Vomiting,E,"Unlike the tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, like many of the SSRIs are safe in overdose and cause very few adverse effects. Rarely, reports would suggest that tachycardia can occur together with:  tremor drowsiness nausea, and vomiting.  Pupillary constriction or respiratory suppression suggests opiates. Prolonged QRS complex is consistent with TCA overdose."
others,16,"A 17-year-old girl presents with a two week history of urticaria. Over the last couple of days she has been aware of new lesions occurring on a daily basis, with the old lesions disappearing within 24 hours. Which one of the following statements is most likely to be correct?",She is likely to have an associated asthma,She is likely to have taken penicillin recently,She is unlikely to have any identifiable trigger factor,The lesions will be present for at least 24 hours,There is likely to be a nut allergy,C,"Uritcaria can be classified into idiopathic, immune, or non-immune. Up to 50% of cases are idiopathic, as is likely in this case where the episodes do not seem to be associated with exposure to a particular substance. Peanut allergy and penicillin may cause urticarial rashes but there is usually an associated specific history of contact with the allergen. Urticarial lesions usually last less than 24 hours, but it is possible that multiple crops may appear."
others,17,A 17-year-old lady presents to the A&E department after taking 45 tablets of paracetamol following an argument with her boyfriend. The incident happened 10 hours ago. What is the single most appropriate next action?,Activated charcoal,Check paracetamol level,N-acetylcysteine,Observe,Do blood tests after 4 hours,C,"If >8–24h and suspicion of large overdose (>7.5g) err on the side of caution and start N-acetylcysteine, stopping it if level below treatment line and INR/ALT normal"
others,18,"A 17-year-old male has stolen a car and crashes it at approximately 60 mph into a brick wall. He is extracted by the emergency services and brought to the Emergency Department. He is triple immobilised and is haemodynamically stable. He is complaining of some neck pain and severe chest pain, but otherwise does not seem to have any other injuries. A chest x ray and pelvic x ray are taken as adjuncts to the primary survey. The initial chest x ray shows a widened mediastinum. What should be the next step in the patient's management?",Admit to ward for observation,Chest drain insertion,Computed tomography (CT) of the patient's chest,Emergency department thoracotomy,Wait one hour then repeat chest x ray,C,"The rapid acceleration-deceleration injury force is the classic mechanism for traumatic aortic disruption and when this patient first presents to the Emergency department, there should be a high index of suspicion for this injury. A widened mediastinum may be the only clue on the initial chest film. This can be difficult to assess with the quality of the PA film obtained. As the patient is haemodynamically stable a CT scan of the patient's chest would be the next most appropriate step. He should have 2 large bore IV lines in place and a doctor should go with the patient to the scanner."
others,19,"A 17-year-old man comes to the clinic. He has recently returned from a holiday to Spain with his friends and is very disappointed with the quality of his tan, as there appear to be large depigmented areas on the skin of his abdomen and on his back. He says the areas are itchy. On examination you confirm the depigmentation, and there is superficial scaling over the areas. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Oral antifungals,Oral corticosteroids,Reassurance,Topical antifungals,Topical corticosteroids,D,"This patient has clinical findings which are typical of those seen in pityriasis versicolor, caused by a fungus known as Malassezia furfur. This causes more of a problem in hot weather, is present on the skin of the trunk, and leads to the depigmentation seen here. Topical antifungals are the treatment of choice; if the depigmentation is extensive, a systemic compound like fluconazole may be used. All of the other options are not indicated."
others,20,"A 17-year-old pregnant female attends antenatal clinic and is noted to have scattered, small, raised lesions on her trunk and axillary freckles. She was not aware of any of her family members having these lesions. Which of the following is the likely mode of inheritance of this condition?",Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Trinucleotide repeating,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,A,This patient has neurofibromatosis with axillary freckling and neurofibromas. This is usually inherited as autosomal dominant although it may arise from a sporadic new mutation of the NF1 gene.
others,21,A 20 year old female presents with plaques at her scalp margins and on her knees. On examination there is evidence of hyperkeratotic plaques. Hair is sent for mycology and shows no growth. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Tinea Capitis,Pityriasis Rosea,Psoriasis,Eczema,Seborrhoeic dermatitis,C,The most likely diagnosis is Psoriasis with the hyperkeratotic plaques and negative mycology excluding tinea capitis. The Kobner Phenomenon is a feature of psoriasis. The underlying pathology is increased skin turnover reflected by acanthosis and parakeratosis and there is a mixed neutrophilic and lymphohistiocytic perivascular infiltrate in the dermis.
others,22,A 20 year old male presents with a rash to his GP. It is predominantly over his trunk and there is multiple papules and red scaly plaques with some looking like rain drops. These are itchy. He has recently been unwell with presumed strep. throat. He has recently had sex with a new partner. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Reiters syndrome,Pityriasis,Guttate psoriasis,Secondary syphilis,Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis,C,"The history and clinical findings are indicative of Guttate Psoriasis. Secondary syphilis can lead to a similar rash however there is no evidence of primary infection. Reiters Syndrome is a triad of arthritis, urethritis and conjunctivis and a rash which classically affects the palms and soles. It is often secondary to gonococcal infection."
others,23,"A 20 year old present with diarrhoea, weight loss and an itchy rash on her scalp, elbows and buttocks. You suspect dermatitis herpetiformis. On a skin biopsy, what immunoglobulins is likely to be found on immunofluorescence?",IgE,IgM,IgD,IgA,IgG,D,"In dermatitis herpetiformis, there is formation of subepidermal blisters and IgA deposits are found within the dermal papillae."
others,24,"A 20-year-old boy is brought by his parents suspecting that he has taken some drug. He is agitated, irritated and can’t sleep. Exam: perforated nasal septum. Which of the following is the most likely to be responsible for his symptoms?",Heroine,Cocaine,Ecstasy/MDMA/amphetamine,Alcohol,Opioids,B,drug abuse with perforated nasal septum indicates cocaine abuse
others,25,"A 20-year-old female with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus presents with symmetrical reticulated, violaceous patches, which become more prominent in cold weather involving both lower limbs. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Erythema ab igne,Erythema marginatum,Erythema nodosum,Livedo reticularis,Pyoderma gangrenosum,D,"Livedo reticularis is due to dilation of capillary blood vessels and stagnation of blood within these vessels producing a mottled discolouration of the skin. It is described as being reticular (net-like) cyanotic cutaneous discolouration surrounding pale central areas. It occurs mostly on the legs, arms, and trunk and is more pronounced in cold weather. Mostly it is idiopathic, or secondary to:  malignancy vasculitis SLE, or cholesterol embolisation."
others,26,A 20-year-old male has sustained 20% burns in a house fire. Which one of the following statements concerning this patient is correct?,Convulsions and coma may be expected with a carboxyhaemoglobin concentration of 30%,Hydration should be with intravenous fluids alone,In initial fluid resuscitation crystalloid is the only component of the Parkland formula,The rule of 9s for burns suggests each lower limb represents 9% of the body surface area,When given 100% oxygen the half life of carboxyhaemoglobin falls to four hours,C,"The rule of 9s is used to approximate the body surface area (BSA) burnt. For adults this is:  Head - 9% Upper limbs - 9% each Lower limbs - 18% each Trunk - 18% front and 18% back Perineum - 1%.  Adults can compensate with oral fluids for up to a 15% burn but children can only compensate for a burn less than10%. There is no universally agreed formula for fluid resuscitation in burns. In general colloids have gone out of favour (e.g. Mount Vernon formula: % burn × weight (kg) / 2 in ml of colloid in each of six phases in the first 36 hours, that is at hourly intervals of 4, 4, 4, 6, 6, and 12. The Parkland formula is now the standard formula for the first 24 hours; no colloids are given before 24 hours. For adults the formula is 4 ml × weight (kg) × % burn: 50% in the first 8 hours and 50% in the subsequent 16 hours. Hartmann's solution (compound sodium lactate) or Ringer's lactate in USA is given (their composition is almost identical). Carbon monoxide poisoning is common in fires within enclosed spaces. Symptoms range from a throbbing headache with nausea and vomiting (10-30% carboxyhaemoglobin), to convulsions, coma and cardiac arrest (more than 60% carboxyhaemoglobin). Treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning is with high inspired concentrations of oxygen. The half life of carboxyhaemoglobin is four hours but this falls to 30 minutes when breathing 100% oxygen. "
others,27,"A 20-year-old male presents with extensive, coalescing, hypopigmented, slightly scaly lesions on his back and chest. The rash had been present for two years and had gradually become more extensive. He had otherwise been in good health. The lesions were not symptomatic but he was concerned about their appearance. Which is the most appropriate treatment for his condition?",Aciclovir cream,Ketoconazole cream,Nystatin cream,Oral itraconazole,Oral terbinafine,B,"The patient presents with an asymptomatic eruption on his trunk. The lesions are scaly, hypopigmented, and are not associated with any systemic disease. This is characteristic of pityriasis versicolor, which is caused by the unicellular yeast Pityrosporum ovale and Pityrosporum orbiculare. The yeast is lipophilic and is encouraged by an increase in environmental temperature, thus many patients notice that the condition begins after a summer vacation. It is a disorder of the healthy, but the immunocompromised are at risk. The condition is asymptomatic and appears pale in comparison to the normal skin. The fungus affects the melanocytes hence the hypo-pigmentation. The treatment options include topical imidazole creams, selenium sulphide shampoo and, if not responding to topical treatment, oral itraconazole 200 mg once a day for seven days. In this patient the topical treatment should be tried first."
others,28,"A 21-year-old girl looking unkempt, agitated, malnourished and nervous came to the hospital asking for painkillers for her abdominal pain. She is sweating, shivering and complains of joint pain. What can be the substance misuse here?",Alcohol,Heroin,Cocaine,LSD,Ecstasy,B,"agitation, nervousness, abdominal cramp, sweating, shivering and piloerection, arthralgia these are features of heroin withdrawal"
others,29,"A 21-year-old male is admitted with acute onset headache and is drowsy. He is opening his eyes spontaneously, is disoriented and is localising painful stimuli. He has a normal computed tomography (CT) scan. Which of the following is the most appropriate next investigation for this patient?",Cerebral angiography,Lumbar puncture,Magnetic resonance angiography,Magnetic resonance imaging,No further investigations necessary,B,Lumbar puncture (LP) is not usually required unless the history is suggestive and the CT is normal as in this case. Blood will be present in the CSF (if a bloody tap is suspected the number of red blood cells should fall with each successive sample). If the LP is performed six hours after onset of symptoms the supernatant fluid should be examined for xanthochromia after centrifugation.
others,30,A 22 year old female with severe cystic acne is being started on isotretinoin. Which of he following is the most important in regards to treatment with this drug?,Risk of increased cholesterol and therefore IHD,Exclude pregnancy and commence contraceptive at time of starting isotretinoin,Exclude pregnancy,Exclude pregnancy and commence contraceptive one month before starting isotretinoin,Risk of dryness of skin,D,"Isotretinoin is teratogenic and pregnancy must be avoided. It is therefore recommended that patient's are fully informed of the risk of becoming pregnant and that they have a negative pregnancy test and commence a contraceptive at least one month prior to starting treatment. Patients should be warned of side effects such as dryness of skin and mucous membranes, worsening of acne, elevation of triglycerides and cholesterol levels and risk of hepatitis and therefore they will require monitoring of their LFTs however the most important from these options is the risk of teratogenic effects."
others,31,"A 22 year old female with some bowel habit change presents with a rash on her buttocks, elbows and knees.  It is erythematous with some blistering and it is intensely itchy.  A skin biopsy reveals sub-epidermal blister formation and immunofluorescence reveals IgA present within the papillae.  Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy for her?",Dairy free diet,Gluten free diet,Elemental diet,Topical steroids,Oral steroids,B,The clinical findings and skin biopsy makes the likely diagnosis dermatitis herpetiformis which occurs often in the context of coeliac disease.  It responds like coeliac to a gluten free diet.  Dapsone can be used if  the symptoms do not resolve.

others,34,A 22 year old presents with a rash. On examination there are small salmon pink papules with a fine scale which are drop like on her trunk and proximal arm and legs. She had suffered from tonsillitis two weeks previously. What is the most likely diagnosis? ,Lichen Planus,Dermatitis,Secondary Syphillis,Pityriasis Rosea,Guttate Psoriasis,E,"The history and clinical features are highly suggestive of Guttate psoriasis. It is mostly associated with streptococcal infection but is also associated with stress, trauma and drugs such as antimalarials, lithium, NSAIDs and betablockers. Lichen planus tends to affect flexor surfaces and mucous membranes, is intensely itchy and more violaceous in colour. Secondary syphillis would typically be associated with other features and affects the palms and soles. Pityriasis rosea classically has a ""Christmas tree distribution"" and has a ring of scale and is itchy."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Dermatitis Herpetiformis,Psoriasis,Reiters syndrome,Lichen Planus,Atopic dermatitis,D,"Lichen planus is the most likely diagnosis which presents with very itchy, small and shiny, flat topped purplish papules with an overlying network of fine white lines.  It normally presents on the flexural surfaces of the knees, elbows, ankles and wrists and often affecting the mucous membranes especially the mouth. Koebners phenomenon is present.  Psoriasis does not normally lead to the lesions described nor do the other options."
others,36,A 22 year old presents with red scaly plaques which are itchy on predominantly her hands and also her flexural surfaces. She is known to be asthmatic and has coeliac disease. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Atopic eczema,Pityriasis Rosea,Psoriasis,Contact Dermatitis,B,"The most likely diagnosis is atopic eczema which is common, and is often associated with other atopic traits such as asthma. The history of coeliac disease is a red herring as is dermatitis herpetiformis which does not present with the rash described. The eosinophil count may be high."

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pityriasis versicolor,Chloasma,Leprosy,Psoriasis,Vitiligo,E,The most likely diagnosis is vitiligo which leads to areas of skin depigmentation due to loss of melanocyte function.  It is associated with autoimmune diseases. Leprosy does lead to depigmentation but these patches are also hypoaesthetic and should be considered depending on holiday destination. Chloasma is area of hyperpigmentation and pityriasis versicolor leads to discoloured patches.
others,38,"A 22-year-old female is referred with symmetrical, depigmented areas on the arms and legs but has been otherwise quite well. Which one of the following diseases is most likely to be associated with her skin disease?",Diabetes mellitus,Hyperparathyroidism,Pernicious anaemia,Scleroderma ,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),C,"This lady has vitiligo, which has a number of disease associations. It is the most common depigmenting disorder and affects 0.5% of the world population. Half present before the age of 20 and there is no difference in rate between sexes, skin type, or race. There seems to be a genetic basis to the disease and familial clustering is seen. The majority of diseases associated with vitiligo are autoimmune. Thyroid disease (particularly Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves disease) is one of the strongest associations, and is often screened for in patients with vitiligo. HLA-B13 appears to be the link between thyroid disease and vitiligo. 9% of patients with pernicious anaemia have been shown to have vitiligo, compared to 5.7% with diabetes mellitus. Other associations are Addison's disease, alopecia areta, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis. In addition, vitiligo may be a manifestation of polyglandular autoimmune syndrome, which includes hypoparathyroidism rather than hyperparathyroidism. Both SLE and systemic sclerosis have been associated with vitiligo, but this is less common than with thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia, or diabetes mellitus. "
others,39,"A 22-year-old female presents with a six month history of increasing fatigue and arthralgia of the wrists and ankles. More recently, she has also noted a symmetrical rash on her cheeks and some hair loss. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Dermatomyositis,Hypothyroidism,Porphyria cutanea tarda,Scleroderma,Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),E,"This woman has clinical features consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus. She gives a history of fatigue which occurs commonly in SLE. Arthralgia and arthritis are the most common presenting manifestations of SLE typically affecting the small joints of the hands, wrists, and knees. The symmetrical rash is the classical butterfly rash that occurs in a malar distribution. Alopecia is common and may be diffuse or patchy. In dermatomyositis, there is proximal, symmetrical muscle weakness that progresses over weeks to months. The typical lilac papular rash occurs over the dorsum of the metacarpophalangeal (Gottron's papules), eyelids, elbows, and knees. Hypothyroidism does not commonly result in a symmetrical facial rash. The initial symptoms of scleroderma, now termed systemic sclerosis, tend to be non-specific and may consist of fatigue, weakness, and musculoskeletal complaints. Raynaud's phenomenon is an early symptom. Skin changes include telangiectasia, hyper- and hypo-pigmentation. Porphyria cutanea tarda is either primary or secondary uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency. The commonest symptoms are cutaneous fragility and blistering of sun-exposed skin. There may also be urine discolouration."
others,40,A 22-year-old female returns from a fortnight holiday in Cyprus with a tan and numerous scaly hypopigmented lesions on the neck and upper trunk. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Chronic plaque psoriasis,Discoid eczema,Pityriasis rosea,Pityriasis versicolor,Seborrhoeic dermatitis,D,"Pityriasis versicolor is caused by a superficial fungal infection with Pityrosporum ovale. It usually presents as slightly scaly hypopigmented lesions. Growth is encouraged by an increase in temperature and suntan oils, and is most commonly seen after a sun holiday. Chronic plaque psoriasis, discoid eczema and seborrhoeic dermatitis have distinct appearance and distribution. Pityriasis rosea usually starts with a herald patch followed by small scaly lesions following the rib lines."
others,41,A 22-year-old man consults his GP complaining of redness and itching on his face and hands. He has regularly visited another GP for similar complaints within the last two years and has been signed off on sick leave from employment as a builder. He is in receipt of benefits and reports that he is in the process of making an insurance claim for loss of earnings. He says that there was one ointment that cured the problem but he had not been able to find any proprietary medication that works. Examination showed no skin lesions and no apparent rash. He does not seem worried. He asks his GP to sign his insurance claim paperwork. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Conversion disorder,Delusional disorder,Malingering,Munchausen syndrome,Obsessive compulsive disorder,C,"In somatoform disorders, both illness production and motivation are unconscious drives. In malingering, as suggested here, the patient consciously fakes or claims to have a disorder in order to attain a specific gain (for example, financial). Munchausen's syndrome is manifested by a chronic history of multiple hospital admissions and willingness to receive invasive procedures."
others,42,"A 22-year-old woman complains of haematemesis, abdominal pains, and pyrexia for a month. She is admitted to hospital and found to be apyrexial and haemodynamically stable. There are numerous crusted, linear lesions on her forearms. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute intermittent porphyria,Factitious disorder associated with mental health issues.,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Systemic lupus erythematosus,TB,B,"This lady warrants further investigation, but the question asks you what the most likely diagnosis is. The history is very vague and on clinical examination she has no clinical features other than a rash. She is apyrexial on this occasion, and the fact she is haemodynamically stable rules out prolonged significant haematemesis. Linear lesions are rarely caused by organic disease, and should make you query dermatitis artifacta especially when the lesions are in accessible locations such as the forearms.  Porphyria may be expected to have vesicles on sun exposed regions, such as the face, forearms, and legs. However, the history is too long for acute intermittent porphyria. Attacks typically present with autonomic disturbance and sympathetic overactivity, and often with neurological signs, none of which are present here. The history could fit with TB, if the patient has risk factors for exposure. Early morning sputum or urine could be examined to help exclude this diagnosis. A chest radiograph may be indicated. Systemic lupus erythematosus can present in a variety of ways, and can occur in this age group. A more detailed history would be required, and testing ANA (anti-nuclear antibodies) may be helpful. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis typically has a more acute presentation than this, with evidence of hard clinical signs. Shortness of breath is usually evident if pulmonary haemorrhage has developed. Sinus symptoms are often also present."
others,43,"A 23 year old presents with yellow, brownish depressed patches on her shin.  It began as a reddish brown colour and new patches appear if she bumps her leg. She is also complaining of weight loss, polydipsia and polyuria. Which test should be performed?",Cholesterol level,Fasting glucose,Glucose tolerance test,Auto antibodies,Skin Biopsy,B,"This is a classical description of necrobiosis lipoidica which is associated with type 1 diabetes mellitus.  It begins as erythematous patches, most commonly on the shin (but also face, scalp and arms) and then become yellow, depressed atrophic lesions.  The Kobner phenomenon is seen. A fasting glucose should therefore be performed and treatment commenced."
others,44,A 23-year-old female presents with a problem with her nails. Over the last two months they have become rather unsightly and brittle. She has taken a selection of medications for acne. Examination reveals onycholysis. Which of the following preparations is most likely to be responsible for the onycholysis?,Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP),Erythromycin,Isotretinoin,Tetracycline,Topical benzoic acid,D,"Tetracycline is a recognised cause of onycholysis together with eczema, psoriasis, and thyrotoxicosis to name but a few. The COCP can be associated with thrombosis in certain higher risk groups.  Erythromycin is associated with erythroderma in rare circumstances and more commonly electrolyte disturbances.  Isotretanoin is associated with keratitis."
others,45,"A 23-year-old gentleman presents to clinic complaining of multiple swellings over the torso, thigh and head. Each of the swellings is found to have similar characteristics being: soft, 2-4 cm in size, non-pulsatile, non-reducible and not fixed to skin or deep tissues. His brother has similar swellings. Which one of the following conditions is the most likely?",Campbell de Morgan spots,Dercum's disease,Dermatofibroma,Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome,von Recklinghausen's disease,B,"This gentleman has multiple lipomas and the fact his brother has similar swellings makes a diagnosis of Dercum's disease most likely. Lipomas are characterised by soft rubbery tissue and can sometimes transilluminate. When multiple, familial (and often tender) the condition is Dercum's disease. A dermatofibroma is a benign neoplasm of the fibroblasts of the dermis, and as such, would be attached to the skin. Campbell de Morgan spots are very common capillary naevi. Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome is a dominantly inherited genetic condition in which there are haemangiomata scattered over the mucous membranes which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding. von Recklinghausen's disease is an autosomal dominant condition defined as multiple congenital familial neurofibromatosis associated with:  Fibroepithelial skin tags Café-au-lait patches Neuromata, and Phaeochromocytoma."
others,46,"A 23-year-old man is taking part in an expedition in the Andes and has recently ascended to above 3000 metres. Even accounting for sleeping in a small expedition tent, he has a very poor night's sleep and begins to vomit profusely with a severe headache. On examination his BP is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 85 and regular. There are bilateral crackles on auscultation of his chest. You are the expedition doctor and suspect he is suffering from acute altitude sickness. Which of the following is the optimal next step?",Acetazolamide,Descent,Dexamethasone,Furosemide,Oxygen therapy,B,"The headache, nausea, and vomiting is thought to relate to cerebral oedema, which occurs because of changes in cerebral blood flow at altitude. Optimal treatment is clearly to descend to lower altitude if possible. If individuals have previously suffered altitude sickness they may be able to avoid it in future by slowing the rate of ascent to altitude or treatment with acetazolamide. Acetazolamide, dexamethasone, and hyperbaric oxygen may all impact on symptoms of altitude sickness, but they are subsidiary to descent in their degree of efficacy. The pulmonary crackles indicate this gentleman has probably also got high altitude pulmonary oedema. Treatment is again descent and supplemental oxygen. Acetazolamide is preferred to loop diuretics such as furosemide."
others,47,A 23-year-old obese female with known tuberculosis presents with ulcerating nodules on the back of her legs. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Erythema induratum (EI),Erythema marginatum ,Erythema nodosum ,Lupus pernio ,Lupus vulgaris ,A,"EI is a form of panniculitis characterised by chronic, recurrent, tender, subcutaneous, and sometimes ulcerated nodules on the lower legs that may also appear elsewhere. Females are more frequently affected, with a female:male ratio of 7:1 and it is more frequent in younger females. It is found in association with tuberculosis. Erythema nodosum also a panniculitis is also commonly associated with tuberculosis and presents with painful erythematous nodules in recurrent crops over the legs and arms. The lesions however do not ulcerate. Another possibility, although not provided in the stems, is pyoderma gangrenosum. On the other hand, lupus vulgaris is a chronic, progressive, and destructive form of cutaneous tuberculosis in patients with a moderate or high degree of immunity. It occurs more commonly in females than in males. The classical lesions consist of reddish-brown plaques not nodules. The lesions progress by peripheral extension and central healing, atrophy, and scarring. The areas of predilection are head and neck (80%), followed by arms, legs, then trunk. This rash is not the typical description of erythema marginatum (finer rash) or multiforme (blisters, targets). Lupus pernio occurs in association with sarcoid."
others,48,A 24-year-old female attends clinic complaining of numerous depigmented areas on the arms and legs. She is otherwise fit and well. Which of the following diseases is most likely to accompany this skin condition?,Addison's disease,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Pernicious anaemia,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Tuberous sclerosis,B,"The suggested diagnosis is vitiligo which is associated with numerous autoimmune conditions, the most common of which is thyroid disease. It is also associated with Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes and, less commonly, pernicious anaemia. Discoid lupus can be mistaken for vitiligo, but this would be less common than vitiligo. Tuberous sclerosis would be unusual to be diagnosed this late, and in the absence of any other clinical signs."
others,49,"A 24-year-old lady presented with anisocoria, with the right pupil larger than the left, both in a brightly lit room and in a dim lit room. Her mother noticed this only five days ago. The anisocoria was less marked in the dim lit room. Deep tendon reflexes were present and brisk throughout. She occasionally noted horizontal diplopia with a right sided headache. There was no ptosis. Visual acuity was 6/6 on the Snellen chart in both eyes. Which one of the following statements is most accurate?",The diagnosis is Holmes-Adie's syndrome,The diagnosis of a brain tumour needs to be excluded urgently,The diagnosis of a posterior communicating artery aneurysm needs to be excluded urgently,"The pathological (diseased) pupil is actually the left pupil, diagnosis being Argyll Robertson pupil","When doing a swinging light test of the pupils, a right relative afferent pupillary defect is to be expected",C,"The history of anisocoria, with headaches and diplopia should ring alarm bells, in that a life-threatening posterior communicating artery aneurysm/berry aneurysm needs to be excluded urgently. Anisocoria being an efferent problem will not give a relative afferent pupillary defect. Holmes-Adie syndrome is characterised by a tonic pupil, which is larger than normal and constricts slowly in bright light, and absent deep tendon reflexes (most marked in the Achilles tendon). It develops gradually, and is a benign condition. It is thought to be the result of a neurotrophic viral infection. The sudden onset of the symptoms make a brain tumour less likely that an aneurysm. Argyll Robertson pupils are typically bilateral and are small and irregular with an absent light reflex, prompt accommodation reflex and slow response to mydriatics. The most common cause is neurosyphilis, but it can also be seen with diabetes, alcoholism and multiple sclerosis."
others,50,"A 24-year-old lady presents with a tender swelling in her left breast. She had been breast feeding her baby for three weeks and was well up until four days prior to admission when she noted a painful swelling developing. On examination there was a tender, erythematous, warm, fluctuant mass in the left breast. What is the likely diagnosis?",Abscess,Carcinoma,Cyst,Duct ectasia,Fibroadenoma,A,Lactational breast abscesses are usually seen during the first month of breast feeding. They are usually staphylococcal and first line treatment is antibiotic therapy with aspiration under ultrasound control. Multiple aspirations may be required. If it does not settle or recurs then formal incision and drainage may be required.
others,51,"A 24-year-old lady with a BMI of 36 and on the combined oral contraceptive pill presented with a one month history of increasing vertex headaches, worse in the mornings and worse on coughing and sneezing. She also complained of blurry vision in both eyes. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral extensive papilloedema with a lot of flame shaped haemorrhages around and on the optic discs. Which one of the following is the best long term management of this patient?",Changing the combined oral contraceptive pill to an oestrogen based one,Commence on aspirin,Perform lumbar puncture,Reduce weight,Start oral acetazolamide,D,"This patient has idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The best long term management is weight reduction, which can improve her symptoms. Changing the combined oral contraceptive pill to a more oestrogen based one can worsen the symptoms. Lumbar puncture and acetazolamide can help improve the symptoms, but should not be considered as long term management."

others,53,"A 24-year-old man presents with rash, lip and eye swelling, and tachypnoea 15 minutes following a meal at his local Chinese restaurant. On auscultation of his chest there is widespread wheeze. Which treatment should be given immediately?",IM adrenaline,IM chlorphenamine,IV adrenaline,IV atropine,IV hydrocortisone,A,"This presentation is classical for anaphylaxis, which should be treated immediately with IM adrenaline. Patients known to have a severe allergy might carry this in the form of an Epipen.  IV adrenaline should only be used in the setting of cardiac arrest, unless in a critical care setting with expert supervision. IV atropine is indicated in the management of unstable patients with bradycardia. Hydrocortisone and chlorphenamine are indicated in the subsequent management of anaphylaxis, but adrenaline should be used first in patients with respiratory compromise."
others,54,"A 25-year-old male with a history of frequent binge drinking presents 4 hour after having had a take away meal following a nights heavy drinking. He complains of nausea and has vomited on several occasions.After the last vomiting episode, he vomited approximately a cupful of blood. On admission, he smells of alcohol, pulse 100 bpm, BP 140/80 mmHg. He has some tenderness in the epigastrium. What is your diagnosis?",Gastric carcinoma,Mallory-weiss tear,Esophageal carcinoma,Esophageal varices,Peptic ulceration,B,Repeated retching and vomiting is a recognized cause of Mallory-weiss tear which is supported here by vomiting a cupful of blood
others,55,A 25-year-old man presented with night blindness and gradual deterioration of his peripheral visual fields bilaterally. Ocular examination revealed bony spiculed lesions in the peripheral retina of both eyes with attenuated retinal blood vessels. His only other past medical history is that of a first degree heart block. Which one of the following statements is most correct?,There is a one in two chance of him passing this disease on to his offspring,There is a one in four chance of him passing this disease on to his offspring,There is a one in 10 chance of him passing this disease on to his offspring,There is a 100% chance of him passing this disease on to his offspring,There is no chance of him passing this disease on to his offspring,E,"The diagnosis is Kearns-Sayre syndrome. This is a mitochondrial inherited disease, and as such is only passed on by mothers to offspring. It is a slowly progressive neuromuscular disorder associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia and heart conduction defect. Ocular manifestations include ptosis and peripheral retinal bony spiculed appearances. "
others,56,A 25-year-old man with a history of chronic constipation presents with acute perianal pain. The pain has been present for a week and is exacerbated during defecation. He also notes a small amount of bright red blood on the paper when he wipes himself. Abdominal examination is unremarkable but rectal examination is not possible due to pain. What is the likely diagnosis?,Carcinoma,Fissure,Fistula,Haemorrhoids,Perianal haematoma,B,The history of perianal pain exacerbated by defecation and associated with fresh bleeding is typical of a fissure. Visualisation of the fissure is often not possible as rectal examination is frequently too painful. Most fissures are identified in the midline posteriorly and in the acute phase GTN cream is useful bringing symptomatic relief in 2/3 of cases. 
others,57,"A 25-year-old woman has just been diagnosed with chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus. She has no other clinical or laboratory evidence to suggest systemic involvement. Apart from advice on sun avoidance, her dermatologist has decided to start her on oral hydroxychloroquine. While on treatment with hydroxychloroquine, she requires pre-treatment evaluation and regular monitoring by which of the following specialists?",Cardiologist,Gastroenterologist,Haematologist,Neurologist,Ophthalmologist,E,"Eye toxicity is one of the most serious side effects of treatment with antimalarials and requires regular screening. The cornea and macula may be affected by antimalarial medications. Regular monitoring by specialists other than an ophthalmologist is not warranted for patients on treatment with antimalarials, although their services may be required in the event of the uncommon occurrence of systemic involvement of lupus in this patient."
others,58,"A 26-year-old female is admitted to ICU with severe asthma. She is ventilated for one week and receives IV co-amoxiclav/clarithromycin, magnesium, prednisolone, sedatives and muscle relaxants. She improves gradually but two days after stopping muscle relaxants she still is unable to be weaned from ventilatory support. On examination, she is alert but has flaccid weakness of all limbs. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Critical illness polyneuropathy,Guillain-Barré syndrome,Hypermagnesaemia,Prolonged neuromuscular blockade,Steroid induced myopathy,D,"The history suggests prolonged neuromuscular junction (NMJ) blockade which may be exacerbated by both corticosteroids and magnesium. This condition was originally described with suxamethonium due to hereditary reductions in plasma cholinesterase activity. However, drugs and electrolyte abnormalities may exacerbate this."
others,59,"A 26-year-old male epileptic is admitted with temperature and rash. Over the last one week, a rash has developed and he has become increasingly ill. Recently he has had some problems with epileptic control and has commenced carbamazepine with valproate. Examination reveals an unwell patient with a temperature of 39°C, a diffuse erythematous, painful rash with evidence of some lateral sliding of these erythematous areas on palpation. There is also blistering and inflammation of the oral cavity. Which is the likely diagnosis?",Erythema elevatum diutinum,Exfoliative dermatitis,Pustular psoriasis,Toxic epidermal necrolysis,Toxic shock syndrome,D,"This patient's presentation and clinical description suggests a diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to carbamazepine therapy. TEN is a severe mucocutaneous exfoliative disease with an uncertain pathogenesis and a high mortality rate. It is difficult to say whether it is another variant of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and treatment of both are similar. It is often idiopathic but may be associated with:  viral infections leukaemia lymphoma, and drugs (in particular sulphonamides and anticonvulsants).  The suggested association with carbamazipine in this case makes toxic shock syndrome due to Staph. aureus remote which, like pustular psoriasis, would not be expected to affect the mucous membranes."
others,60,"A 26-year-old tall, thin, lady with a known cardiac valvulopathy, was reported to have skin laxity and folds on the back of the neck and her underarms. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral angioid streaks with optic disc drusens. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,Marfan's syndrome,Menkes syndrome,Osteogenesis imperfecta,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,E,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum with angioid streaks is also known as Grönblad-Strandberg syndrome. Ehlers-Danlos and Marfan's syndrome are not associated with laxity and folds of skin on the back of the neck. Menkes syndrome and osteogenesis imperfecta are not associated with angioid streaks.
others,61,A 27 year old female who works in a nursing home is referred to the clinic with an itchy rash on her hands.  On examination her hands are excoriated with some bleeding points and there is an erythematous papular rash on both hands with some vesicles.  On patch testing she is positive for latex. How would you manage this patient long term?,Avoid latex gloves,Antibiotics,Oral steroids,Topical antifungals,Topical steroids,A,"This patient has contact allergy to latex and allergen avoidance is the best long term management.  Topical steroids, oral steroids and topical tacrolimus are useful in the short term to control symptoms."
others,62,A 27 year old soldier has just returned from Afghanistan. He has been sent to the dermatology due to a lesion on his right forearm. He states that this began as a small red patch which them increased in size. On examination there is an erythematous raised lesion on his right forearm which has ulcerated and has crusted over. He is otherwise well. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis,Eczema,Psoriasis,A,"Given where the patient has travelled to and the description of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous leishmaniasis. Cutaneous Leishmaniasis is caused by old world protozoa such as L. tropica or Infantum or new world protozoa such as L. Mexicana. This leads to the lesion described. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is a risk in new world leishmaniasis. Visceral leishmaniasis is caused by L. Donovani or Chagasi and affects the reticuloendothelial system and leads to anaemia and hepatosplenomegaly."

Her inspired oxygen is 100%, positive end expiratory pressure is 15 cmH2O and peak airway pressure is 40 cmH2O. Her arterial blood gas shows:    PaO2 6 kPa (11.3-12.6)   PaCO2 6.9 kPa (4.7-6.0)   SpO2 88% (greater than92%)    Which treatment is most likely to decrease mortality in this patient group?",High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV),Increasing tidal volume and respiratory rate on the ventilator,Inhaled nitric oxide therapy,Prone position,Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),E,"This lady is on maximal ventilatory therapy but is still hypoxic. Her high CO2 is a reflection of permissive hypercapnia to prevent overdistension of the lungs with high tidal volumes. Treatment of these patients used to be extremely difficult, with no significant improvement in prognosis seen will any technique. However, in 2010 the CESAR trial demonstrated a significant increase in survival without significant disability with the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ECMO involves connecting a patient's circulation to an external oxygenator and pump, via a catheter placed in the right side of the heart. It requires the continuous infusion of anticoagulant, and as such bleeding is the most commonly associated complication. Infection and haemolysis are also a risk. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a treatment option considered for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients who are refractory to conventional treatments. However, treatment with ECMO has not shown significant reduction of mortality which may be due to inappropriate selection criteria. A recent study^1 published in the NEJM concluded that prone positioning improved outcome in severe ARDS. However, it is only one study in a controversial area. There are a number of studies, including one by the same group, which have not shown a mortality benefit (and others which show a detrimental effect on mortality). Prone positioning is therefore not yet widely accepted in clinical practice, although this may change in the future.   "
others,64,"A 28 year old soldier presents with an itchy rash. He is itchy in his finger webs, wrists and groin and there is evidence of excoriation in these areas. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Psoriasis,Contact dermatitis,Sarcoptes scabiei infection,Tinea Corporis,Lichen Planus,C,"The history is indicative of scabies. AS well as the wrist, finger webs and groin other areas commonly affected are elbows and perineum. Sometimes burrow holes can be observed and mites extracted with a needle. The whole body must be treated with topical preparations such as gamma benzene hexachloride or benzyl benzoate. Due to the lack of the classical rashes in the other diagnoses and the areas affected the other diagnoses are less likely."
others,65,A 29-year-old man who is a keen amateur photographer with his own development studio presented to the Emergency department with confusion. His partner said he had been under a great deal of stress recently and she found him foolishly drinking a developer solution with a poison symbol on it. He is hypoxic and hypotensive. The local poisons unit suggests a diagnosis of cyanide poisoning. Which of the following would be the most appropriate treatment?,Desferrioxamine,Dicobalt EDTA,Gastric lavage with Fuller's earth,Haemodialysis,Penicillamine,B,"Potassium ferricyanide is used chiefly for blueprints in photography, for staining wood, in calico printing, and in electroplating. Kelocyanor (dicobalt EDTA), given by intravenous injection has been proven to be of use when administered to seriously ill victims of confirmed cyanide poisoning. It is itself toxic, however, and can kill if used wrongly. HSE knows of several cases of inappropriate use resulting in hospital treatment. Its administration is beyond the scope of first aid and a recommendation has been made in the past that a 'Kelocyanor kit' should be kept by users of cyanide and transported to hospital with the patient. Unfortunately we are aware of cases where this has misled doctors to treat patients for cyanide poisoning when this diagnosis was not correct. "
others,66,"A 29-year-old pregnant female patient, at 36 weeks of gestation, came to the ER with severe retrosternal chest pain for the last 20 minutes.  On examination, she had a pulse rate of 120/minute, blood pressure 120/70 in right arm and 110/80 in the left arm. She was sweating a lot and complained of nausea too. O2 saturation in room air 96%. Her pregnancy, till this episode, had been uneventful. What is the most likely cause of her presentation?",Acute myocardial infarction,Dissecting aneurysm of aorta,Pneumothorax,Psycogenic episode,Pulmonary embolism,A,"This question discusses one very important topic: severe chest pain in pregnancy. While many of the cases of chest pain are probably innocuous, there are some important causes which must be ruled out to prevent mortality. All of these life-threatening causes are more common in the third trimester, as in our case. In this case, acute myocardial infarction seems the most likely cause, as subsequent discussions will show.  In aortic dissection, we find unequal pulses in the two limbs, or the patient may be pulseless. Nausea, though more common in AMI, can also occur in aortic dissection, as different case reports show.  Pneumothorax usually has oxygen desaturation. Also, if there is severe pneumothorax, blood pressure will be low. Psychogenic chest pain is always a possibility. But the serious organic causes must be ruled out before stamping a case as psychogenic. Especially, in a patient with nausea and diaphoresis, AMI must be thought as first possibility and ruled out by suitable tests. In pulmonary embolism, there may be oxygen desaturation and hemoptysis. When breaking the question down into each differential it is important to rule out each cause. In the absence of large discrepancies in blood pressure measurements a dissection is less likely. As she is not hypoxic a PE and pneumthorax are unlikely. There is no reason to suggest this is a psychogenic episode from the history.This therefore only leave a myocardial infarction as the most likely diagnosis from the options."
others,67,"A 30 year old female present with painful, tender, discoloured nodular lesions on her arms and shins. She has been unwell for some time with pyrexia, arthralgia and malaise. How would you investigate to establish the diagnosis?",Serology,Autoantibodies,Complement studies,Skin biopsy,Chest Xray,E,"The rash described is that of erythema nodosum. It is observed in sarcoidosis commonly and thus a CXR should be performed to establish if there is bihilar lymphadenopathy. It is also associated with IBD, TB, streptococcal infections and drugs such as the COC and penicillin. A throat swab should be performed for beta haemolytic streptococcal infection. Skin biopsy is not useful. Autoantibodies and complement studies are not useful in the diagnosis."
others,68,A 30 year old male presents with recurring painful genital ulcers and oral ulcers. He also has a painful red eye and painful joints. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Herpes Simplex,Syphilis,Behcets syndrome,Stevens Johnson Syndrome,Reiters syndrome,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Behcets syndrome which leads to recurrent orogenital ulceration. It can also lead to anterior uveitis and arthritis. Other less common features are abdominal pain and diarrhoea, aseptic meningitis and cranial nerve palsies. Reiters disease is characterised by urethritis, arthritis and conjunctivitis but does not lead to the ulceration described. Herpes simplex does not lead to arthritis. Similarly syphilis and Stevens Johnson are less likely to explain all the symptoms described."
others,69,A 30 year old male with chronic lower back pain and a history of ulcerative colitis complains of a red painful eye and blurred vision. What is the most likely cause of the pain?,Chorioretinitis,Keratitis,Conjunctivits,Uveitis,Scleritis,D,"Ulcerative colitis and lower back pain, probably ankylosing spondylitis, mean that the patient is likely a HLA-B27 carrier. This is associated with uveitis."
others,70,A 30 year old presents with what sounds like tension headaches to her GP.  On examination you notice that she has one pupil dilated more than the other.  This does not contrict to light however does constrict to accommodation and the rest of the eye examination is normal. She also has loss of her ankle reflexes. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Horners syndrome,Argyll Robertson pupil,Space occupying lesion,Holmes-Adie pupil,IIIrd cranial nerve palsy,D,The correct answer is the Holmes-Adie pupil in an otherwise fit and well individual.  There is no feature suggestive of a Horners syndrome or IIIrd nerve palsy with all other eye movements being normal.  A space occupying lesion should be considered if the history of headaches is suggestive of a raised ICP although is unlikely to account for the dilated pupil.  An Argyll Robertson pupil is due to ciliary damage and leads to a more constricted pupil rather than dilated.
others,71,A 30-year-old man complains of episodes of hearing music and sometimes threatening voices within a couple of hours of heavy drinking. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Delirium tremens,Wernicke’s encephalopathy,Korsakoff’s psychosis,Alcohol hallucinosis,Temporal lobe dysfunction,D,"Alcohol hallucinosis can occur during acute intoxication or withdrawal. It involves auditory and visual hallucinations, most commonly accusatory or threatening voices"

On this occasion he is drowsy and has prominent hypersalivation. Which of the following agents, found on his person, is the likely cause?",Chlormethiazole,Cocaine,Dosulepin,L-dopa,Solvent cannister,A,"Hypersalivation is seen with:  Parasympathomimetic agents Insecticides Arsenic Strychnine Chlormethiazole, and Clozapine.  Solvent abuse may cause an acneiform rash around the buccal cavity. Cocaine abuse leads to hypertension and nasal septum perforation. The other agents are anticholinergic and would cause dry mouth in overdose. "
others,73,A 30-year-old presents to her GP with reduced vision in her left eye. She has previously presented with abnormal sensory changes in her leg which have now resolved.  On examination her visual acuity is greatly reduced and there is evdence of a relevant afferent pupil defect.  All movements of the eye are very painful.  On fundoscopy and neurological examination there is nil of note.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Age related macular degeneration,Optic neuritis,Orbital tumour,Thyrotoxicosis,Retinal vein occlusion,B,"The most likely diagnosis is optic neuritis.  This is evidenced by the relevant afferent pupilary defect and the painful ocular movements.  It is often associated with multiple sclerosis and the history of previous sensation.  Abnormalities suggest that this could potentially be the underlying diagnosis.  Optic neuritis can also be associated with other infections such as , herpes zoster, mumps and measles.  An orbital tumor can lead to painful ocular movements and to reduced vision although this is a much longer time course and there are changes to be seen in the eye.  There is no history of thyrotoxicosis and it is unlikely to cause this reduction in visual acuity.  The patient is too young for age related macular degeneration and there would also be findings on fundoscopy."
others,74,A 30-year-old woman presents with a skin rash. On applying pressure to an unaffected area of skin it was relatively easy to induce trauma. Increased fragility of the skin is characteristic of which of the following conditions?,Acute intermittent porphyria,Epidermolysis bullosa,Neurofibromatosis,Pseudo-xanthoma elasticum,Tuberous sclerosis,B,"Increased skin fragility is seen in a number of disorders and is used as a clinical test in bullous disorders (Nikolsky's sign). Other causes include:  pemphigus vulgaris porphyria cutanea tarda drug reactions (especially pseudoporphyria).  Other causes of increased skin fragility (not associated with bullae) include long term corticosteroid therapy, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and scurvy (vitamin C deficiency)."
others,75,"A 32-year-old pregnant woman came for her first antenatal visit at 8 weeks of pregnancy. She had recently migrated to the UK from another country. She did not have any past medical records and could not specify if she had received the scheduled vaccines in her childhood. However, she said that the part of the world where she came from was underdeveloped in health facilities and she had never seen anyone in her locality getting vaccinated. If the MMR vaccine is to be given to this lady, what is the best time for it?",Immediately,Late 1st trimester,In 2nd trimester,In 3rd trimester,Postpartum,E,"MMR (measles-Mumps-Rubella) is a live, attenuated vaccine. Such vaccines are contraindicated in pregnancy. Thus, the best time for vaccinating the woman is postpartum. The infant should be given all the routine immunisations. Live attenuated vaccine contain live virus. Theoretically, they can be reactivated and can cross the placenta to affect the foetus. Practically, the actual chance is very low but no risk can be taken. Other live vaccines also contraindicated in pregnancy are varicella, zoster, live influenza and BCG.  "
others,76,A 32-year-old woman has had multiple bowel resections for Crohn's disease. She has intestinal failure and is dependent on home parenteral nutrition. She has a Broviac catheter for central venous access. She develops a fever and rigors. No physical signs are demonstrable. Cultures taken both centrally and peripherally grow methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Which would be your next course of action?,Determine the antibiotic sensitivity prior to commencing antibiotic treatment,Do not use the intravenous line until the infection has been successfully eradicated,Remove the intravenous line,Treatment with intravenous teicoplanin for 14 days followed by repeat cultures,Treatment with intravenous vancomycin for 14 days followed by repeat cultures,C,"One of the main complications of parenteral nutrition is infection of the central line. Educating the patient and carers may reduce this. However, line infections do occur and infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Candida are indications for line removal."

What drug treatment would you give her?,Benzodiazepines,Diazipoxide,Lithium,Methadone,Disulfiram,D,Methadone is a synthetic opiate primarily used in the detoxification and maintenance of patients who are dependent on opiates—particularly heroin
others,78,A 33-year-old female attends her GP with concerns regarding a mole. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would raise suspicion that it is a malignant melanoma?,Lesion has irregular edge,Lesion is 5 mm in diameter,Lesion is pigmented uniformly,Lesion is present on face,Lesion is smoothly raised,A,The mnemonic of ABCDE regarding characteristics of a melanoma are as follows:  A - Asymmetry - one half of the lesion does not match the other half B - Border irregularity C - Colour variegation - pigmentation is not uniform D - Diameter- a diameter 7 mm warrants investigation although changes in size are also important E - Evolution - evolving size or changes in characteristics such as nodules.
others,79,A 33-year-old female is admitted with erythema multiforme (EM) and erythematous lesions of the mouth and eyes. Which one of the following drugs may account for her presentation?,Diazepam,Fluoxetine,Mebeverine,Oral contraceptive,Sulfasalazine,E,"Many drugs have been implicated in the development of erythema multiforme, and the Stevens-Johnson syndrome subtype. Most commonly associated is allopurinol.

Of the options given, sulphasalazine is the most commonly associated. "
others,80,A 33-year-old lady who is a drug addict wants to quit. She says she is ready to stop the drug abuse. She is supported by her friends and family. What drug treatment would you give her?,Benzodiazepines,Diazipoxide,Lithium,Methadone,Disulfiram,D,"Methadone is an opioid medication. Methadone reduces withdrawal symptoms in people addicted to heroin or other narcotic drugs without causing the ""high"" associated with the drug addiction and thus used to help a drug addict to quit from drug addiction"
others,81,"A 34 year old man with diabetes presents with painless loss of vision in his right eye when woke up that morning. He has a 12 year history of diabetes and 5 year history of controlled hypertension. With his right eye he can only distinguish light from dark. Pupil reactions are normal. Fundoscopy shows boat shaped pre-retinal haemorrhage, neovascularisation near the optic disk, cotton wool spots and microaneurysms. What has caused the sight loss?",Hypertensive retinopathy,Branch retinal vein occlusion,Proliferative diabetic retinopathy,Stroke,Background (non-proliferative) diabetic retinopathy,C,Neovascularisation near the optic disc and preretinal haemorrhage is indicative of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This is the most advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy in which fragile vessels grow on the retina and in the vitreous chamber. These easily bleed causing floaters if small or completely blocking sight if large. Microaneurysms and cotton wool spots suggest non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Branch retinal vein occlusion is a partial visual loss and hypertensive retinopathy is bilateral.
others,82,A 34-year-old alcoholic is found passed out in front of a local pub. The ambulance crew informs you that he was sweating when they found him and there were cans of cider lying empty around him. What is the initial stage of investigation?,Capillary blood sugar,CT head,MRI head,ABG,MCV,A,Alcohol induced hypoglycemia can present as this case
others,83,"A 34-year-old man, who has just recovered from gastroenteritis following a recent trip to Turkey, suddenly developed progressive gait ataxia and restriction of eye movements in all directions of gaze. There was no nystagmus. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cerebellar degeneration,Millard-Gubler syndrome,Miller-Fisher syndrome,Parinaud's syndrome,Subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord,C,"Miller-Fisher syndrome is a variant/spectrum of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). GBS is associated with Campylobacter jejuni infection, which can trigger this syndrome. Miller-Fisher is classically described as a triad of  External ophthalmoplegia Ataxia Areflexia  so the above history would be most in keeping with Miller-Fisher syndrome."
others,84,A 35 year old gentleman presents to his GP with a firm ulcerated lesion of his nostril and nasal septum. He has just returned from travelling in South America. He is otherwise well. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Malignant Melanoma,Leprosy,Basal cell carcinoma,Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis,Squamous cell carcinoma,D,The history is indicative of Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis with the key being involvement of the nasal septum.
others,85,A 35 year old male presents with bald patches. These are well defined and there is no evidence of scarring. There is some broken hairs surrounding these areas. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Tinea capitis,Discoid lupus,Alopecia areata,Psoriasis,Telogen effluvium,C,"Alopecia areata leads to well defined areas of baldness with no scarring. Broken hairs may be seen at the edge which can be depigmented. Nail dystrophy in the form of pitting may be observed. It is autoimmune and associated with other autoimmune disorders. There may be a genetic component. Discoid Lupus leads to baldness but there is evidence of inflammation and scarring, scaling and follicular plugging and hair does not regrow unlike in alopecia where is usually fully recover in about 18 months. Telogen effluvium is a generalised, diffuse hair loss often seen in pregnancy but also in stress and malnutrition. Tinea capitis would show scaling and microscopic examination should be done to exclude this."
others,86,A 35 year old man with inflammatory bowel disease presents with an ulcer. On examination he has a deep ulcerating lesion on his leg. How would you confirm the diagnosis?,No further investigations,Biopsy and culture from the ulcer,Doppler Ultrasound,Autoantibodies,Immunoglobulins,B,"Pyoderma gangrenosum is a ulcerating disease which can occur with IBD. For diagnosis a biopsy and culture is required with a biopsy showing neutrophilic infiltration, haemorrhage and necrosis. Culture excludes infection. Steroids, both topical and oral have a role in management as does ciclosporin as a second line."
others,87,"A 35 year old presents with red scaly patches on her face, scalp and hands.  On examination there is evidence of red plaques on her face, hands and scalp with some bald patches.  Some of the patches are scarring and discoloured.  What is the diagnosis that fits best with this clinical picture?",SLE,Chronic discoid lupus erythematosus,Seborrhoeic Dermatitis,Psoriasis,Drug induced lupus,B,"The most likely diagnosis is CDLE.  It leads to scaly, erythematous plaques on sun exposed areas.  It is a chronic disease, relapsing and remitting and eventually the plaques atrophy and scar, undergo pigment change and lead to telangiectasia.  It is treated with sun block and steroids.  Psoriasis does not lead to the scarring and pigment change.  Similarly neither does seborrheic dermatitis and does not lead to plaques."
others,88,"A 35 year old presents with red scaly patches on her face, scalp and hands.  On examination there is evidence of red plaques on her face, hands and scalp with some bald patches.  Some of the patches show evidence of scarring and discolouration with hyperpigmentation at the border. He is complaining of vague joint pain. Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment is useful if systemic treatment is required?",Prednisolone,Azathioprine,Methotrexate,PUVA,Hydroxychloroquine,E,"The most likely diagnosis is CDLE.  It leads to scaly, erythematous plaques on sun exposed areas.  It is a chronic disease, relapsing and remitting and eventually the plaques atrophy and scar, undergo pigment change and lead to telangiectasia. Minimising sun exposure and using sun screen is essential. Topical steroids are often used first line. However patients are at risk of developing SLE and if systemic treatment is required e.g. if widespread involvement or despite topical treatment new plaques are appearing then hydroxychloroquine is utilised first line. If there is very resistant cases azathioprine, ciclosporin or mycophenolate mofetil may be useful."
others,89,"A 35-year-old lady presents with painful ulcers on her vulva, what is the appropriate investigation which will lead to the diagnosis?",Anti-HSV antibodies,Dark ground microscopy of the ulcer,Treponema palladium antibody test,Rapid plasma regain test,VDRL,A,"Genital Herpes may be asymptomatic or may remain dormant for months or even years. When symptoms occur soon after a person is infected, they tend to be severe. They may start as multiple small blisters that eventually break open and produce raw, painful sores that scab and heal over within a few weeks. The blisters and sores may be accompanied by flu-like symptoms with fever and swollen lymph nodes. There are three major drugs commonly used to treat genital herpes symptoms: acyclovir (Zovirax), famciclovir (Famvir), and valacyclovir(Valtrex). These are all taken in pill form. Severe cases may be treated with the intravenous (IV) drug acyclovir"
others,90,"A 35-year-old man has just been diagnosed with dermatitis herpetiformis. Besides starting on a gluten-free diet, his dermatologist has decided to start him on oral dapsone. Which laboratory test needs to be within the normal range before commencing therapy?",Fasting glucose,Fasting lipids,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) levels,Haemoglobin-A1C levels (HbA1C),Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) levels,C,"G6PD deficiency is an absolute contraindication to treatment with dapsone as it can lead to severe haemolytic anaemia. This is probably due to the N-hydroxy metabolites of dapsone, which are direct haemolytic agents. When allowed to build up to large enough amounts, they induce premature sequestration of the red cell in the spleen. Abnormal HbA1C, fasting lipids and fasting glucose levels are not considered contraindications to treatment with dapsone. TPMT levels are used to decide on starting doses of azathioprine."
others,91,A 35-year-old man is admitted following a serious attempt at paracetamol overdose. Despite efforts to treat him he develops liver failure. Which of the following is most likely with the ensuing liver failure?,Better prognosis in older patients,Better prognosis in those with high alcohol consumption,Hypoglycaemia rarely happens within 12 hours of onset of encephalopathy,It is harmful to give N-acetylcysteine,Lactic acidosis is recognised complication,E,"Use of intravenous N-acetylcysteine reduces morbidity and mortality in fulminant hepatic failure. Severe hypoglycaemia affects 40% of patients with fulminant liver failure, which exacerbates encephalopathy. It may develop rapidly and recur with sepsis. Lactic acidosis is due to decreased hepatic lactate clearance, compounded by poor peripheral perfusion and increased lactate production. The prognosis is poor in those with  Blood PH less than 7.0 Prolonged prothrombin time (more than 100s) and Serum creatinine more than 300 uM.  Mortality is greater if the patient is more than 40 years of age."
others,92,"A 35-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic with a strange rash which affects the dorsum of his hands and feet and the extensor surface of his arms. He has no past medical history of note. On examination his BP is 122/72 mmHg, pulse is 70 and regular. He has a number of lesions, formed by rings of papules, about 1-5 cm in diameter. The centres of these lesions look depressed, with slightly increased pigementation, but the overlying skin is normal. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 133 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 5.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 199 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 92 µmol/L (79-118)   ESR 12 mm/hr (less than10)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Erythema multiforme,Erythema nodosum,Granuloma annulare,Lichen planus,Psoriasis,C,"These lesions are typical of granuloma annulare, a benign inflammatory condition which leads to the formation of dermal papules, and where lesions become larger, annular plaques. The aetiology of the condition is unknown, and multiple lesions occur in the age range 30-60 years. Generalised disease is somewhat difficult to manage, although small trials of oral steroids, dapsone, ciclosporin, and anti-TNF antibodies have taken place. The clinical scenario described is not typical of any of the other options given:  erythema multiforme is described usually as multiple target lesions erythema nodosum as raised red papules on the shins lichen planus often associated with changes within the buccal mucosa, and psoriasis associated with scaling lesions."
others,93,A 35-year-old woman is seen on the emergency intake with abdominal pain. She admits to having been recently referred to an endocrinologist by her general practitioner for investigation of Addison's disease. Which biochemical result would be in keeping with a diagnosis of Addison's disease?,A low urea,Hyperglycaemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia,C,"The classical biochemical features of Addison's disease are:  Hyperkalaemia Hyponatraemia A raised urea, and Hypoglycaemia.  Clinical features of Addison's disease include:  Hyper-pigmentation Weight loss Lethargy, and Hypotension.  The diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency can be confirmed using an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. It is also crucial to ensure adequate glucocorticoid levels pre-and post-operatively to prevent adrenal crisis."
others,94,"A 35-year-old woman presents with a facial rash which had been present for one year. On examination she had erythematous, scaly, indurated plaques on both cheeks with areas of scarring alopecia. Hyperkeratosis over dilated hair follicles was also seen. Which of the following is the diagnosis?",Acne rosacea,Discoid lupus erythematosus,Impetigo,Lupus pernio,Psoriasis,B,"The patient has discoid lupus as suggested by the indurated plaques on cheeks, the scarring alopecia and hyperkeratosis over the hair follicles. Acne Rosacea usually affects the face in a butterfly distribution with pustulant vesicles.  Impetigo is following Staphlycoccus infection of the skin and presents with golden dry crusted lesions.  Psoriasis affects the extensor surfaces commonly with raised purple white plaques and itch.  Lupus pernio commonly affects the face or nose and is a cutaneous manifestation of sarcoidosis."
others,95,A 36-year-old female presents with raised erythematous tender lesions on both legs which have developed since she had a throat infection two weeks ago. Which one of the following investigations is most likely to establish the diagnosis?,Anti-streptolysin-O titre (ASOT),Chest x ray,Mantoux test,Throat swab cultured for bacteria,Throat swab cultured for viruses,A,This lady presents with tender lesions two weeks after a sore throat. This is most likely to be post-streptococcal erythema nodosum and ASOT is most likely to confirm this. A Chest X Ray and Mantoux test are unlikley to be diagnostic and the yeild from a viral or bacterial throat swab is less likley than ASOT.
others,96,A 37 year old male notices a blistering rash on his hands developing after working on a sunny day in the garden. This has occurred previously and led to some scarring. He has also noticed some hair developing on his cheek. What investigation would you perform to confirm the diagnosis?,Blood cultures,Plasma and urinary uroporphyrins,Autoantibodies,Patch testing,Skin biopsy,B,"The most likely diagnosis is porphyria cutanea tarda (deficiency of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase leading to uroporphyrinogen III, accumulation). It can be inherited or secondary to alcohol related liver disease. It leads to blister formation and scarring, hypertrichosis in face and scarring alopecia in severe. It is confirmed by increased plasma and urinary uroporphyrins."
others,97,A 37-year-old homosexual male presented to the medical take with an acute onset of reduced vision in his left eye. Fundoscopy of the left eye revealed an extensive 'brushfire-like' lesion in the major superior temporal arcade with a large patch of white fluffy lesion mixed with extensive retinal haemorrhages. What is the most likely diagnosis?,CMV retinitis,Ocular histoplasmosis,Syphilitic choroiditis,Syphilitic neuroretinitis,Tuberculous periphlebitis,A,"This is a classic example of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis secondary to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), as is suggestive of the information given in this scenario. Ocular histoplasmosis and syphilitic choroiditis would give a fundus picture of multiple whitish lesions. Syphilitic neuroretinitis would normally give a picture of a macular star exudation. Tuberculous periphlebitis is the next closest answer, but does not fit the description of 'brushfire-like' lesion in that it gives a picture of perivenous sheathing and minimal retinal haemorrhages."
others,98,A 37-year-old receptionist presents to the surgical outpatient clinic with a two week history of periareolar inflammatory mass with discharge in her right breast. There is slight retraction of the nipple. It is diagnosed to be a mammary duct fistula. Which one of the following is the most appropriate management in this patient?,Fine needle aspiration cytology,Fistulectomy,Mastectomy and axillary clearance,Radical mastectomy,Wide local excision and axillary node sampling,B,"A mammary duct fistula is a communication between the skin (usually in the periareolar region) and a breast duct. The underlying pathology is usually a periductal mastitis or rarely, granulomatous mastitis. The median age of women developing mammary duct fistula is around 35 years. Retraction of the nipple at the site of the involved duct is present in almost all the patients. Excision of the involved duct and fistula alone (fistulectomy) or excision of the fistula combined with total duct excision (Hadfield's procedure - radical subareolar duct excision) under antibiotic cover, is the treatment of choice for this condition."
others,99,A 37-year-old woman presents with sudden onset painful visual loss in her left eye. She has a history of previous mononeuritis affecting her left and right common peroneal nerves on separate occasions over the past three years. She has 6/36 vision in her left eye with loss of colour sensitivity. Which of the following would you be most likely to see on visual evoked potential (VEP) examination of her right eye?,Delayed latency,Increased amplitude of the positive peak,Reduction in the amplitude of the first negative peak,Reduction in the amplitude of the second negative peak,Reduction in the amplitude of the positive peak,A,"Delays in latencies indicate demyelination in the anterior visual pathways. Changes in amplitude would not necessarily be expected because it is conduction velocity which is affected by demyelination. Amplitude reduction is seen against a background of retinal disease which interferes with signal transduction. Amplitude reduction is also seen against a background of refractory errors, but the question asks about VEP examination of the right eye, where there is no reported loss in visual acuity, so it is purely delayed latency that should be seen."
others,100,A 38-year-old female presents with red target lesions confined to the hands and is diagnosed with erythema multiforme. Which of the following could be the cause?,COVID-19 infection,Group B streptococci,Langerhan's cells histiocytosis,Penicillin V,Ureaplasma urealyticum,D,"Potential causes of erythema multiforme include: Infections:  viruses - herpes simplex 1 and 2, hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), enteroviruses small agents - Mycoplasma pneumoniae bacteria - Group A Streptococcus, eosina, and other - Mycobacterium tuberculosis, histoplasma, coccidioides.  Neoplasia:  leukaemia, and lymphoma.  Antibiotics:  penicillins sulphonamides isoniazid, and tetracycline.  Anticonvulsants:  phenytoin phenobarbitone, and carbamazepine.  Other caused include:  aspirin radiation therapy etoposide NSAIDs sunlight, and pregnancy."
others,101,"A 38-year-old male is admitted with an hour history of chest pain, confusion and agitation commencing shortly after taking a recreational drug. On examination, he is confused, has a temperature of 38.3°C and a blood pressure of 188/102 mmHg. Which of the following drugs is most likely to be responsible for his presentation?",Cocaine,Ecstasy (MDMA),Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB),LSD,Opiates,A,"In this scenario, the young male presents with confusion and agitation following drug abuse. The most likely agent is cocaine. Through central effects, cocaine induces sweating, pyrexia and also adrenergic mediated hypertension. It may also be responsible for coronary and cerebral artery spasm causing infarction. "
others,102,A 38-year-old man with longstanding alcohol dependence has vertigo and a tremor every morning. What is the SINGLE most likely diagnosis?,Anxiety,Benign positional vertigo,Cerebellar degeneration,Optic neuritis,Temporal lobe epilepsy,C,chronic alcohol abuse that leads to temporary or permanent cerebellar damage
others,103,A 38-year-old woman has erythematous plaques with hyperpigmentation at the edge and central hypopigmentation. Serological tests are unremarkable and the patient is diagnosed with discoid lupus. Which of the following therapeutic strategies is most appropriate initially?,Cyclophosphamide,Dapsone,Methotrexate,Oral prednisolone,Sun protective measures,E,"Discoid lupus is photosensitive and so avoiding the sun with protective clothing and sunscreens, and changing behaviour is important. Topical or intradermal steroids and hydroxychloroquine are useful therapies to prevent scarring and new lesions appearing. The latter are less effective if patients continue to smoke. If these treatments are ineffective, second line drugs such as methotrexate, azathioprine, or thalidomide may be used. "
others,104,A 38-year-old woman presents with a palpable nodule in the left lobe of her thyroid. The nodule is aspirated and the aspirate sent for cytology. Which of the following is correct regarding cytology?,Assessment should not be used on impalpable breast lesion,Evaluation is relatively simple to learn,Refers to the examination of cells and is inherently more reliable than histology,Specimens achieved using fine needle aspirations are almost painless,Specimens are reliable achieved using a TruCut® needle,D,Histology is the examination of architectural detail and cellular detail at a microscopic level and is therefore more reliable than cytology. Cytological evaluation requires expert and specialised pathological interpretation. The procedure can be performed quickly and easily in the out-patients department without the need for local anaesthetic. A radiologically guided FNA is a useful way of obtaining tissue on an area of microcalcification seen on a mammogram. A TruCut needle produces a core of tissue which is evaluated histologically. An FNAC is obtained using a narrow gauge (21G) needle attached to 10 ml syringe under suction. This causes minimal discomfort.
others,105,"A 38-year-old woman presents with pain down the lateral aspect of her right hip. She had completed a half marathon for charity the previous weekend, but had previously only managed around seven to eight miles in training runs. She says she noticed the pain after she had warmed down after the run, and says that all hip movements and weight bearing seem to make the pain much worse. It also seems to radiate down to the lateral aspect of her thigh, and she has problems lying on the affected side due to pain. On examination she has point tenderness over the greater trochanter. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 129 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 4.5 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 201 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 12 mm/hr (1-20)   Hip x ray Normal    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Avascular necrosis of the hip,Osteoarthritis of the hip,Septic arthritis of the hip,Tendonitis,Trochanteric bursitis,E,"This patient has a global reduction in movement affecting the right hip, and point tenderness over the trochanter; strong indications of trochanteric bursitis. Both local trauma and an unaccustomed period of exercise may precipitate symptoms. Management involves both appropriate physiotherapy and use of non-steroidals. Some advocates support local corticosteroid injection, and one randomised controlled trial has shown a prolonged benefit with use of hydrocortisone and lidocaine. Her age and past medical history are not suggestive for OA or Avascular necrosis.  Tendonitis would not usually affect the joint in this way.  There are no signs of fever or infection ruling out septic arthritis."
others,106,A 38-year-old woman with a strong familial history of breast cancer has been diagnosed with a breast malignancy. Which oncogene is associated with the development of breast cancer?,BCL-2,BRAC3,HER-2,N-MYC,RET,C,"BRAC1 and 2 together with HER (human epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations have well recognised associations with breast cancer. The loss of the tumour suppressor gene p53 is also associated with many carcinomas. RET is associated with thyroid malignancy, whilst BCL-2 is associated with lymphomas. N-myc (unlike c-myc which is associated with breast neoplasia) is associated with cerebral malignancy."
others,107,"A 40 year old male presents with arthralgia and syncopal episodes.  An ECG reveals complete heart block.  He returned from a hill walking holiday 3 months ago and has noticed an annular, indurated erythematous areas on his legs. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Psoriasis,Granuloma annulare,SLE,Tuberculosis,Lyme disease,E,"The rash described is characteristic of erythema chronicum migrans which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochaete leading to Lyme disease and is transmitted by the ixodid tick.  It can lead to arthralgia and can lead to cardiac abnormalities such as heart block and can lead to neurological features such as cranial nerve palsies.  For diagnosis, serology is required either in serum or CSF."
others,108,A 40-year-old female is admitted with a suspected pulmonary embolism. A ventilation perfusion scan is requested. Which of the following is true of lung ventilation perfusion scanning in suspected pulmonary embolism (PE)?,A normal perfusion scan virtually excludes pulmonary embolism (PE),It is contraindicated if the patient is pregnant,It is contraindicated in those with iodine hypersensitivity,There is reduced perfusion in the upper lobes in mitral stenosis,The appearances of the scan is very similar in those with pulmonary embolism and those with emphysema,A,"Increased pulmonary venous pressure, especially secondary to mitral valve disease, causes increased flow to the upper lobes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually gives rise to matched defects. Radiation to the fetus is small. Ventilation quotient (VQ) scan is not contraindicated in pregnant women, although the perfusion only scan is adequate. Xenon is used for imaging ventilation, whilst technetium labelled macroaggregated human serum albumin (MAA) is used to image perfusion. A normal perfusion scan has a sensitivity of 98% but a specificity of only 40%."
others,109,A 40-year-old female presents with a long history of excessive localised armpit sweating. She finds the problem embarrassing and has problems staining clothes. She has tried antiperspirants without relief. Which is the most appropriate treatment that you would offer this patient?,Amitriptyline,Axillary surgery,Botulinum toxin injection,Propantheline,Topical aluminium salts,C,"This woman has primary hyperhidrosis which can be quite psychologically disabling. In this case the most appropriate treatment would be botulinum toxin injection to each axilla. This treatment is licensed for use and would be the preferred treatment before aluminium salts, as antiperspirants have failed. Similarly, antimuscarinics are associated with systemic side effects that may prove intolerable and their efficacy is really not proven. Pharmacological approaches should be tried before surgery."
others,110,"A 40-year-old female presents with a six month history of pruritic papules, vesicles, and excoriations on the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. Her GP has prescribed topical betamethasone therapy which has been unhelpful. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Atopic dermatitis (eczema),Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH),Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP),Psoriasis,Scabies,B,"The question describes the characteristic distribution of the lesions of dermatitis herpetiformis. DH is one of the immunobullous conditions and characteristically has very intensely pruritic vesicles. It is not usually responsive to topical steroids, but would respond well to dapsone. It is associated with gluten sensitivity and coeliac disease. Atopic eczema is non-vesicular and would respond to potent topical steroids. HSP is a purpuric rash and is non-pruritic. Scabies usually affect the extremities and rarely affect above the neck line. They do not cause papules and vesicles."
others,111,"A 40-year-old male presents with a history of intermittent, but slowly progressive dysphagia for both solids and liquids.

Ba swallow demonstrates proximal dilatation of the oesophagus and failure of relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Oesophageal manometry demonstrates failure of peristalsis and hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter Recommended treatment for this patient should be which of the following?",Amlodipine,Heller's myotomy and partial fundoplication,Intrasphincteric botulinum toxin,Oesophageal bougienage,Per oral endoscopic myotomy,B,"The patient has achalasia, which is a functional obstruction at the lower oesophageal sphincter caused by a failure of relaxation combined with a failure of oesophageal body peristalsis leading to oesophageal dilatation (megaoesophagus). Barium swallow demonstrates a characteristic dilated oesophagus and andquot;rats tailandquot; or andquot;bird beakandquot; appearance distally. Monometric findings are diagnostic. Current American College of Gastroenterology Guidelines (2013) recommend balloon dilatation or surgical myotomy as initial therapy in fit patients. Bouginage is not effective in achalasia. Botulinum therapy is recommended as second line or in patients unfit for endoscopic dilatation or surgery. Pharmacological therapy is reserved those unfit or unwilling for more definitive therapy or failed botulinum therapy. Per oral endoscopic myotomy is currently an experimental technique gaining in popularity."

On examination he had a pulse of 110 beats per minute regular and a blood pressure of 168/90 mmHg. On palpation, he had crepitus over the left supraclavicular region and neck, reduced heart sounds and left basal sided crackles, plus some dullness to percussion over the right base of the chest. What is the most appropriate initial investigation?",CT with oral contrast,Echocardiogram,Gastrografin swallow,Rigid oesophagoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,C,"This man has a history of severe vomiting which then progressed to chest pain. The most relevant finding on examination is the crepitus over the chest indicating surgical emphysema. The most probable cause is spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus. Mackler's triad (vomiting, chest pain and surgical emphysema) is classical but absent in almost half the cases. The chest x ray may confirm the surgical emphysema. Gastrografin swallow will confirm the site of perforation in approximately 65-75% of cases, and is the recommended first line investigation. Barium is more sensitive at 90% for detecting small perforations but carries the risk of a severe inflammatory response (mediastinaitis). A CT with contrast can then be performed to confirm the site of perforation, as well as imaging the other surrounding structures. Lateral neck x rays may be useful in the early stages where the diagnosis is uncertain and surgical emphysema is not seen on a plain CXR. Oesophagoscopy has a role in if the Gastrografin swallow is negative. "

On examination, the lump is about 2 cm × 2 cm in size. Mammogram reveals micro-calcification in the lump and core biopsy reveals an invase ductal carcinoma. There are no palpable nodes or evidence of distant metastasis. Choose the single most appropriate initial management for this patient.",Modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection,Preoperative radiotherapy followed by modified radical mastectomy,Wide local excision and axillary dissection followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast,Wide local excision followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast,Wide local excision with sentinal node biopsy followed by adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast,E,This is clinically a T1 N0 (Stage I) tumour. Two randomised controlled trial have shown no difference in survival between wide local excision with local adjuvant radiotherapy and mastectomy after 20 years of follow up. Wide local excision with sentinel node biopsy is the most appropriate initial management. Subsequent treatment will depend on the result of the sentinel node examination (intraoperative touch prep cytology) and the histology of the primary tumour. Modified radical mastectomy with axillary dissection or radiotherapy is not appropriate for a tumour that may well remain T1 N0 (stage I) after surgery. Wide local excision alone is inadequate. It is essential to stage the axilla as only 70% of involved nodes are detectable on clinical examination. Further therapy to the axilla is not indicated if the sentinal node is negative but axillary clearance or radiotherapy will be required if there is nodal disease

The history suggests a demyelinating process, and failure of ocular adduction in such cases should prompt the diagnosis of internuclear ophthalmoplegia. WEBINO is a rare disorder which consists of a bilateral adduction deficit and primary gaze position exotropia. It is most often seen in patients with multiple sclerosis and those with brainstem stroke, and is caused by bilateral medial longitudinal fasciculus lesions. Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) progresses slowly, and is only usually noticed by patients in the latter stages. It starts with ptosis, which then progresses to a symmetrical ophthalmoplegia with relative sparing of downward gaze. Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome, which manifests as a descending paralysis which classically affects the eye muscles first. Ocular myasthenia is a form of myasthenia gravis which is limited to the ocular muscles. Autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptors of the neuromuscular junction results in fatigability and weakness of the eyelids or eye movement. Parinaud's syndrome is a cluster of abnormalities of eye movement and pupil dysfunction characterised by paralysis of upgaze, pseudo Argyll Robertson pupils, convergence-retraction nystagmus, and eyelid retraction.

others,120,"A 42-year-old man is reviewed prior to discharge having been diagnosed with tuberculosis. He has been commenced on quadruple anti-tuberculous therapy and review is planned in the outpatient clinic. He mentions an irritating red rash affecting both shins, and wants to discuss if treatment is warranted. On examination you identify erythema nodosum. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?",Oral corticosteroids,Reassure that it will resolve,Topical antibiotics,Topical diclofenac,Topical potassium iodide,B,"Reassurance that this condition will resolve is the most appropriate action here. The most likely cause for erythema nodosum (EN) in this case is the tuberculosis. Given that he is committing to quadruple antibiotic therapy, you would expect the EN to resolve as the infection subsides and therefore no specific treatment for the EN is warranted. Topical diclofenac and antibiotics are not effective in this situation. The underlying panniculitis which is responsible for EN is not infective in nature, and responds best, if required to topical potassium iodide. Oral corticosteroids may blunt his immune response to TB and should therefore be avoided. In summary, topical potassium iodide can be considered in patients with very troublesome EN, but other treatment isn't indicated in this situation."
others,121,"A 43-year-old female presents with a weepy, erythematous rash mainly affecting the forehead, scalp, neck, and upper back. Three days earlier she had used red hair dye at home to self-administer 'highlights'. Which is the likely diagnosis?",Acne rosacea,Contact allergic dermatitis,Lupus erythematosus,Psoriasis,Seborrhoeic dermatitis,B,"Hair dye contains substances which may induce an eczematous response in form of contact allergic dermatitis. This type of reaction is typical for this sort of time scale, and is an example of a type IV, or delayed, hypersensitivity reaction. Sensitisation occurs on initial exposure to the allergen and 'memory' T-cells proliferate in lymphoid tissue. Subsequent exposure to allergen induces activation of the T-lymphocytes and an inflammatory response. Hairdressing chemicals are a very common cause of contact allergic dermatitis, a disorder which is very common amongst the hairdressing community. A lady at this age is unlikely to present with a new, previously undiagnosed case of eczema. Acne rosacea is usually a disorder of the skin on the cheeks and nose. Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus presents with an erythematous rash over the face and neck. However there are no eczematous features."

Which one of the following drugs is the most appropriate treatment?",Acitretin,Amoxicillin,Colchicine,Cyclosporin,Dapsone,D,Cyclosporin is a well used drug in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). It is usually at doses of 2-5 mg/kg. The pathophysiology of AD is complex but the T lymphocytes are involved and it is known that there is an increased production of cytokines particularly IL-4. Cyclosporin is a suppressor of T cells and in that respect works very well in atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The side effects of hypertension and renal toxicity limit its use. These patients are seen monthly to have their blood pressure and urea and electrolytes checked. Amoxicillin is used in the treatment in a number of bacterial infections.  Colchicine is used in the treatment and prevention of gout.  Dapsone is used to treat dermatitis herpeteformis.

In this case the patient is homeless and he may well have TB which is associated with erythema nodosum. It is also associated with HLA B8, some infective organisms such as streptococcus, salmonella, chlamydia, mycoplasma and gonorrhoea, CMV, EBV and Hep B. It is associated with certain drugs such as penicillins, oral contraceptives and aspirin. Sarcoidosis should be suspected if there is evidence of erythema nodosum and bihilar lymphadenopathy."

Which is the correct treatment?",Intramuscular adrenaline 0.5 mg,Intravenous chlorpheniramine maleate 10 mg,Intravenous dopamine 50 mg,Intravenous hydrocortisone 100 mg,Nebulised salbutamol 5 mg,A,"The clinical signs of anaphylactic shock include:  Shortness of breath An increased respiratory rate Tachycardia, and Inspiratory stridor.  Sometimes there is evidence of peripheral shutdown. Patients diagnosed to have an anaphylactic shock should be placed in a comfortable, reclining position. High flow of oxygen should be administered and intravenous access secured. Adrenaline is the first choice drug in the management of anaphylactic shock. An anti-histamine drug such as chlorpheniramine maleate is useful to reduce the symptoms. Hydrocortisone has a role in the treatment of anaphylactic shock although its action is delayed. An inhaled agonist such as salbutamol is useful to treat the bronchospasm associated with the shock. Dopamine does not have any role in the management of anaphylactic shock. "
others,126,"A 45-year-old lady with rheumatoid arthritis attended a routine appointment at the rheumatology clinic, and was complaining of a two day history of right red eye with dull pain. She denied any photophobia and there was no ocular discharge noted. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute angle closure glaucoma,Conjunctivitis,Episcleritis,Scleritis,Scleromalacia perforans,C,"Rheumatoid arthritis is associated with both scleritis and episcleritis. The lack of photophobia and discharge, and normal vision, makes episcleritis the most likely option here. Scleritis may cause severe pain and results in diffuse or nodular injection. It usually has a gradual onset, with severe pain which can radiate to the forehead, eyebrows and jaw. This pain is often worse with eye movement and at night. The eye is red (localised or diffuse) with associated watering, photophobia and gradual decrease in vision. 50% of cases are bilateral. 50% of patients with scleritis have underlying systemic disease, of which rheumatoid arthritis is the most common connective tissue disease. Efforts should be taken to exclude underlying disease in patients presenting with scleritis. Management ultimately depends on the underlying cause, but includes NSAIDs and prednisolone. Episcleritis results in ocular irritation with nodules. It is acute in onset, with mild pain or discomfort / grittiness. It can be unilateral or bilateral, with localised or diffuse red eye. There may be mild photophobia and watering, but severe ocular symptoms and visual disturbance is rare. Single episodes do not need to be investigated, and treatment is symptomatic. Scleromalacia perforans is a rare form of scleritis (only 5% of cases) which is caused by necrosis of the sclera. There is minimal or no inflammation, and therefore usually no real symptoms. It is bilateral and usually only seen in severe advanced rheumatoid arthritis. Acute angle closure glaucoma presents predominantly with pain, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting. One would expect significant discharge and pruritus if conjunctivitis were the diagnosis."

Which of the following is the most appropriate first line treatment for him?",Coal tar shampoo,Ketoconazole shampoo,Oral prednisolone,Tacrolimus ointment,Topical betamethasone,B,"This man has seborrhoeic dermatitis which tends to affect hair bearing areas of skin with the scalp the worst affected. It is thought that, at least in part, the activity of activated T cells may be enhanced by an increased reservoir of Malassezia yeasts. As such, regular washing of the hair with a ketoconazole based shampoo has been shown to reduce the severity of the condition. Topical corticosteroids have been shown to hasten recovery, but may be associated with a rebound effect and rapid recurrence of the rash when they are withdrawn. Coal tar shampoo and topical tacrolimus are alternate treatments. Asteatotic dermatitis typically presents in the elderly with pruritic, xerotic, scaly skin typically over the shins but may occur over the back and hands.

It is unlikely to be an isolated high measurement and it cannot be explained by anxiety alone. A small cuff will usually give a false high reading and conversely a large cuff will give a low reading. An ECG is an essential part of the investigations, together with a full blood count (FBC) and urea and electrolytes (as a minimum). The urine should also be tested. Oral antihypertensive therapy should be commenced before he leaves the hospital and follow-up arranged with his GP. Surgery should not be rescheduled until the blood pressure is controlled and at least four weeks have passed. Proceeding with the septo-rhinoplasty should never be considered. This type of surgery requires a significant degree of hypotension (to reduce bleeding) to allow unobstructed surgical access, which clearly would expose the man to the risk of organ hypoperfusion and infarction. Sedation should never be given in preference to an antihypertensive drug."

Carotid-cavernous sinus fistulas usually present with redness in one eye, with progressive pain and proptosis and a bruit within the skull.  Craniopharyngiomas have a very insidious onset of symptoms, which include headache, endocrine dysfunction and visual disturbance.  Carotid artery dissection can result in headache, neck pain, Horner's syndrome, and ischaemic stroke. Onset is rapid, and often results from trauma.

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by increased fibroblast activity and fibrosis in a number of different organ systems. Ninety to 95% of patients have positive antinuclear antibodies. There are two major subtypes:  limited cutaneous, and diffuse cutaneous.  CREST syndrome is an older term for the limited cutaneous form (calcinosis, Raynauds' phenomenon, oeosophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia). Patients with systemic sclerosis can present with the following:  skin abnormalities musculoskeletal changes gastrointestinal complications pulmonary disease renal crisis, and dry eyes and mouth.  A number of autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens can be detected in patients with systemic sclerosis. Anticentromere antibodies and antitopoisomerase I antibodies are the classic autoantibodies associated with the disease. Anticentromere antibodies are linked with limited cutaneous involvement and isolated pulmonary hypertension, and a good prognosis, whereas antitopoisomerase I is linked with diffuse skin disease and pulmonary fibrosis and a higher mortality. Additional autoantibodies which can be detected are antiRNA polymerase, antiU3RNP, antiKu, and antiU1RNP. Anticardiolipin antibodies are seen in antiphospholipid syndrome. AntiDNA antibodies are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Antimitochondrial antibodies are seen in primary bilary cirrhosis. Antimyeloperoxidase antibodies are also referred to as pANCA, and can be seen in a variety of vasculitides. "

Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Allergic contact dermatitis,Fixed drug eruption,Psoriasis,Sarcoidosis,Tinea corporis,E,"Dermatophytosis is common in young adults. It usually presents with annular scaly plaques with active peripheral margins and central clearing resulting in increasing size of the lesions. The lesions are typically itchy and increase in number over a period of time. The affliction of legs and thighs is termed tinea corporis. It is an occupational dermatoses in athletes and may be recurrent in them if due precautions are not taken. The condition is contagious and can typically spread in immediate contacts, such as family members, if treatment is delayed or precautions are not taken. Allergic contact dermatitis will present with itchy papulovesicular eruption at the site of contact of the allergen. Fixed drug eruption presents with erythematous or hyperpigmented macules or patches, sometimes with central bullae. History of drug intake may be forthcoming and a history of other recurrent episodes at the same site may be present. Psoriasis presents with papulosquamous lesions with micaceous scaling.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cushings disease,Hypothyroidism,ITP,Polymyositis,Dermatomyositis,E,The most likely diagnosis is Dermatomyositis. The findings on the knuckles are Gottrons papules and the heliotrope rash around the eyes are characteristic. Nail fold haemorrhages are also seen. It is often associated with malignancy and in this case the gentleman should be investigated for an underlying malignancy especially as he is a heavy smoker. It also leads to a proximal muscle weakness. Steroids and azathioprine are useful in the management.
others,139,"A 49-year-old gentleman is referred to the medical team with a 2-month history of worsening shortness of breath, which is now significantly limiting his ability to undertake activities of daily living. Which of the following findings is most suggestive of a cardiac rather than a respiratory cause?  ",A history of seasonal dyspnoea,Frequent acute exacerbations of breathlessness,Haemoptysis,Lower limb oedema,Orthopnoea,E,"Shortness of breath is common and has multiple causes. Broadly, they can be divided into respiratory, cardiac, musculoskeletal and other causes. Distinguishing respiratory from cardiac causes should take prime place in the history and examination, with adjunctive tests including radiology, lung function and cardiac investigations being used to support these initial assessment findings.  Features of the history may help you determine whether the underlying cause of dypsnoea is cardiac or respiratory:  Haemopytysis is more likely to be present due to underlying lung disease rather than in cardiac causes of breathlessness. Orthopnoea, the worsening of dyspnoea in a supine position, is classically caused by congestive cardiac failure. Seasonal dyspnoea or that which resolves during periods away from work is suggestive of airway disease which is exacerbated by irritants. Frequent acute exacerbations of breathlessness could represent periods of pulmonary oedema, or exacerbations of airway disease amongst other causes and therefore this does not help distinguish between pulmonary and cardiac dyspnoea.  There are also clues on examination to help distinguish pulmonary versus cardiac causes of dyspnoea:  Hypertension is more suggestive of underlying heart-failure, whereas clubbing is suggestive of lung disease (such as malignancy or interstitial lung disease). The presence of ascites is concerning for congestive cardiac failure. Whilst lower limb oedema is often a sign of congestive cardiac failure, patients with chronic veno-occlusive disease can also present with this and therefore it's presence is not as helpful as the presence of orthopnoea in distinguishing between cardiac and pulmonary causes of dyspnoea.  Further investigation of the breathless patient should be guided by the differential diagnosis determined by a good history and examination. Pulse oximetry, FBC, CXR and ABG should be undertaken, with further tests such as D-dimer, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), spirometry, CT chest and ECG monitoring dictated by history and examination findings.

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acanthosis nigricans,Chloasma,Necrobiosis Lipoidica,Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum,Tinea Cruris,A,"The rash described is typical of Acanthosis nigricans which is associated with Diabetes Mellitus, Obesity and Gastric Cancer. The history in this case is indicative of a gastric cancer."
others,142,A 50-year-old male is admitted for elective varicose vein stripping. He has a five year history of type 2 diabetes for which he takes metformin. His last HbA1c checked at annual review was 53 mmol/mol (20-46). Which of the following statements regarding part of his pre-operative management is correct?,Can eat a light/early breakfast on the day of surgery,Is unsuitable for day case surgery,Requires a pre-operative intravenous infusion of Actrapid by sliding scale,Should be admitted the day before surgery,Should be first on an operating list,E,"Diabetic patients, regardless of whether they are insulin dependent (type 1) or non-insulin dependent (type 2) should be scheduled for surgery early in the day. However, placing them first on the list is not always possible and this is widely accepted. Diabetics as a rule are kept nil by mouth for the same duration (six hours for solids and two hours for clear fluids) as all patients scheduled for general anaesthesia. The pre-operative management of diabetics is influenced by the method and efficiency of glucose control, rather than the type of diabetes they have. Patients with poor control of blood glucose should be admitted the day before and started on an insulin/glucose sliding scale until they reach the operating theatre. Thus optimal control of blood glucose can be achieved and monitored by frequent bedside assessment of the blood glucose (for example BM stix). However, this patient's glycaemic control appears good, as reflected by a HbA1c of 53 mmol/mol. Well controlled diabetics can be treated as day cases, but they should omit the long acting oral hypoglycaemic drug or insulin the night before surgery. Blood glucose monitoring is still necessary, but they rarely require an insulin/glucose sliding scale."

others,144,A 50-year-old man presented in the summer complaining of itching and blistering of his hands and forehead. On examination there were small areas of excoriation on the backs of his hands. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Lupus erythematosus,Pemphigoid,Pemphigus,Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT),E,"The distribution of the lesions suggests a photosensitive element. Both lupus erythematosus and PCT are associated with a photosensitive element, however this is more typical of PCT. PCT causes blistering of the hands and the forehead which usually heal with small scar and milia formation. It is also associated with an excessive alcohol intake. Dermatitis herpetiformis is seen in Coeliac disease.  Lupus erythematosus can affect any organ in the body. Pemphigoid and pemphigus present as blistering lesions though affeting different layers of the skin."
others,145,A 51-year-old female is four hours post wide local excision of the left breast and axillary node clearance for breast cancer. She complains of increasing pain from the left breast. The skin and wound is intact. On examination the breast is swollen and tender. Only one drain has been placed in the axilla. What is the most appropriate management in this case?,Analgesia and observe,Removal of axillary drain,Surgical wash out and control and haemostasis,Ultrasound guided needle aspiration,Unguided needle aspiration,A,"Haematoma formation is more common following breast conserving surgery for cancer. Surgical drains may be left in the wound to evacuate bleeding which occurs following closure of the wound. However, meticulous haemostasis should be obtained prior to closure of the wound as the drain may become blocked. Haematoma formation stretches the overlying skin causing pain. Eventually if the wound is not opened and the patient has normal clotting bleeding will stop by tamponade. Aspiration is usually unsuccessful as the haematoma is clotted and cannot be removed via a needle. Surgical control of the bleeding is indicated if the overlying skin is becoming necrotic or the wound has opened spontaneously."
others,146,A 51-year-old male presents with a rash that has been present intermittently over the last two years.

The most appropriate treatment is a tetracycline."
others,147,A 51-year-old woman is attending for a breast screening appointment. Which of the following is true of mammographic screening for breast cancer?,Has been shown to reduce mortality from breast cancer in women over the age of 50,Has no evidence to support screening beyond the age of 70,Is associated with a false positive rate of approximately 15%,Should be offered more frequently to women on HRT,Should be performed annually in women over the age of 50,A,"Mammographic screening for breast cancer has a high sensitivity and specificity, with a false positive rate of less than 10% in younger females, which is even better in older women (5%). Screening is advocated every two to three years in women above the age of 50. There is no evidence to support more frequent screening. Women beyond 70 years of age have an increased risk of breast cancer and it may be more readily demonstrated in this age group with mammography. "

What test would you perform to confirm the diagnosis within the clinic setting?",ANA,Look at urine with an UV light,Urinary porphyrin,Serum porphyrin,Autoantibodies,B,Urinary porphyrias are useful for diagnosis however in the clinic setting using a UV light is very useful for a quick diagnosis as the urine fluoresces pink.
others,151,"A 52 year old with known alcohol excess presents with facial flushing, pustules and telangiectasia predominantly around the nose.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acne vulgaris,Seborrhoeic Dermatitis,Rosacea,Allergic reaction,Drug reaction,C,"Rosacea leads to the symptoms described.  Due to the increased reactivity of the facial vasculature there is facial flushing.  It leads to erythema, telangiectasia and acneiform lesions especially around the nose, cheeks and chin.  Rhinophyma can occur where there is enlargement of the nose due to follicular enlargement and although rosacea is more common in females this variant is more commonly seen in men.  Blepharitis may also be associated. Sunlight, heat, alcohol and certain foods worsen the appearance.  Acne leads to comedo (black head) formation and not facial flushing and is unlikely in a patient this age. Seborrhoeic dermatitis leads to greasy scales and often affects the scalp and different distribution and does not leads to the features described.  The main treatment for rosacea is to avoid triggering factors, oxytetracycline and retinoids in severe cases. Topical steroids can lead to severe worsening of erythema."

Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute intermittent porphyria ,Erythropoietic protoporphyria,Pemphigoid,Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT),Subacute lupus erythematous (LE),D,"The history of photosensitive eruption, hypertrichosis, and milia formation (keratin-containing cysts) are characteristic of PCT. Acute intermittent porphyria usually causes intermittent neurological and abdominal problems. Subacute LE can cause erythema and scarring, but in a patient with increased alcohol intake and hypertrichosis the most likely diagnosis is PCT. Erythropoietic protoporphyria patients get pain and erythema on exposure to sunlight."

Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",Candida spp.,Enterococcus,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Streptococcus viridans,E,Generally there are two identifiable modes of prosthetic valve endocarditis. The first occurs in the first year after surgery affecting 0.7-3% of cases and is often due to Staphylococci. Late endocarditis observed after two years post-surgery is found in 0.5-1% of cases and is typically due to Strep. viridans. 
others,154,A 52-year-old man has undergone a total thyroidectomy for cytologically confirmed papillary carcinoma. A referral has been sent for consideration of radioiodine treatment. Which medication should you commence postoperatively?,Calcium supplements,Dexamethasone,Levothyroxine,Tri-iodothyronine,Vitamin D,D,The patient requires replacement thyroid hormones. Radioiodine therapy is more effective in patients with papillary cancer when they have undergone a total thyroidectomy. For radioiodine therapy the patient must discontinue thyroid hormone replacement; tri-iodothyronine is used because it has a shorter half-life and can therefore be stopped closer to the radioiodine treatment time.
others,155,A 52-year-old man is undergoing an elective repair of an inguinal hernia using a synthetic mesh. As part of the pre-operative checks you request intravenous prophylactic antibiotics. Which statement is correct regarding antibiotic prophylaxis?,Are not required in 'clean' procedures,Dose should reflect the degree of sepsis found,Requires a second dose if the procedure exceeds four hours,Should only be given on induction of anaesthetic,Usually require multiple doses,C,"In adults the full dose of the chosen antibiotic should be administered unless there is a concern regarding excretion, for example, renal failure. In prolonged procedures, a second dose is advised. Otherwise, single-dose prophylaxis is effective in most clinical situations. Clean procedures where synthetic material is implanted require antibiotic prophylaxis."
others,156,"A 52-year-old woman comes to the dermatology clinic for review. She has suffered from blisters and ulcers which have progressed over a number of months to include extensive areas of her upper body, arms and legs. The blisters are painful, but pruritis is minimal. She has a past medical history of hypertension for which she takes lisinopril and indapamide. She also suffers from epilepsy for which she takes carbamazepine. On examination her BP is 128/80, pulse is 75 and regular. You confirm extensive, flaccid blisters, some of which have been de-roofed. The oropharynx is relatively spared. Which of the following would you expect to find on skin biopsy?",Granuloma formation with neutrophilic infiltrates,IgG deposition at the dermo-epidermal junction,Intercellular deposition of IgG,Neutrophils within the dermal papillae,T cell infiltration within the dermis and the dermo-epidermal junction,B,"The answer is IgG deposition at the dermo-epidermal junction. The clinical presentation here is consistent with bullous pemphigoid, which occurs as a result of IgG antibodies which bind to the skin basement membrane. This accounts for the findings on biopsy. Oral lesions are less typically seen in pemphigoid compared to pemphigus where they are much more common. Granuloma formation with neutrophilic infiltrates is seen in patients with erythema nodosum, which has a number of associations but the lesions are more characteristically present only on the shins and do not blister. Intercellular deposition of IgG is seen in pemphigus vulgaris, where oral lesions are much more prominent. Neutrophils in the dermal papillae are a feature of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a pruritic skin rash classically located on the elbows and associated with coeliac disease. T cell infiltration is seen in Stevens Johnson syndrome, which is a rapidly progressive condition characterised by flu-like symptoms followed by an extensive erythematous rash (including the mucosal sufaces) which subsequently blisters."

Which of the following is part of the Glasgow criteria for assessing the severity of an attack of pancreatitis?,Age over 65,Amylase,Creatinine,Haemoglobin,Urea,E,"The Glasgow criteria use nine variables to assess the severity of the pancreatitis. It can be easily remembered using the mnemonic PANCREAS:    P PO2 less than8 kPa (11.3-12.6)   A Age greater than55 years -   N Neutrophils (WCC) greater than15 ×10^9/L (4-11)   C Calcium less than2.0 mmol/L (2.2-2.6) (corrected)   R Raised Urea greater than16 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   E Enzymes LDH greater than600 U/L (10-250)   A AST greater than125 U/L (1-31)   Albumin less than32 g/L (37-49)   S Sugar (Glucose) greater than10 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)    Three positive criteria indicate severe acute pancreatitis. The number of variables relates to the severity and mortality of the pancreatitis. Although CRP is not part of the Glasgow scoring criteria, a raised level is an independent indicator of severity."
others,158,A 53-year-old man presents with a longstanding history of a 1 cm lesion on his arm. It has started bleeding on touch. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Basal cell carcinoma,Kaposi’s sarcoma,Malignant melanoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Kerathoacanthoma,D,"SSCs Arises in squamous cells. SCCs may occur on all areas of the body including the mucous membranes and genitals, but are most common in areas frequently exposed to the sun, such as the rim of the ear, lower lip, face, balding scalp, neck, hands, arms and legs. SCCs often look like scaly red patches, open sores, elevated growths with a central depression, or warts; they may crust or bleed. A tissue sample (biopsy) will be examined under a microscope to arrive at a diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinomas detected at an early stage and removed promptly are almost always curable and cause minimal damage"

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Bullous,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Allergic reaction,Pemphigus Vulgaris,Eczema Herpeticum,D,The most likely diagnosis is Pemphigus Vulgaris which is often seen in middle aged patients. There s blister formation which are very friable unlike the tense subepidermal blisters in Bullous pemphigoid. It often affects the mucous membranes such as mouth or urethra. The skin biopsy results are also indicative. This can lead to odynophagia and dysuria. High dose steroids are required for management.
others,162,A 55 year old female who is on methotrexate for rheumatoid arthritis presents to her GP with a painful red right eye. This came on suddenly and her eye is mildly painful and watering. Her vision has not been affected. On examination there is evidence of redness in the right upper quadrant of the right eye and this is tender. Her pupil is normal as is her conjunctivae. Visual acuity is unchanged and eye movements are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Scleritis,Episcleritis,Corneal Abrasion,Acute Glaucoma,Conjunctivitis,B,The history and clinical findings are inkeeping with a diagnosis of episcleritis. Scleritis presents similarly however it is extremely painful. Episcleritis and Scleritis are associated with Rheumatoid Arthritis and other connective tissue disorders.

Her ankle brachial pressure index (ABPI) is 0.5. What is the best course of action?,Arterial and venous duplex,Compression bandaging,Compression hosiery,CT angiogram,Varicose vein surgery,A,"This woman has both venous and arterial disease. The ulcer is most likely arterio-venous in origin and so both need to be assessed before treatment can be initiated. With an ABPI of 0.5 compression is contraindicated as compression could cause further arterial compromise. The CT angiogram is contraindicated due to her CKD, unless absolutely necessary. A duplex is a non-invasive and easy way to assess both venous and arterial disease."
others,164,"A 55-year-old male presents with abdominal swelling, nausea and mild jaundice. He admits to a long history of regular alcohol consumption, drinking two 330ml bottles of lager per day (3% ABV) as well as a 75cl bottle of 12% ABV wine per week. What is this man's weekly alcohol consumption in units (to the nearest unit of alcohol)?",5 units,11 units,13 units,21 units,23 units,E,"To calculate the number of units, you must multiply the % alcohol (ABV) by volume (in millilitres) then divide by 1000. Assuming that you understand the calculation, there are two potential pitfalls in this question. The first is that we have presented the lager consumption as a daily amount (so needs to be multiplied by 7 to calculate the weekly amount). Secondly, we have presented the wine volume in centilitres and this needs to be converted to millilitres to perform the calculation.  The number of units per bottle of lager is 3% x 330ml divided by 1000 = 0.99unit rounded up to 1 unit. Two bottles a day = 2 units. This equates to 14 units per week.  To calculate the units per bottle of wine: 12% x 750 ml divided by 1000 = 9 units. He has one bottle a week so that's 9 units a week of wine.  Therefore, the total amount of units consumed per week = 14 andamp; 9 = 23 units per week. It is very unlikely that, in an exam setting, you would be presented with so many pitfalls in one question but we have presented this question in this way to highlight these issues so that you a prepared.  Check the units of volume Check the duration  You may have to convert to millilitres or you may need to adjust from daily to weekly and, having done this question and knowing this simple calculation, you will be prepared for anything that the college can throw at you! The UK recommendations are for no more than 14 units for both sexes, per week. Finally, candidates HAVE been asked to calculate units of alcohol in the past. These will be a simple mathematical calculation and our aim is to fully prep you for any eventuality. "
others,165,"A 55-year-old woman presents with a non-pruritic rash that had developed over the last two months. Examination revealed several circular, erythematous, raised bordered, smooth-surfaced lesions of variable size from 1-5 cm in diameter on the elbows, extensor aspects of the forearms and knuckles. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Eczema,Granuloma annulare,Psoriasis,Tinea corporis,Urticaria,B,"The history of non-itchy, circular, raised, smooth-surfaced lesions on the elbows, extensor aspects of the forearms and knuckles and the raised borders are suggestive of granuloma annulare. Discoid eczema tends to be scaly and pruritic in nature. Psoriasis typically has a silvery scale and can be pruritic. Urticaria lasts a few hours and is pruritic. Tinea corporis is a fungal infection and is typically scaly and pruritic in nature. The most likely answer is therefore granuloma annulare. This can be associated with diabetes."

How would you help him?,Acamprosate,Refer to clinical psychologist,Refer to GP,Despiramine,Refer to community mental health support group.,A,If the patient stop alcohol without any supportive treatment there will occur withdrawal symptoms. For the presented situation Acamprosate can help by stopping alcohol without producing withdrawal symtoms (by restoring brain chemical derangement caused by alcohol which is responsible for withdrawal symptoms)
others,167,"A 56-year-old gentleman presents to Aandamp;E with a 12-hour history of severe lower back pain. He describes this as a deep ache which radiates to his lower abdomen. He also reports a cold feeling in his legs, and on direct questioning reports some urinary hesitancy. His wife mentions that he has mentioned less severe back pain on numerous occasions over the last couple of months, and also that he has tripped a few times when walking in the last couple of weeks. On examination hip flexion power is slightly reduced at 4/5 bilaterally, but this appears to be limited by pain rather than true muscular weakness. Although he can feel light touch on both lower limbs he reports it feels different compared to the same touch on his chest. Abdominal examination is normal. Of the options listed below, which is the most likely diagnosis?",Metastatic cauda equina compression,Osteoarthritis of the spine,Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,Pancreatitis,Pyelonephritis,A,"Acute back pain is common and is often associated with relatively benign musculoskeletal conditions. However, several emergency conditions can also present with acute back pain and it is critical to exclude these as possible diagnoses. These conditions include abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), pancreatitis, thoracic aneurysms, pulmonary emboli, pyelonephritis and significant musculoskeletal conditions such as disc prolapse or cauda equina syndrome. This gentleman has several red flag symptoms which mean that cauda equina compression needs to be excluded. He has escalating back pain, which appears radicular in nature, with evidence of sphincter disturbance, lower limb weakness and gait disturbance (resulting in falls). The cauda equina is formed by nerve roots distal to the level of spinal cord termination, which is usually at L1/2. Compression of these nerve roots results in cauda equina syndrome, which classically includes bladder dysfunction (usually retention), loss of anal sphincter tone, saddle anaesthesia and lower limb weakness. Compression can occur due to trauma, disc herniation, tumour or abscesses. Metastatic cauda equina compression (or cord compression) is unfortunately not infrequently the first presentation of malignancy. Its diagnosis is often preceded by a relatively long history of back pain, which becomes progressively more severe. This may be radicular, i.e. radiating along the course of the nerve root. Significant lower limb weakness is a late sign, and patients reporting unsteadiness and frequent falls is often a sign that they have subtle weakness which can be difficult to elicit in the neurological examination. Management of suspected metastatic cauda equina compression should be with urgent commencement of dexamethasone (16mg STAT with a PPI followed by 8mg BD) and an urgent whole spine MRI (which should be completed within 24 hours). Whole spine MRI must always be done, as the level of compression corresponds poorly to examination findings, and it is critical to determine if there are additional lesions at different levels. If metastatic cauda equina compression is confirmed, surgery is the treatment which has been shown to result in the best long-term function in the majority of cases (excluding some very chemosensitive tumours such as lymphoma). However, patients must be fit enough with a long enough prognosis to benefit and recover from the surgery. In this case it would be critical to urgently determine the primary tumour with a CT CAP. Histology could then be sent from surgery if this is still appropriate. Cases which are deemed unsuitable for surgery are treated with radiotherapy. If this gentleman had a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, you would expect him to look acutely unwell with cardiovascular compromise. Classically the pain is felt in the flank or back, and is associated with significant hypotension and a pulsatile abdominal mass. Pyelonephritis typically results in flank pain with associated dysuria. The patient is also classically febrile and tachycardic. Osteoarthritis of the spine is common and results in back pain, which can be radicular in nature. However, the presence of red flag symptoms in this case means that a more serious diagnosis needs to be excluded first. The pain of pancreatitis can be very severe, but is usually felt in the epigastric region and radiates through to the back."
others,168,"A 56-year-old man with severe brain damage is apnoeic, unsedated, and temperature 36.9°C. He is intubated and ventilated. His biochemistry is normal. The combination of which of the following specialists would be able to confirm brain stem death?",Consultant/specialist trainee with one years experience,Consultant/specialist trainee with three years experience,Consultant/specialist trainee with four years experience,Consultant/specialist trainee with five years experience,Consultant/specialist trainee with two years experience,D,"The conventional criteria previously established for clinical death were based upon lack of cardiorespiratory function. The development of organ transplantation highlighted patients who had conditions incompatible with life, but who continued to have some form of cardiorespiratory function with artificial support. This led to a code of practice for the diagnosis of brain stem death. This is based on the knowledge that when the brain stem is damaged to such a degree that its functions are irreversibly destroyed, the heart will inevitably stop beating shortly afterwards. When this occurs, therefore, the patient is dead even though respiration and circulation can be artificially maintained. Brain stem function is checked through set criteria, and the findings must be agreed by at least two senior doctors. One should be a consultant, and the other must have at least five years post registration who has experience in the testing of brain stem death. Life support should be withdrawn at this point, but consideration should be taken as to whether the person would be a suitable organ donor. "
others,169,A 57 year old male presents to his GP with a sudden onset severe frontal headache associated with nausea and vomiting. He also had pain in his right eye and was complaining of visual blurring. On examination there is no evidence of neck stiffness or focal neurology. The right eye appears red with a ciliary flush and a non reactive mid dilated pupil. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Meningitis,Scleritis,Acute Closed Angle Glaucoma,Conjunctivitis,Anterior Uveitis,C,"The key to the diagnosis here is the clinical findings which are inkeeping with a diagnosis of acute glaucoma. Often these patients present with headache and systemic features. In acute angle closure glaucoma there is blockage of the drainage of aqueous fluid resulting in a raised intraocular pressure. Intravenous Acetazolamide should be commenced immediately and an immediate referral made to ophthalmology. Topical beta blocker, steroids, apraclonidine and pilocarpine should also be administered. The patient often requires systemic analgesia and antiemetics. Surgical treatment is the definitive management."
others,170,A 58-year-old female four hours post total thyroidectomy has developed acute shortness of breath. On examination the patient is visibly distressed and has stridor. Removing the dressings reveals a large haematoma deep to the wound. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?,Cricothyroidotomy,Immediate endotracheal intubation,Immediate removal of the skin clips and deep sutures at the bedside,Supplementary oxygen through a mask,Washout of haematoma in theatre,C,"An unrecognised or rapidly expanding haematoma can cause airway compromise and asphyxiation. The immediate management of stridor following thyroidectomy requires the immediate removal of the skin clips and sutures to relieve pressure on the trachea. Failure to take immediate action will result in tracheal occlusion and death. Delays in getting patients to theatre may result in an avoidable death. Following the opening of the neck on the ward the patient should be transferred to the operating theatre for a thorough examination of the neck and meticulous control of bleeding before closing the neck wound. Post-thyroidectomy bleeds are more likely to result in airway compromise as it is midline. Traditionally the skin was closed with a prolene on a bead, so in the event of bleeding one end could be cut and the suture pulled from the other end. The clot is usually found deep to the skin rather than deep to the muscle. Carotid bleeds should not be opened in the ward as there is a potential that it is bleeding from the anastomosis; these require an immediate return to theatre. This is why most units keep the patient in recovery for four hours following the procedure."

Which of the following is correct regarding soft tissue coverage and tissue transfer?",Composite grafts maintain their own blood supply,Free flaps cannot survive based on a pedicle less than 3 mm in diameter,The donor site of a full-thickness skin graft is usually left to heal by secondary intention,The 'take' of a skin graft is independent on the vascularity of the recipient site,V-Y plasty (flap) is a form of advancement flap,E,"Composite grafts, like skin grafts, depend on blood supply from the recipient site. Arteries up to 1 mm in diameter can be successfully anastamosed using microsurgical techniques. Local skin flaps are of two types: flaps that rotate about a pivot point (rotation, transposition, and interpolation flaps) and advancement flaps (single-pedicle advancement, Y-V advancement, V-Y advancement, and bipedicle advancement flaps). The donor site of a split or partial thickness skin graft is left to heal by secondary intention. On the contrary, the donor site of a full-thickness graft requires closure. The success of skin grafting, or 'take', depends on the ability of the graft to receive nutrients and subsequently vascular ingrowth from the recipient site."
others,174,A 59-year-old patient of South Asian origin presents with a widespread blistering rash. Which of the following features would be consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus?,Acanthosis,Blisters arising within the subepidermal area,IgA antibodies,Oral involvement,Treatment with methotrexate,D,"Pemphigus is associated with loss of intercellular cohesion in the lower part of the epidermis, leading to acantholysis (separation of keratinocytes), not acanthosis. Pemphigus is classically associated with flaccid blistering, and often with immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies. Treatment may be successful with azathioprine. Pemphigoid is associated with subepidermal bullae."
others,175,A 5-year-old boy was brought in with crops of asymptomatic rash over the trunk of two months' duration. Examination revealed skin coloured to pearly white and hemispherical to umbilicated papular lesions. Each one is approximately 4 mm in diameter and there are approximately 20 of these lesions present. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Cutaneous cryptococcosis,Folliculitis,Herpes simplex,Molluscum contagiosum,Warts,D,"The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is obvious when a child presents with pearly white hemispherical lesions particularly if they are umbilicated over limbs, trunk or face in various stages of evolution. HIV positive patients may present with cryptococcosis. Cryptococcus neoformans infection affects 5-10% of patients with AIDS in the UK and USA and 30-40% in Africa. Up to 20% of patients with disseminated disease may have skin involvement. In HIV/AIDS cryptococcal skin involvement should be suspected when papulonodular necrotising skin lesions with central umbilication, like molluscum contagiosum are encountered in such patients along with pulmonary or neurological disease. Hence cutaneous cryptococcosis must be kept as a differential in a case of umbilicated lesions on the skin. Folliculitis presents with painful papulopustular follicular lesions. Herpes simplex infection presents with recurrent grouped vesicular eruptions on an erythematous base at mucocutaneous junctions. Warts present with verrucous plaques and papules more commonly over extremities."
others,176,"A 60 year old man presents with sudden painless sight loss in his left eye when he woke that morning. On examination,  visual acuity is normal in the right eye and decreased in the left. A marked afferent papillary defect is seen. Fundoscopy shows retinal haemorrhages globally, dilated tortuous retinal veins, cotton wool spots and macular oedema. The right eye is normal. The patient has no history to note, is not on any medication, but his blood pressure at examination was 190/110 and a blood sugar of 13.1 mmol/L. What has caused the sight loss?",Hypertensive retinopathy,Branch retinal vein occlusion,Ocular ischaemic syndrome,Diabetic retinopathy,Central retinal vein occlusion,E,"Central retinal vein occlusion commonly presents as painless unilateral loss of vision. Fundoscopy reveals diffuse retinal haemorrhages, dilated tortuous retinal veins, cotton wool spots and macular oedema. It is rarely seen in those under 50 years old and is associated with hypertension. Branch retinal vein occlusion have similar signs on fundoscopy but limited to a quadrant supplied by a single vein, and the symptoms of either a scotoma (discrete area of sight loss) or visual blurring is confined to one area of the eyes field of vision. Hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy are bilateral and ocular ischaemic syndrome typically presents with a history of previous episodes of amaurosis fugax (monocular sight loss lasting less than 10 minutes), pain and ongoing loss of vision."
others,177,"A 60-year-old male is brought to the Emergency Department in the early hours of the morning after being found unconscious in the street. On examination, he was drowsy but localised to painful stimuli. There was no evidence of head injury or meningism.

He has a normal acid base balance, slight hyponatraemia reflecting dilution, and very high osmolality reflecting the presence of ethanol. Methanol would produce an acidosis. Diazepam is not an osmolyte nor would the other agents produce this picture. Phenobarbitone poisoning would normally lead to a metabolic acidosis.  Phenytoin poisoning would lead to ataxia, nystagmus and hyperglycaemia."
others,178,A 60-year-old man presents with an acute red eye. Of the following conditions which is the most likely cause?,Closed angle glaucoma,Optic neuritis,Retinal detachment,Retinal vein occlusion,Vitreous haemorrhage,A,"Of those listed the most likely to present with an acute red eye would be glaucoma. Other causes of acute red eye include:  anterior uveitis corneal ulcers conjunctivitis scleritis and episcleritis, and subconjunctival haemorrhage.  Optic neuritis presents with a particular type of central visual loss - a central scotoma. Retinal vein occlusion, retinal detachment and vitreous haemorrhage would present as visual loss or disturbance."
others,179,"A 60-year-old woman presents with raised, erythematous lesions on the limbs and blistering in the mouth and eyes. She had been taking a number of drugs prescribed by her GP. Which may be responsible for her presentation?",Nifedipine,Paracetamol,Paroxetine,Prednisolone ,Sulfasalazine,E,"This is a typical case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is an immune-complex-mediated hypersensitivity complex that is a severe expression of erythema multiforme. SJS typically involves the skin and the mucous membranes. While minor presentations may occur, significant involvement of:  oral nasal eye vaginal urethral gastrointestinal (GI), and lower respiratory tract mucous membranes  may develop in the course of the illness. GI and respiratory involvement may progress to necrosis. SJS is a serious systemic disorder with the potential for severe morbidity and even death. The drugs most closely associated with causing Stevens-Johnson syndrome are:  antibacterials sulfonamides anticonvulsants (oxicam) non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents (piroxicam and tenoxicam) chlormezanone, and  allopurinol."
others,180,A 61-year-old emmetropic female nurse presented with a three day history of missing steps when walking down the stairs as she was seeing double of each of the steps. She reported no such problems when walking up the stairs. She admitted to bumping her head moderately hard when trying to get out of her car four days ago. She denied any deterioration of her visual acuity. No horizontal diplopia was elicited. What is the most likely cause of her problems?,Right inferior oblique palsy,Right inferior rectus palsy,Right superior oblique palsy,Right superior rectus palsy,This patient needs glasses for distance,C,This patient essentially suffered from vertical diplopia following bumping her head moderately hard. Head trauma (including minor head injuries) can result in a trochlear nerve palsy as it is compressed against the tentorial edge or along another part of the pathway. The fourth cranial nerve can be affected in such a situation resulting in superior oblique palsy.

Which of the following medications is most likely to be responsible for his presentation?",Amlodipine,Atenolol,Bendroflumethiazide,Doxazosin,Ramipril,E,"This man has presented with anaphylaxis. Whilst angio-oedema may be hereditary or idiopathic, it is also associated with use of both ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). Given that he has recently increased his anti-hypertensive medication, presentation with angio-oedema associated with ACE inhibitor therapy seems the most likely explanation. He should cease ramipril therapy and not commence either ACE inhibitors or ARBs in the future. "

Those most commonly involved include penicillins, cephalosporins, vancomycin, NSAIDs, thiazides and furosemide. Interstitial nephritis usually develops within 2-60 days of treatment with a beta-lactam, and presents with haematuria, acute kidney injury, and fever. A maculopapular rash and hepatic involvement can also occur. Interstitial nephritis associated with NSAIDs is most commonly seen in elderly patients who have taken non-steroidals intermittently for months to years. Proteinuria is dominant, and the nephrotic syndrome can develop. Ultrasound scanning is generally recommended in all cases of acute kidney injury, to exclude renal tract obstruction. In interstitial nephritis, renal size is usually normal and there may be some increased cortical echogenicity. A definite diagnosis can only be made with renal biopsy, which usually shows mononuclear cell infiltrate throughout the interstitium with associated oedema. The mainstay of treatment is to withdraw any drug which may be causative. High-dose prednisolone is indicated in some cases to hasten recovery. Dialysis may be required in severe cases."

This patient needs to be fully assessed, admitted and undergo upper endoscopy within 24 hours according to current guidelines.^1,2 Endoscopy and sclerotherapy or band ligation can be used for secondary prophylaxis of oesophageal variceal haemorrhage, although band ligation has a lower rebleeding and complication rate and so is the recommended technique. Terlipressin and antibiotics should be started preendoscopy to all patients suspected of variceal haemorrhage. Post endosopic variceal treatment should be followed by vasoactive pharmacotherpay with terlipressin, octreotide or high dose somatostatin for up to five days (72 hours for terlipressin). A Sengstaken-Blakemore tube may stop bleeding through compression and should be used as salvage treatment for uncontrolled variceal bleeding before definitive management with TIPS. "
others,186,"A 63-year-old man was found collapsed. A department of psychiatry outpatient card was found in his jacket, together with a bottle of procyclidine tablets.

NMS is characterised by:  Fever Muscular rigidity Altered mental status Autonomic dysfunction.  Procyclidine is used to treat the Parkinsonian side effects of neuroleptics; its presence in the patient's pocket implies that he was taking neuroleptics. Signs of procyclidine overdose include:  Agitation Confusion Sleeplessness lasting up to 24 hours or more Pupils are dilated and unreactive to light.  Visual and auditory hallucinations and tachycardia have also been reported. 
others,187,"A 63-year-old smoker has been investigated for a cough and chest pain and a diagnosis of bronchial carcinoma is made on a plain chest x ray examination. Before a tissue diagnosis can be made, he dies in hospital of a large and unexpected haemoptysis and a post mortem examination is carried out with the consent of the relatives. At this examination, the correct diagnosis is shown to be tuberculosis and there is no carcinoma. In these circumstances, is it mandatory to make a report to a particular authority, and if so, which?",Consultant in Communicable Diseases Control,Coroner,General Medical Council,Health and Safety Executive,Strategic Health Authority,A,"The correct answer is the Consultant in Communicable Disease Control. The rationale behind reporting is to facilitate control of the spread of diseases. The other four authorities listed above do not have this as their primary role. Public Health England outlines reporting procedures as follows:  andquot;Doctors in England and Wales have a statutory duty to notify a 'Proper Officer' of the Local Authority or local Health Protection Unit (HPU) of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases. The attending Registered Medical Practitioner should fill out a notification certificate immediately on diagnosis of a suspected notifiable disease and should not wait for laboratory confirmation of the suspected infection or contamination before notification. The certificate should be sent to the Proper Officer within three days or verbally within 24 hours if the case is considered urgent.andquot;  The Proper Officer is usually the local Consultant in Communicable Disease Control, but if in doubt, details of the local HPU can be found on the Public Health England website.

others,188,A 64 year old male presents with a sudden onset of central vision disturbance. On fundoscopy there is evidence of very small discrete yellow deposits and pale mottled areas. There also appears to be a small focal pale pink yellow elevation at the macula. Which of the following investigations should be performed which will confirm the diagnosis and aid in deciding the management?,Slit lamp examination,Retinal photography,MRI of eye,Fundus fluorescein angiography,Optical coherence tomography,D,The most likely diagnosis is wet age related macular degeneration as there is evidence of drusen and atrophy. The pale pink elevation suggests a neovascular membrane indicated wet age related macular degeneration. Fluorescein angiography will confirm the presence of a neovascular membrane and the results are utilised in assessing if ablation is likely to be effective. Retinal photography may aid in the diagnosis but angioography is required to guide management. Optical coherence tomography is also useful for the diagnosis however in wet ARMD then angiography is still required to guide management.
others,189,A 65 year old female present with a blistering itchy rash. On examination there was evidence of tense blisters on her thigh and trunk and some small vesicles. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Bullous pemphigoid,Photosensitivity,Pemphigus Vulgaris,Eczema Herpeticum,B,The most likely diagnosis is Bullous pemphigoid due to the history. This is not the pattern of blistering observed in dermatitis herpetiformis which affects extensor surfaces.
others,190,"A 65-year-old female who has a history of long-standing psoriasis and heavy alcohol intake, presents with a severe exacerbation of psoriasis. She was admitted and received topical therapy and over the month of her admission, her gamma-GT concentration had fallen from 400 U/L to 150 U/L (4-35). Six weeks after discharge she was seen in outpatients where her psoriasis remained under control, but she complained of generalised hair loss. Which is the most likely cause for her hair loss?",Alopecia areata,Iron deficiency,Telogen effluvium,Thiamine deficiency,Trichotillomania,C,"In a normal healthy person's scalp, about 85% of the hair follicles are actively growing hair and 15% are resting. If there is some shock to the system, as many as 70% of the scalp hairs can be precipitated into a resting state, thus reversing the usual ratio. Typical precipitants include illnesses, operations, accidents, and childbirth. The resting scalp hairs, now in the form of club hairs, remain firmly attached to the hair follicles at first. It is only about two months after the shock that the new hairs coming up through the scalp push out the 'dead' club hairs and increased hair fall is noticed. Thus, paradoxically, with this type of hair loss, hair fall is a sign of hair regrowth. As the new hair first comes up through the scalp and pushes out the dead hair a fine fringe of new hair is often evident along the forehead hairline. At first, the fall of club hairs is profuse and a general thinning of the scalp hair may become evident but after several months a peak is reached and hair fall begins to lessen, gradually tapering back to normal over six to nine months. As the hair fall tapers off, the scalp thickens back up to normal, but recovery may be incomplete in some cases."
others,191,"A 65-year-old hypermetropic lady was seen in an acute unselected medical take. She presented with a three hour history of dull pain, lacrimation, photophobia and reduced vision in the right eye. She had no significant past medical history. Ocular examination revealed a painful red eye with an oval shaped pupil. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute angle closure glaucoma,Episcleritis,Iritis,Keratoconjunctivitis,Scleritis,A,"Red eye of an acute painful dull nature, with photophobia and reduced vision in a hypermetropic person is highly indicative of acute angle closure glaucoma. The pupil in this condition is usually mid-dilated oval shaped. The oval shape is due to the iris sphincter ischaemia from the high intraocular pressure. Episcleritis does not usually cause pain or effect the pupil The same goes for iritis in respect to pupilary changes.  Keratoconjunctivitis is inflammation of the cornea and conjuctiva."

Amyloid plaques are characteristic in Alzheimer's dementia. Cerebral arterial atherosclerosis usually leads to small vessel disease and multi-infarct dementia. Cytoplasmic inclusion bodies are characteristically found in multi-system atrophy (MSA). Neuronal inclusion bodies are found in Pick's disease and frontotemporal dementia. "
others,196,A 65-year-old man with hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia is admitted with right sided weakness. He has marked receptive dysphasia. Examination reveals right sided facial weakness as well as right-sided hemiparesis. Sensation on the right side of the body is also impaired. The presence of which additional finding would suggest a diagnosis of a left total anterior circulation infarct (L TACI) rather than a left partial anterior circulation infarct (L PACI)?,Bitemporal hemianopia,Left homonomous hemianopia,Left sided visual neglect,Right homonomous hemianopia,Right sided visual neglect,D,"A bitemporal hemianopia is caused by a lesion of the optic chiasm. Right homonymous hemianopia is the correct answer. A TACI comprises of all three of the following:  higher cortical dysfunction which includes visuospatial disturbance (in this case visuospatial neglect), dysphasia, and/or a decreased level of consciousness contralateral homonymous hemianopia, and motor and sensory deficits in two or more of the contralateral face/arm/leg.  Left sided visual neglect may be present in this patient (as part of the higher cortical dysfunction), but a contralateral homonymous hemianopsia must be present to fulfil the criteria for a TACI. It is important to note that a patient may have normal visual fields, but may still have left-sided visual neglect. A right TACI would cause a left homonymous hemianopia and not a right homonymous hemianopia. "

others,199,"A 67-year-old male is admitted with central chest pain of sudden onset which radiates through to his back. His blood pressure is 160/70 mmHg in his right arm and 140/60 mmHg in his left arm. He has electrocardiographic (ECG) changes in leads II, III, and AVF showing ST elevation of 2 mm. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Coarctation of the aorta,Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm,Inferior myocardial infarct,Pancreatitis,Perforated duodenal ulcer,B,"This history is suggestive of a dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm. The ECG changes of inferior myocardial infarct suggest that the aneurysm has dissected the right coronary artery at its ascending aortic ostium. An ascending aortic dissection needs immediate surgery. Whilst en route to surgery, beta blockade to control hypertension is appropriate. An inferior myocardial infarct is high in the differential, however thrombolysis will kill a patient with an aortic dissection. Coarctation can give different blood pressures in either arm but is a chronic condition. Ulcer and pancreatitis may mimic a heart attack, but with a normal ECG."
others,200,"A 67-year-old man is three days post sigmoid colectomy. He has insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. He has dizziness, upper abdominal discomfort and faintness.

His electrocardiogram shows ST depression of 2 mm in leads II, III and AVF. Which is the most appropriate initial drug therapy?",Aspirin 300 mg,Clexane 1 mg/kg subcutaneously,Clopidogrel 75 mg,Diamorphine 2.5 mg,Glycerol trinitrate 800 mcg sublingually,A,"Initial treatment of an acute coronary syndrome is aspirin 300 mg. This should be safe in the postoperative patient with no signs of bleeding at three days post operation. Clexane would have also been given pre- and post-op. The dose of clopidogrel is 300 mg in an acute coronary syndrome. Diamorphine is used to treat anxiety and pain, neither of which is commented upon. GTN would be reasonable to try, however, the blood pressure is low. Remember that, in the diabetic, chest pain may not be a feature of acute coronary syndrome due to autonomic dysfunction, and in most post surgical patients myocardial infarction is silent."
others,201,A 68 year old femalee presents with central visual blurring. On examination there appears to be small yellow deposits within the maculae and a small haemorrhage at the maculae.  Fluoroscein angiography is performed and shows neovascularisation within the macula of both eyes.  You suspect wet age related macular degeneration.  Which of the following is an important risk factor for the development?,Cataract surgery,Hypertension,Smoking,Diabetes,Glaucoma,C,Smoking is the greatest risk factor for the development of age related macular degeneration.  Hypertension and cataract surgery have also been implicated.  Macular degeneration is whereby neovascularisation and haemorrhage has occurred in the area of the macula.  Laser therapy has been utilised in the management and there is now a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapies which have been shown to have benefit in age related macular degeneration.
others,202,"A 68 year old gentleman presents with a red, swollen, warm, hardened area of skin which is well demarcated and has a raised border. He is generally unwell with a fever. What organism is most likely responsible?",Herpes Simplex Virus,Streptococcus Pyogenes,Group B haemolytic streptococcus,Staph. Epidermidis,Staphylococcus Aureus,B,The diagnosis is erysipelas. The most common causative agent is Strep. pyogenes or also known as group A beta haemolytic strep. Other non A haemolytic strep can be causative.
others,203,A 68 year old male with previous history of TIA presents with unilateral painless vision loss. The retina is pale and the macula appears as a cherry red spot. What is the most likely cause of the vision loss?,Retinal detachment,Retinal vein occlusion,Age related macular degeneration,Central retinal artery occlusion,Vitreous haemorrhage,D,The history of previous TIA and finding of pale retina with a cherry red spot is characteristic of central retinal artery occlusion. Retinal vein occlusion presents similarly however there is evidence of flame haemorrhages. Similarly retinal detachment and vitreous haemorrhage can present in this fashion however the fundoscopy results would differ.
others,204,A 68-year-old female attends the falls clinic. She had multiple falls over the last six months and she has noticed that she has become much more unsteady on her feet. Her husband tells you that she has become very restless at night and that he hardly gets any sleep. Examination reveals bradykinesia and a jerky rest tremor. Her gait is broad based. She scores 28/30 on a mini-mental state examination (MMSE). Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Corticobasal degeneration (CBD),Idiopathic Parkinson's disease,Multiple system atrophy (MSA),Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP),Vascular parkinsonism,C,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease. The above patient fulfils the criteria for a parkinsonian syndrome (and probably has rapid eye movement sleep disorder), but there are a number of red flags alluding to a Parkinson's plus syndrome:  the patient has multiple falls early in the disease she has cerebellar signs - broad based (ataxic) gait she has a 'jerky' tremor.  Corticobasal degeneration presents with parkinsonism, but also cognitive impairment (MMSE here is normal). CBD presents with apraxia and this is responsible for the gait disturbance - it does not present with cerebellar signs as it affects the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia. Idiopathic Parkinson's disease does not present with early falls or early postural instability. This feature usually presents late in the course of the disease. It also does not present with cerebellar signs. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) does present with early falls (usually backwards) but does not present with cerebellar signs. The gait in vascular parkinsonism is usually shuffly with short step length and not ataxic. Rest tremor is absent in vascular parkinsonism, but postural tremor may occur."
others,205,"A 68-year-old female patient is seen on the ward. She complains of severe pain in her right eye. There is blurring of vision and she feels nauseated and has vomited several times. Earlier in the day, she has undergone colonoscopy for evaluation of her longstanding Crohn's disease. The endoscopist has made a comment that the examination was difficult and that hyoscine butyl bromide (Buscopan) was administered. What is the likely cause of her painful eye?",Acute angle closure glaucoma,Acute conjunctivitis,Anterior uveitis,Episcleritis,Sub-conjunctival haemorrhage,A,"Antimuscarinic (previously called anticholinergic) agents are sometimes used during endoscopy to cause smooth muscle relaxation to aid examination when a difficulty is encountered. These agents cause pupillary dilatation, so can precipitate acute angle closure glaucoma in susceptible patients. In patients with a history of glaucoma, glucagon is used instead of anticholinergics."
others,206,"A 68-year-old gentleman is brought to Aandamp;E by ambulance having been found collapsed on the street. He has no recollection of the incident. A friend who was with him at the time said he suddenly fell to the floor without warning, looked pale and remained unresponsive for around 30 seconds. He then immediately came back to normal. He does not remember seeing any arm or leg twitching, and there has not been any incontinence of urine. Examination of the patient is normal apart from a swollen lump with overlying bruise on the back of his head. HR is 84, BP 149/84, SaO2 98% OA, RR 14. What is the most appropriate investigation to determine the underlying cause of this gentleman's collapse?",CT brain,Echocardiogram,MRI brain,Tilt table,24h ECG monitoring,E,"When assessing a patient with collapse, multiple causes must be considered including neurological and cardiac conditions. The history can be very suggestive of the underlying cause, particularly if obvious seizure activity has occurred. However, tonic-clonic activity, incontinence, and tongue biting can also occur if a period of cerebral anoxia has occurred secondary to syncope. The focus of investigation of patients presenting with collapse should be appropriate brain imaging, cardiac arrhythmia investigations, and biochemical checks. Many drugs can cause collapse, especially in the case of polypharmacy, and it is important that the patient's medication history is also reviewed. In this gentleman's case, the sudden collapse without warning and rapid recovery point to a possible cardiac cause. A 12-lead ECG would obviously be critical but is often normal following the period of collapse. 24h tape monitoring and loop recording should be undertaken in this gentleman as an inpatient and has good sensitivity at detecting arrhythmias. It is possible, however, that no abnormalities are demonstrated during the monitoring period, which might warrant more prolonged investigation. CT brain may be warranted in this case to exclude the possibility of head injury secondary to the collapse, but any abnormality detected is likely to be secondary to the collapse rather than the cause. Intracranial pathology can result in collapse, but usually in the form of a seizure, and CT brain would be indicated in those patients to determine the underlying cause. MRI is more sensitive at detecting subtle intracerebral lesions compared to CT. Tilt table testing can be very useful in determining the underlying cause of collapse. It aims to determine whether underlying autonomic dysfunction (e.g. postural orthostatic tachycardia, vasodepressor syncope, vasovagal syncope) was the cause of the patient's collapse. It is indicated in patients who have symptoms such as unexplained hypotension, tachycardia present on standing and orthostatic palpitations. These patients often have a clear pre-syncopal syndrome, which is not present in this case. ECG monitoring is generally considered prior to tilt table testing, especially in cases such as this where the history is more classic for cardiac syncope. "
others,207,"A 68-year-old man presents for a follow-up visit in clinic. He presented six months ago with short-term memory loss, loss of verbal fluency and dysphasia. His wife then reported that he has become 'less tolerant' and 'overreacts'. Examination at that point was normal and he scored 25/30 on the mini-mental state examination. A CT brain was essentially normal. Full blood count, biochemical tests, thyroid function, B12 and folate were all normal. He scored 19/30 on a repeat MMSE today. He is diagnosed as having probable Alzheimer's disease and is commenced on donepezil. The drug acts by inhibiting which of the following enzymes?",Catechol-O-methyl transferase,Cholinesterase,Dopamine decarboxylase,Glutamic acid decarboxylase,Monoamine oxidase,B,"Donepezil is a cholinesterase inhibitor. It increases acetylcholine levels in the brain and has been shown to slow progression of Alzheimer's dementia. Catechol-O-methyl transferase is responsible for degradation of dopamine, adrenaline and noradrenaline and catechol-O-methyl transferase inhibitors are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Dopamine decarboxylase degrades dopamine and dopa decarboxylase inhibitors are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Glutamic acid decarboxylase is responsible for converting glutamic acid into gamma-aminobutyric acid which is an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Inhibition of this enzyme is likely to give rise to uncontrollable movements such as chorea. Monoamine oxidase breaks down most cerebral neurotransmitters. Monoamine oxidase inhibitors can be used in the treatment of depression. "
others,208,A 68-year-old woman admitted for a total hip replacement develops signs of a urinary tract infection on the third post operative day. Microscopy confirms the presence of Escherichia coli. Which of the following antibiotics has the lowest expected effectiveness for this nosocomial acquired infection?,Ampicillin,Cefuroxime,Ciprofloxacin,Co-amoxiclav,Gentamicin,A,"Escherichia coli is a Gram negative bacillus which produces penicillinases, but it remains sensitive to numerous antibiotics. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major problem and where possible sensitivities should be checked before blind treatment of infections is commenced. Ampicillin (and amoxicillin) are broad spectrum antibiotics active against non-beta lactamase producing Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. They are inactivated by penicillinases. Since up to 50% of Escherichia coli strains are now resistant they have the lowest expected effectiveness in this list. Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin that is resistant to inactivation by bacterial beta-lactamases and so may be used against Escherichia coli. Ciprofloxacin has a 6-fluoro substituent which confers enhanced antibacterial potency against both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms, including Escherichia coli. Co-amoxiclav consists of amoxicillin and the beta-lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. Thus it is active against beta-lactamase producing bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin, including strains of Escherichia coli. Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside which works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit; this inhibits the translocation of the peptidyl-tRNA from the A-site to the P-site and also causes misreading of mRNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesise proteins vital to its growth."

Progression of tumour causes otalgia which is an ominous sign. Conjunctival pallor is due to tumour related anemia
others,210,A 68-year-old woman presents with a two month history of a widespread pruritic rash. Examination reveals widespread erythema with several small blisters containing straw-coloured fluid and one or two larger serosanguineous blisters. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bullous impetigo ,Bullous pemphigoid,Insect bite,Scabies,Urticarial vasculitis,B,"Pemphigoid, erythema multiforme, and herpes are the commonest causes of a blistering rash. The history above is a classic description of bullous pemphigoid (BP). Immunoglobulin (Ig)G autoantibodies bind to the skin basement membrane in patients with BP. The binding of antibodies at the basement membrane activates complement and inflammatory mediators. Activation of the complement system is thought to play a critical role in attracting inflammatory cells to the basement membrane. These inflammatory cells are postulated to release proteases, which degrade hemidesmosomal proteins and lead to blister formation. Eosinophils are characteristically present in blisters as demonstrated by histopathologic analysis, although their presence is not an absolute diagnostic criterion."
others,211,"A 69-year-old gentleman presents to his GP with hoarseness of voice of three months' duration.

In addition, the larynx and vocal cords also appear red and beefy. Choose the single most appropriate diagnosis.",Candidiasis of the larynx,Chronic laryngitis,Laryngeal carcinoma,Laryngeal papillomata,Sicca syndrome,A,"Candidiasis of the larynx is common in patients using steroid inhalers. Those at an increased risk include:  Very young or old Diabetics, and Immunosuppressed (cytotoxics, steroids, haematological malignancies, AIDS).  These lesions appear as creamy white patches on the mucosa, surrounded by a thin margin of erythema. Patches are hard to remove and they bleed if scraped. Anti-fungal agents such as nystatin or amphotericin B are useful to treat this condition. If possible, antibiotics should be withdrawn."
others,212,"A 70 year old presents with a lesion on his cheek. The lesion has a raised, pearly border and there is telangiectasia on the surface of the lesion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Wart,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Actinic Keratosis,Melanoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,E,The lesion described is typical of a nodular basal cell carcinoma. These present on sun exposed skin. Superficial BCCs more often present on the body but differ in that instead of telangiectasia they appear scaling black with a pearly white raised border. Excision surgery is the treatment of choice.
others,213,A 70-year-old alcoholic presented with pain in the left hip joint. He had been in good health with his only past medical history being of sudden blindness in the right eye which was treated with high dose steroids. x Ray of the left hip showed severe degeneration of femoral head with loss of joint space. What is the most likely cause of the joint deformity?,Age-related osteoarthritis,Avascular necrosis of the femoral head,Monoarticular rheumatoid arthritis with eye involvement,Perthes' disease,Reactive arthritis,B,"Age-related osteoarthritis is incorrect as osteoarthritis is generally bilateral and x ray changes are osteophytes, subchondral sclerosis and subchondral cyst formation. Rheumatoid arthritis does not cause blindness and the x ray changes include juxta-articular bony erosions, periarticular osteopenia, periarticular soft tissue swelling and joint subluxation. Perthes' disease is a disease of childhood. Reactive arthritis presents more acutely with painful eyes and painful joints. In chronic cases, x ray changes are similar to those of RA."

His wife said over the last three months her husband lost his way back home in the evening three times and was brought back by the neighbours. Choose the appropriate diagnosis from the following list.,Alcoholism,Chronic subdural haematoma,Depression,Dementia,Transient global amnesia,D,"Because the confusion occurred in the evenings, alcoholism is a possibility and should be explored in the history. However, it is not mentioned in the scenario, hence alcoholism is unlikely. Chronic subdural haematoma and depression would present with gradual and persistent change in personality without any recovery. However, chronic subdural haematoma and depression should be excluded in all cases of suspected dementia. Transient global amnesia almost always occurs as a single episode."

She is otherwise well and there is no mucosal involvement. This is typical of bullous pemphigoid. Pemphigus often involves the mucosa with flat pus filled blisters. Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with itchy excoriated areas in the elbows knees and buttocks. Erythema multiforme presents with characteristic target lesions. Herpes simplex is vesicular and in generalised cases the patient is likely to be unwell. Pemphigus presents with superficial erosions and usually there is mucosal involvement."

others,220,"A 71-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes comes to the Emergency Department for review. She has an extensive erythematous skin rash affecting the underside of both breasts and skin folds over her lower abdomen. Despite using topical moisturiser she says the skin is breaking down, is itchy and bleeding. On examination she has a BP of 145/89, pulse is 70 and regular. She is apyrexial. Her BMI is 35. The rash is moist with yellowish adherent plaques and papules around the edges. Routine bloods reveal an elevated glucose and CRP, but are otherwise unremarkable. Her most recent HbA1c is 64 mmol/mol. Which of the following is the most useful intervention for her rash?",Intensified glycaemic control,Oral fluconazole,Topical clotrimazole,Topical hydrocortisone,Topical terbinafine,B,"The answer is oral fluconazole. The presentation here is consistent with candida related intertrigo, as a result of this patient's diabetes and obesity, which leads to skin folds being warm and moist, increasing the chances of fungal infection. The debate is between topical and oral therapy, but given this patient has very extensive infection and a history of diabetes (known to result in relative immunosuppression), oral intervention is preferred to the topical option. In total oral fluconazole can be given for a period of 2-4 weeks. Intensified glycaemic control will be useful in reducing the risk of future infection, but it is highly unlikely to eradicate the current problem, and as such anti-fungal intervention is preferred. Both topical clotrimoxazole and terbinafine are options in patients with more limited infection, and hydrocortisone may be added where there is marked inflammation but is not used as monotherapy."
others,221,A 72 year old female presents to her GP after noticing blisters on her arms and legs. She has recently been commenced on furosemide. On examination there is tense blisters evident predominantly on the flexural surfaces of her arms and legs. There is no evidence of blisters in her mucous membranes. There is some healing areas where the blisters have burst but no evidence of scarring. A skin biopsy is organised and reveals subepidermal blister and inflammatory infiltrate with numerous eosinophils. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pyoderma Gangrenosum,Eczema Herpeticum,Bullous pemphigoid,Pemphigus Vulgaris,Dermatitis herpetiformis,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Bullous pemphigoid which leads to the clinical findings above. In comparison to Pemphigus which often presents the mucous membranes and leads to superficial blisters, easily ruptured and with an intradermal pattern. Furosemide, NSAIDs and ACE inhibitors and penicillamine can lead to the development of pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder which leads to autoantibody formation to hemidesmosome proteins (attach basal cell to basement membrane). This leads to a split between epidermis and dermis and thus tense blister formation. There is no history of eczema and herpes does not cause large tense blisters. Dermatitis herpetiformis is usually on the extensor surfaces and there is often a history of Coeliac."
others,222,"A 72 year old gentleman is referred to the clinic with a lesion on his cheek which has been gradually increasing in size, is raised and has a pearly appearance with an ulcerated centre. What of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Amelanotic melanoma,Wart,Actinic Keratosis,Squamous cell carcinoma,Basal cell carcinoma,E,"The slow growing papule or nodule on a sun exposed area is likely to be a BCC which can cause local erosion but very rarely metastasise. They appear as translucent or pearly lesions and have raised areas with telangiectasia and classically has an ulcerated centre and indurated edge. It can cause significant destruction locally. Squamous cell carcinoma normally presents as an indurated nodular keratinising or crusted lesion that may ulcerate, or may present as an ulcer without keratinisation."

She has been started on dexamethasone 16mg daily.What is the single most likely cause of her weakness?",Paraneoplastic neuropathy,Progression of brain tumor,PID at L2/L3,Spinal cord compression,Steroid induced myopathy,D,Brain metastasis induced cerebral oedema can explain blurring of vision secondary to raised intracranial pressure. Rest of the features including weakness can well explain spinal cord compression
others,226,"A 74-year-old gentleman with no significant past medical history presents to Aandamp;E with palpitations, shortness of breath and malaise. On examination, he has peripheral oedema to his mid calves. ECG shows prominent T-waves throughout. The urine sample he provides is visibly frothy, and has 4+ protein. HR is 110, BP 95/57, SaO2 92% OA, RR 26. Venous blood gas shows pH 7.28, bicarbonate 14 and potassium 7.1. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management step? ",10ml 10% Calcium gluconate IV,10 units Actrapid in 50ml 50% glucose IV,40mg Furosemide IV,100ml of 8.4% Sodium bicarbonate IV,1L 0.9% saline IV over 1 hour,A,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is seen in multiple conditions. Its causes can be divided into pre-renal, renal and post-renal. Key management measures include investigating reversible pathology such as obstruction and drug-induced causes and management of acute biochemical emergencies, in particular, hyperkalaemia where attention must be paid to stabilisation of the myocardium. It is important to also pay attention to the management of fluid overload, which can result in rapid patient deterioration if not addressed. In this case, the patient has a dangerously high potassium with ECG changes and therefore myocardial stabilisation must be the initial step. Calcium gluconate is typically first line for this in the UK, but calcium chloride can also be done. It works within 1-3 minutes, and the effect lasts for 30-60 minutes (allowing time for other measures to reduce the serum potassium). An insulin infusion shifts the potassium intracellularly within 10-30 minutes. The glucose is required to prevent hypoglycaemia, and blood glucose should be monitored closely. This treatment should be started immediately following calcium gluconate in this gentleman's case. IV sodium bicarbonate is sometimes advocated for severe metabolic acidosis, but there is no good randomised controlled evidence for its use. In general, it should not be instigated in the emergency setting without the input of either renal or intensive care physicians. Although this patient is hypotensive, large volumes of fluid can be detrimental in oliguric acute injury and therefore fluids should be given cautiously initially until the cause of the AKI has been carefully considered. This patient is demonstrating signs of fluid overload (peripheral oedema) which may warrant furosemide as part of the management but again this can be detrimental to some cases of AKI and should only be given urgently if the patient has significant pulmonary oedema."
others,227,A 75 year old gentleman with type 2 diabetes melllitus presents for his retinal screening. On the retinal photograph there is evidence of cotton wool spots and flame haemorrhages. There also appears to be new vessel formation very close to the optic disc. What is the next stage in management?,Fenofibrate,Referral for laser photocoagulation,Optimal glycaemic control,Referral for fluorescein angiography,Insulin,B,This patient clearly has proliferative retinopathy as there is evidence of neovascularisation. In those with proliferative retinopathy referral should be made to opthalmology for laser photocoagulation. Laser therapy is aimed at regression of new vessel formation and is thought to work by reducing vasoproliferative mediators secreted by hypoxic vessels. Fluorescein angiography may be utilised for further investigation if there is macular oedema however is not essential in this case. Optimal glycaemic control is always important but once there is evidence of proliferative retinopathy further management is required. Fenofibrate is currently being investigated and may reduce the need for laser treatment however further study is required.
others,228,A 75-year-old female presents with chronic leg ulceration which is a consequence of venous insufficiency. Which one of the following is the most appropriate management?,Appropriate systemic antibiotic in preparation for skin grafting,Compression bandaging,Improve the venous return by limb elevation,Skin biopsy to exclude neoplasm ,Vein surgery exclusion of neoplasm by skin biopsy,B,"Venous ulcers are secondary to venous stasis and chronic stretching of the walls of the superficial veins. These eventually become thinner and ulcerate. The mainstay of treatment of venous ulceration is compression therapy, which aims to improve venous return and thereby reduce venous hypertension.  The patient should always have their Doppler's and ABPI (ankle brachial pressure index) prior to compression. The ABPI should be greater than 1 before compression bandaging is used (this excludes significant arterial disease.  Antibiotics are not indicated unless there are signs of infection.  Limb elevation is not a viable long term solution.  The other two options will not help treat the underlying issue.   "
others,229,A 75-year-old female presents with generalised erythema and pustule formation. She has a history of psoriasis and has recently been treated with oral prednisolone for asthma. Which of the following is the most appropriate next course of action?,Admission to hospital,Patch testing,Psoralen with ultraviolet-A therapy (PUVA),Skin biopsy,Treatment with erythromycin as an outpatient,A,This is erythroderma which is a dermatological emergency. The patient needs admission with close supervision and supportive treatment with IV fluids and antibiotics. Patch testing is used in allergy testing to identify causative agents.  PUVA is used in a number of skin conditions such as psoriasis or eczema.  Skin biopsy is not going to help treat the condition neither is outpatient erythromycin.
others,230,"A 75-year-old man developed a gradual problem of not being able to look up over the last eight months. Then about two months ago, he was also not able to look down. He denied any diplopia, ocular pain or headaches. There was no evidence of convergence retraction nystagmus, or proptosis. Ptosis was evident bilaterally.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia,Ocular myasthenia,Ocular myositis,Parinaud's syndrome,Thyroid eye disease,A,"The history itself suggests a chronic progressive limitation of eye movements. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO). CPEO is an eye movement disorder which is often associated with mitochondrial disease. Although it typically presents in young adults, it can affect all ages. Classically the initial sign is bilateral ptosis, which is often unnoticed by the patient until the lid droops to the point of producing a visual field defect. This can be absent, as in this case. Ophthalmoplegia then develops, which is symmetrical and again therefore unnoticed until ocular motility limits peripheral vision. All directions of gaze are affected, but downward gaze often less so. Weakness of extraocular muscle groups, such as orbicularis oculi and facial muscles, can be present in 25% of patients. Visual acuity is affected in 95% of patients, but the deficit is usually mild. CPEO is diagnosed via muscle biopsy, which shows an accumulation of enlarged mitochrondria. PCR can also determine a mutation of mitochondrial DNA. There are no specific treatments currently, but surgery can be used to correct ptosis and prisms can be used to help with ophthalmoplegia. Ocular myasthenia usually presents with diplopia and ptosis, which the patients notice worsens by the end of the day. Parinaud's syndrome usually manifests as up gaze palsy with convergence retraction nystagmus. Ocular myositis is idiopathic inflammation of one of more of the extraocular muscles, which is associated with acute pain on moving the eye. Although it can be recurrent, the episodes are usually self-limiting and resolve within 6 weeks. Proptosis is often dominant in thyroid eye disease, and there is typically complex diplopia."
others,231,"A 75-year-old man, known to have ischaemic heart disease, with a previous history of alcohol abuse, presented with a one week history of deterioration of central vision in the right eye. He denied any ocular pain or headache. An objective visual fields test was done and he was found to have a right central scotoma. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcohol toxic amblyopia,Macular degeneration,Ocular ischaemic syndrome,Vitamin A deficiency,Vitamin B12 deficiency,B,"This history is most in keeping with macular degeneration. The relatively short history is more suggestive of wet age-related macular degeneration, which is actually a systemic problem, of which ischaemic heart disease is a risk factor. Toxic amblyopia will more often give a centro-caecal scotoma. Central scotoma here indicates that only the macula region is involved. Alcohol toxic amblyopia leads to acute complete blindness.  Ocular ischaemic syndrome symptoms include visual loss, transient visual loss, and ischemic ocular pain. Vitamin B12 deficiency does not normally cause blindness.  Vitamin A deficiency leads to night blindness."

Which additional finding would suggest a diagnosis of essential tremor rather than Parkinson's disease?",Bradykinesia,Primarily kinetic tremor,Primarily postural tremor,Resting tremor,The tremor increases with emotional stress,C,"Primarily postural tremor is correct, as essential tremor is primarily a postural tremor. This describes the characteristic of occurring during maintenance of a posture against gravity. Resting tremor is incorrect, as a resting tremor is associated with Parkinson's disease. This occurs when a body part is at complete rest against gravity. Bradykinesia is incorrect as it is a key feature of Parkinson's disease and not essential tremor. Primarily kinetic tremor is incorrect as this occurs during voluntary movement. The tremor in both Parkinson's disease and essential tremor may worsen with emotional stress. "

When the skull is involved, the patient may report headache, increased hat size and cranial nerve palsies as affected bones enlarge and encroach on the nerve foramina. In this case facial nerve is affected. Serum calcium and phosphate are normal but serum alkaline phosphatase is raised. Bony metastases produce local bone pain while in this patient the symptoms are rather generalised. Cholestasis is the wrong answer as it is usually accompanied by some elevation in liver enzymes and bilirubin.

others,237,"A 78-year-old man is under going circumcision for recurrent balanitis. To achieve haemostasis, you employ bipolar diathermy. Which of the following is correct regarding bipolar diathermy?",Is safe to use on patient fitted with an internal cardiac pacemaker,Is usually used in the cutting mode,Requires the forceps to be held tightly together,Requires the use of a plate,Should never be used on an extremity,A,"Bipolar diathermy avoids the use of a plate. The diathermy current passes down one limb of the forceps and back to the generator via the other limb. In bipolar diathermy the current passes between the tips of the forceps with the heating affect between and therefore safe to use on extremities when used with caution. Bipolar diathermy can only produce coagulation (heating affect between forceps tips). Cutting diathermy involves a continuous arc (spark) between the active electrode and the tissue involved as occurs in monopolar diathermy. A small gap must be maintained between the forceps tips to allow the current to arc between them. Bipolar current will only pass from one tip to the other, therefore not affecting the cardiac pacemaker."

Symptoms and signs are classified as 'impairment of body function'. The type of impairment classified as 'activity limitation' are difficulties that a patient may have in executing certain activities, for example, communication impairment in patients with aphasia following a stroke or the inability to pick up a cup in the affected hand. The type of impairment classified as 'participation restriction' are problems a patient may have in social roles - for example as a spouse or parent. The type of impairment classified as 'pathology' would be the diagnosis/disease. Right total anterior circulation infarct relates to the Oxford Bamford classification for stroke. "

Historically he had had similar lesions in the past which had been treated with unspecified local medications. On examination he was found to have multiple erythematous scaly plaques with a raised peripheral margin, a clear centre with hyper-pigmentation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic contact dermatitis,Fixed drug eruption,Psoriasis,Sarcoidosis,Tinea corporis,E,"Dermatophytosis is common in athletes. It usually presents with annular scaly plaques with active peripheral margins and central clearing resulting in increasing size of the lesions. The lesions are typically itchy and increase in number over a period of time. The affliction on legs and thighs is termed tinea corporis. It is occupational dermatoses in athletes and may be recurrent in them if due precautions are not taken. Allergic contact dermatitis will present with itchy papulo-vesicular eruption at the site of contact of the allergen. Fixed drug eruption presents with erythematous or hyperpigmented macules or patches, sometimes with central bullae. History of drug intake may be forthcoming and a history of recurrent such episodes at the same site may be present. Psoriasis presents with papulosquamous lesions with micaceous scaling.

Which of the following measures would be the most appropriate immediate step in the management of this patient?",Coagulation screen,IV fluids,IV N-acetyl cysteine,Oral methionone,Paracetamol levels,B,The most pressing issue in this patient is resuscitation as he is vomiting and is hypotensive. It is unusual to see such hypotension in paracetamol overdose but is feasible in a massive overdose and usually associated with lactic acidosis. It is too early to carry out paracetamol levels as these should be carried out at four hours. Although he states that he has taken 18 g of paracetamol this may not be the case and he may not require N-acetyl cysteine. You can wait. In fact the benefit of N-acetyl cysteine is maximum as long as it is given within eight hours of ingestion. Its benefit extends up to 24 hours. An elevated international normalised ratio (INR) gives an indication of hepatocellular damage and again this will not be seen at presentation of paracetamol overdose.

He also has a fever and feels like he has a mild cold. On examination his temperature is 37.8°C, BP is 110/70, pulse is 85 and regular. On examination, there is obvious flexural eczema which is poorly controlled, covered with extensive crops of vesicles, some of which have been de-roofed to form ulcers. Blood testing reveals a mildly elevated CRP, but remaining investigations are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?",Aciclovir,Flucloxacillin,High dose topical corticosteroids,Oral corticosteroids,Varicella Zoster Immunoglobulin,A,"The answer is Aciclovir. This patient's vesicular rash is most likely due to herpes simplex infection, superadded over the eczema rash: a condition known as eczema herpeticum. Patients with poorly controlled eczema are at increased risk of developing disseminated infection. It is a dermatological emergency, and oral aciclovir should be initiated immediately. Parenteral treatment is usually only required if a patient is unable to take tablets, or their condition is deteriorating despite oral medication. The superficial infection isn't bacterial, flucloxacillin is therefore not of value. VZIG is not of value because the rash is related to herpes simplex infection, and further use of corticosteroids risk spreading the vesicles further (although topical steroids can sometimes be used if the atopic rash is severe).

He has a no past medical history of note and tells you that he suffered a streptococcal throat infection two to three weeks earlier, for which he took a one-week course of antibiotics. Apparently, the rash has appeared virtually overnight. On examination, he has multiple erythematous papules and plaques on his trunk and upper arms with superficial scaling. Vital signs are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Drug eruption,Guttate psoriasis,Lichen planus,Pityriasis lichenoides,Pityriasis rosea,B,"The answer is guttate psoriasis. Guttate psoriasis is characteristically said to occur two to three weeks after a streptococcal infection. Multiple psoriatic plaques can appear over a short period of time, the palms and soles are rarely affected, and the plaques are mildly itchy and usually self- limiting, resolving over a period of a few days/weeks. UV-B radiation therapy may accelerate plaque resolution in patients with extensive disease. The disease is seen more commonly in patients with certain HLA types, namely HLA-BW17, HLA-B13, and HLA-CW6. A drug eruption is unlikely two weeks after completion of the course of antibiotics, and pityriasis rosea normally begins with a herald patch on the chest. Pityriasis lichenoides is a possible differential, although acute disease normally occurs as a papular rash rather than the psoriatic plaques seen here. Similar to pityriasis rosea, lichen planus usually affects a limited area of skin at onset."
others,281,An 18-year-old woman attends antenatal clinic 12 weeks into her pregnancy; the doctor incidentally notes numerous small lumps over her trunk and freckles in her axillae. She reported that none of her relatives had any similar features. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Acanthosis nigricans,Dysplastic naevus syndrome,Mastocytosis,Neurofibromatosis,Tuberous sclerosis,D,"The patient is likely to have neurofibromatosis (NF1). To be given the diagnosis of NF1, an individual must have at least two of the following features:  six or more café-au-lait spots two or more neurofibromas or a plexiform neurofibroma axillary freckling (can also be present in the groins) optic glioma lisch nodules (visible within the iris), or a family history.  In 50% of cases there will be no family history as there is a high incidence of new mutations. Acanthosis nigricans is velvety hyperpigmentation usually present within the axillae, and associated with obesity or endocrinologies. Dysplastic naevus syndrome is a familial cutaneous condition which is characterised by atypical naevi and melanomas. Mastocytosis describes the proliferation and accumulation of mast cells within the organs. In the skin, it can present with urticaria, maculopapular lesions, and diffuse infiltration. Tuberous sclerosis is characterised by the formation of hamartomas in a number of different organs, including the brain, skin, and kidney."
others,282,An 18-year-old woman is admitted after taking drugs at a night club. Which of the following features suggest she had taken Ecstasy (MDMA)?,A pyrexia of 40anddeg;C ,Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia,Metabolic acidosis,Respiratory depression,A,"Features of the amphetamine MDMA abuse include:  hyponatraemia tachycardia hyperventilation, and hyperthermia."
others,283,An 18-year-old woman presents three days after allegedly taking 50 paracetamol tablets (25 g). Which of the following tests measured at this time point would be most helpful in determining the outcome?,ALT concentration,Bilirubin concentration,Creatinine concentration,Paracetamol concentration,Prothrombin time,E,"The patient has ingested a seriously toxic dose of paracetamol. The best determinant of this risk at 72 hours would be a prolonged prothrombin time. Paracetamol concentrations would be rather meaningless at this point in time, and irrespective, she should be treated with N-acetylcysteine. There are four phases of paracetamol overdose. Phase 1 (0-24 hours):  asymptomatic anorexia nausea or vomiting malaise, and subclinical rise in serum aspartate transaminase (AST) - 12 hours post ingestion.  Phase 2 (18-72 hours):  right upper quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and continued rise in serum transaminases levels (note this is the time slot for our patient with the alanine transaminase [ALT] rises).  Phase 3 (72-96 hours):  centrilobular hepatic necrosis with continued abdominal pain jaundice coagulopathy hepatic encephalopathy nausea and vomiting renal failure, and  fatally rising international normalised ratio/prothrombin time (INR/PT) from three days.  Phase 4 (four days to three weeks):  complete resolution of symptoms, and complete resolution of organ failure."
others,284,"An 68-year-old man is undergoing a left inguinal hernia repair. To achieve haemostasis, you use monopolar diathermy. Which of the following is correct regarding monopolar diathermy?",Blend facility only functions in the coagulation mode,Plate must be at least 20 cm^2,Produces cutting diathermy at temperatures of up to 500°C,Produces local coagulation by a local heating effect,Spreads current from the plate to the electrode (diathermy point),D,"In monopolar diathermy the high frequency alternating current (AC) passes through the active electrode (diathermy tip) which has a very small surface area producing a powerful heating affect. The current passes from the diathermy tip to the plate. The plate should be in good contact with the patient and be a minimum of 70 cm^2. Misapplication of the patient plate is the commonest cause of inadvertent diathermy burns. Cell water is instantly vaporised causing tissue disruption and a degree of coagulation. The blend facility only functions in the cutting mode, allowing a combination of cutting and coagulation to increase the degree of haemostasis during cutting."
others,285,"An 80-year-old female presents with recurrent falls. She has fallen a few times whilst walking to the toilet at night to pass urine. She always feels light-headed prior to falling and denies palpitations. She suffers from ischaemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolaemia, osteoporosis and hypothyroidism. She is taking gliclazide, metformin, ramipril, doxazosin, levothyroxine, aspirin, simvastatin and weekly alendronate. Her blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg and her pulse is 70 beats per minute and is irregular. She undergoes a medication review as part of a multi-factorial risk assessment. Which one of the following medications is most likely to be the culprit for her symptoms?",Alendronate,Doxazosin,Levothyroxine,Metformin,Ramipril,B,The patient has symptoms of postural hypotension and subsequent presyncope. It may be possible that she has a degree of autonomic dysfunction secondary to diabetes mellitus that would put her at even greater risk of postural hypotension with an alpha blocker. The most likely cause is the alpha blocker doxazosin that is used for hypertension. Doxazocin is the most likely to cause postural hypotension. 
others,286,"An 82-year-old Afro-Caribbean lady presents with epigastric pain, which was acute in onset 4h prior to attendance at Aandamp;E. The pain has been associated with vomiting small amounts of bilious fluid. She has a past medical history of diabetes and had a stroke 4 years previously. She is a non-smoker. On examination, she is afebrile (37.4ºC), has a heart rate of 110bpm, respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 95/50 and saturations of 92% on air. She has no significant tenderness on abdominal examination and bowel sounds, although scanty, sound normal. BM is 12.4. ECG shows a sinus tachycardia with some ST elevation in lead II and III.  Of the options listed below, what is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute myocardial infarct,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Diverticular abscess,Pancreatitis,Small bowel obstruction,A,"Although the classical presentation of a myocardial infarct is with chest pain, it is important to recognise that not all patients with acute MI will have this symptom. Here, the presence of cardiovascular risk factors in combination with a normal abdominal examination (except for a probable ileus) in combination with ST elevation makes an acute MI the most likely diagnosis. Patients presenting without chest pain tend to be less likely to be treated with thrombolysis or primary angioplasty, and tend to present to hospital later. In hospital, morality is higher in those presenting without chest pain, and the absence of chest pain has been shown to be an independent predictor of mortality^1. ECGs of these patients show fewer Q-waves, and anterior infarcts are less likely. Those presenting without chest pain tend to be older (over 75 years), female, and of non-white racial origin. An American study published in 2000 showed that andquot;patients without chest pain also have a higher prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, prior heart failure and stroke, and a lower prevalence of smoking history, hypercholesterolaemia, family history of coronary artery disease or prior revascularisation with either angioplasty or CABG surgeryandquot;^1. Abdominal pain, particularly epigastric pain, is an alternative presentation of acute MI. This may be present in combination with nausea and vomiting. In some studies, up to 10% of patients with acute MI present with epigastric pain2. It may be that these patients are more likely to have an inferior infarct^2. Chest pain is considered by some as a late marker of ischaemia, and numerous studies have shown the discordance between chest pain and coronary artery patency1. If the patient had a diverticular abscess you would expect her to be febrile, and have focal tenderness on abdominal examination. As diverticular disease most commonly affects the sigmoid colon this tenderness is most commonly in the left iliac fossa. Small bowel obstruction classically results in a distended abdomen with 'tinkling' bowel sounds. Diabetic ketoacidosis can mimic an acute abdomen, presenting with abdominal pain. This tends to be present more frequently in those with severe metabolic acidosis, and in those with a history of alcohol abuse. Pancreatitis tends to present with sudden onset severe upper abdominal pain, associated with vomiting. You would expect a mild pyrexia with significant abdominal tenderness on examination. The key point to remember is that abdominal pain can represent both surgical and non-surgical pathology. The main surgical pathology includes bowel perforation or obstruction, and intra-abdominal infections. No-surgical causes of abdominal pain are common and include myocardial infarction, pneumonia, diabetic ketoacidosis and pancreatitis.  "
others,287,"An 82-year-old lady had a history of a red facial rash and has suffered with venous eczema of the legs. She was treated for acne rosacea. On examination, she was noted to have blue-grey discolouration of both legs. Which drug is most likely to have caused this?",Amiodarone,Ciprofloxacin,Doxycycline,Minocycline,Oxytetracycline,D,"This patient has developed skin pigmentation of her legs as a side effect of treatment of her acne rosacea. Tetracyclines are commonly used treatment for acne rosacea. Long-term use of minocycline in particular has been associated with non-dose dependent blue-grey pigmentation of skin in the lower legs, and mucosal pigmentation. This is more common in the elderly. On biopsy, intracellular pigment is seen in the dermis and the subcutaneous tissue and stains positively for melanin and iron. If not extensive, hyperpigmentation may partially regress after minocycline is discontinued. If it persists, alexandrite laser therapy can be effective. Amiodarone can also cause a blue-grey slate discolouration of the skin, typically in sun exposed areas. You would therefore expect the face to be affected, and also amiodarone is not a treatment for acne rosacea which has been mentioned in this question to lead you to the correct answer. Hypersensitivity to the sun has been described with ciprofloxacin, but discolouration as in this scenario is not recognised. Oxytetetracycline and doxycycline can lead to photosensitivity, but skin pigmentation seems to be specific to minocycline rather than a class effect of the tetracyclines. "
others,288,"An 83-year-old man is admitted with lightheadedness and bradycardia. An ECG shows sinus bradycardia with a PR interval of 0.18s. You note that he is taking labetalol. On further questioning, he tells you that he has been taking labetalol at the same dose for years. His estimated glomerular filtration rate(eGFR) is 60 ml/min/1.73 m^2. Which of the following would most accurately describe the reason for developing bradycardia?",He has developed age-related sinus node dysfunction,Increased absorption due to slower gastric emptying,Labetalol follows zero order kinetics that change with age,Reduced first pass metabolism,Reduced glomerular filtration rate and excretion,D,"Reduced first pass metabolism is correct because drugs like labetalol undergo extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. Liver mass and blood flow decrease with age which in turn increases the bioavailability of drugs like labetalol giving rise to greater therapeutic effect. The patient may have taken the same dose of drugs for years, but as the liver ages, the bioavailability of the drugs increases as described above. "
others,289,"An 84-year-old lady is admitted to a rehabilitation unit following a stroke. On admission, a Barthel index is performed. Which of the following best describes the limitations of using the Barthel index in rehabilitation?",Floor and ceiling effects,It correlates poorly with other prognostic scales,It has poor concurrent and predictive validity,It is not very sensitive,It is laborious and takes a long time to perform,A,The most widely recognised limitation of the Barthel index is floor and ceiling effects. It basically means that a disabled person can score a maximum score of 100 and still not be independent. It is poor at differentiating disability in patients who function at a higher level. It also has floor effects as it may incorrectly score patients low who are initially bed bound following a stroke. The Barthel index correlates well with other prognostic scales. It has very good concurrent and predictive validity. It is very sensitive and it only takes 10 minutes to perform. 
others,290,"An 84-year-old lady is treated for a chest infection in hospital. On admission her creatinine kinase (CK) level was normal. Three days later she is found to be in renal failure and has a CK of 8000 mmol/L. She is taking simvastatin, aspirin, bisoprolol and St John's wort. Which of the following drugs would be the most likely cause?",Ciprofloxacin,Clarithromycin,Co-amoxiclav,Doxycycline,Metronidazole,B,"There is a significant drug interaction between clarithromycin and simvastatin. Clarithromycin strongly inhibits CYP3A4 - the enzyme responsible for simvastatin metabolism which can lead to rhabdomyolysis and renal failure. Macrolide antibiotics and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors should never be administered together. There can be a very rare interaction between ciprofloxacin and simvastatin that can give rise to rhabdomyolysis. The question, however, states the 'most likely' cause for the presentation and that would certainly be clarithromycin. Co-amoxiclav does not inhibit CYP4A4 and does not have a significant interaction with statins. There is no interaction between doxycycline and simvastatin. There is a moderate interaction that exists between simvastatin and metronidazole and patients should be closely monitored for symptoms of peripheral neuropathy. "
others,291,An 86-year-old woman presents with a third episode of urinary frequency and dysuria in eight months. A urine dipstick is positive for leukocytes but negative for nitrites. Examination of the genito-urinary area reveals marked atrophic vaginitis and she is commenced on topical oestrogen therapy. Oestrogen exerts its beneficial effect on the urogenital tissue by which of the following?,Decreasing para-urethral blood flow,Decreasing urethral closing pressure,Increasing para-urethral collagen concentration,Increasing vaginal pH,Preventing proliferation ofLactobacilli in the vagina,C,Oestrogen increases para-urethral blood flow. Oestrogen increases urethral closing pressure by increasing para-urethral collagen concentration and organisation. Oestrogen promotes the proliferation of Lactobacilli in the vagina. Oestrogen decreases vaginal pH by preventing Gram negative bacterial colonisation.
others,292,An 88-year-old woman is admitted with swollen legs and increased abdominal swelling. She is commenced on intravenous furosemide and responds well. You note that she has been on oral furosemide at home. Which of the following best explains the reason for the response to intravenous drugs?,Decreased protein binding of furosemide,Increased bioavailability,Increased effect on the loop of Henle,Increased first pass metabolism,Increased plasma volume,B,"This lady has a lot of gut oedema secondary to right heart failure which would reduce the absorption of oral furosemide. Intravenous furosemide would have a much better bioavailability and thus therapeutic effect. Protein binding of drugs may be reduced in elderly patients. This may be due to malnutrition. In this case scenario, however, furosemide is poorly absorbed from the gut. Intravenous furosemide would have a more pronounced effect on the loop of Henle due to increased bioavailability of the drug when given intravenously due to poor absorption secondary to gut oedema as stated above. Furosemide undergoes about 40% first pass metabolism, which may be reduced as a result of liver congestion. It is also conjugated to glucuronic acid in the kidney. The increased plasma volume is likely secondary to heart failure itself. "

others,294,Breast cancer risk is increased in association with which of the following?,During pregnancy,Early age at first pregnancy,Late menarche,Late menopause,Multiparity,D,"Breast cancer is predominately a disease of women and the risk increases as age increases. The risks are also greater in those women who have previously suffered with breast cancer and in Caucasian woman compared to woman of African descent. Other risk factors include genetic causes and family history, both maternal and paternal, particularly first degree relatives. Five to 10% of breast cancers are hereditary, as a result of mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Exposure to hormones is also a risk. Women who start their periods at an early age or experience a late menopause have a slightly higher risk of developing breast cancer. Conversely, being older at the time of the first menstrual period and early menopause tend to protect one from breast cancer. Having a child before age 30 years may provide some protection, and having no children may increase the risk for developing breast cancer. Other risk factors include lifestyle and dietary causes; breast cancer rates are higher in countries with high dietary intake of fat and obesity. Alcohol abuse also appears to elevate the risk of breast cancer. "
others,295,Breast cancer risk is increased in which of the following circumstances?,Immediately after a pre-term delivery,In a pregnancy complicated by pre-eclampsia,In microprolactinomas,In pregnancy complicated with a smaller placenta,In prolonged breast feeding,A,"Breast cancer risk is transiently increased immediately after a pregnancy, more so in full term pregnancy. Breast cancer risk is reduced if pregnancy is complicated by high blood pressure, pre-eclampsia or smaller placenta. Every year of breast feeding decreases the risk by 4%. There is no increased risk attributable to microprolactinomas; in fact, one might expect the risk to be reduced as a consequence of the reduced oestrogen secretion with hyperprolactinaemia."
others,296,"Concerning neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which one of the following statements is true?",Bilateral acoustic neuromas are common,Clinical severity in individuals is similar in a given family,New mutations occur rarely,Pigmented spots on the iris are a characteristic feature,The diagnosis is likely if two café-au-lait patches are present,D,"Lisch nodules of the iris are present in more than 90% of patients. Bilateral acoustic neuromas are a hallmark feature of neurofibromatosis type 2. Expressivity of the gene is highly variable and members of the same family usually show wide differences in clinical symptoms. NF1 is one of the most common autosomal dominant conditions. However almost half of all cases give no family history and are new mutations. The mutation rate is estimated to be 1:10,000 gametes. The diagnosis is suggested by six or more café-au-lait macules (spots), each over 5 mm in diameter in prepubescent individuals and over 15 mm in postpubertal individuals."
others,297,During a follow up visit at an asthma clinic a 38-year-old female complains of the appearance of a mole. Which of the following characteristics of the lesion would raise suspicion that it is a malignant melanoma?,Lesion has irregular outline,Lesion is deeply pigmented,Lesion is present on face,Lesion is raised,Lesion is 6 mm in diameter,A,The mnemonic of ABCDE regarding characteristics of a melanoma are as follows:  A - Asymmetry - one half of the lesion does not match the other half B - Border irregularity C - Colour variegation - pigmentation is not uniform D - Diameter- a diameter 6 mm or more warrants investigation although changes in size are also important E - Evolution - evolving size or changes in characteristics such as nodules.  
others,298,Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) for an AAA is performed via which of the following?,Femoral cut down and bypass,Femoral cut down and femoral artery cannulation,Laparoscopy,Laparotomy,Medial visceral rotation,B,Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is a simpler and safer way to treat AAA. It has lower morbidity and mortality compared with open aneurysm repair. It is performed via a femoral cut down and femoral artery cannulation. The stent is then introduced via the femoral artery and deployed within the aneurysm. An open aneurysm is performed via a laparotomy or medial visceral rotation. An alternative is laparoscopic or laparoscopic-assisted aneurysm repair.
others,299,"Following a severe paracetamol overdose, which of the following is true?",Acute haemolytic anaemia is a recognised complication,Hyperthermia can occur,Paracetamol metabolites are scavenged by glutamine,The initial clinical features provide a reliable guide to the severity of the poisoning,The plasma albumin concentration is the most sensitive indicator of impending acute hepatic failure,A,"Paracetamol hepatotoxicity is due to toxic oxidative metabolites combining with sulphydryl groups of hepatocyte proteins, causing centrilobular necrosis. The metabolites are usually scavenged by glutathione (not glutamine), but in a severe overdose this scavenging mechanism is rapidly overwhelmed. Treatment is based upon N-acetylcysteine which provides additional sulphydryl groups to scavenge the toxic metabolites. The initial clinical features of the overdose do not provide a reliable guide to the severity of poisoning, with more serious complications developing after 36 hours. These include:  Acute haemolytic anaemia Hypothermia Hypoglycaemia Metabolic acidosis Delirium Acute hepatic failure (AHF).  The prothrombin time is the most sensitive indicator of impending AHF (not albumin). Do not be confused by Child's criteria, which are used to calculate or assess the operative risk in patients with portal hypertension (as serum albumin falls so the score and hence the risk are increased)."
others,300,"Following a submersion event in water, which of the following is correct?",Cardiac arrest is usually a primary event,Large quantities of water are always found in the lungs of drowning victims,Patients are frequently hyperthermic,Pulmonary oedema may occur days after the submersion,Significant electrolyte abnormalities are common,D,"Drowning refers to submersion in water and the pronouncement of death within 24 hours of the event. If death does not occur then the event is described as a 'near drowning'. Submersion (head below the water) leads to a short period of breath holding, and when a breath is finally taken the entry of water causes laryngospasm and apnoea (at post mortem up to 20% of fatal drowning victims have no water in their lungs). A period of involuntary breathing may follow, during which time water enters the lungs causing a respiratory arrest and finally a cardiac arrest. Therefore, cardiac arrest is usually a secondary event, but it may also be a primary event (for example, exercise induced myocardial ischaemia). The clinical presentations of near drowning in salt water and fresh water are similar. Hypothermia (not hyperthermia) is common and this offers some protection (especially neurological) against the effects of hypoxia. Electrolyte abnormalities do occur but they are rarely significant or common. A severe permeability pulmonary oedema can occur up to three days following a near drowning event in both salt and fresh water. All unconscious patients removed from water should have cervical spine immobilisation until an injury can be excluded clinically and/or radiologically."
others,301,Gynaecomastia is caused by which of the following?,Bronchial carcinoma,Hydrocoele,Oesophageal carcinoma,Transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder,Varicocoele,A,"Causes of gynaecomastia include;  chromosomal abnormalities hyperthyroidism drugs (such as digoxin), and bronchial carcinoma/teratoma/seminoma."
others,302,Hoarseness may be caused by which of the following?,Antibiotic therapy,Dystrophia myotonica,Glossopharyngeal nerve neuropraxia,Laryngeal tumour,Thyrotoxicosis,D,"Hoarseness can occur as a consequence of:  Infections (laryngitis - bacterial, viral or fungal) Drugs (particularly steroids - hence the connection with RA) Surgery (following injury to recurrent laryngeal nerve after thyroidectomy) Neurological diseases such as myasthenia gravis (not myotonica), and Laryngeal tumours."
others,303,How is nutritional status most commonly measured in adults?,Albumin on blood testing,Body mass index,Ponderal index,Skin fold thickness,Weight,B,"The measurement and assessment of nutritional status is difficult and unfortunately there is no single test that can help us here. The most common measurement in routine clinical practice is the body mass index which is calculated as follows:    BMI (kg/m^2) =  weight (kg)   height (m) × height (m)    Most clinicians use the BMI as a useful measure of adiposity and nutritional status. This measure is simple and fast to calculate and interpret. It was originally invented in the 19th century but was applied to clinical usage in 1972. Although the BMI is convenient it has limitations for the assessment of obesity in individual patients. It is best used in this setting to assess trends in an individual patient. In patients who are very tall or who have an active lifestyle with a high proportion of lean tissue, the BMI overestimates fat mass. The BMI may be particularly misleading in athletes and children. Other measurements such as skin fold thickness and weight are useful too, but the BMI is probably better. The ponderal index is used in children. Albumin is not a good marker of nutritional status as it is also affected by inflammation."
others,304,Hypotension one hour following a laparotomy may be caused by which of the following?,Bleeding,Blocked urinary catheter,Hypoventilation,Malignant hyperpyrexia,Pain,A,"Post-operative hypotension is most commonly due to epidural or spinal anaesthesia due to a reduced systemic reduction. However, it is important to exclude ongoing bleeding. The most common cause of post-operative hypertension is inadequately controlled pain. A full bladder due to urinary retention or a blocked catheter can also cause agitation and pain. Hypercapnoea, due to alveolar hypoventilation, can cause hypertension. This may be due to respiratory depression following a general anaesthetic or excess opioids used for analgesia. Malignant hyperpyrexia (MH) is an inherited disease (autosomal dominant) affecting skeletal muscle contraction and metabolism. It follows exposure to triggering agents, particularly volatile anaesthetic agents and suxamethonium. The following are features of this life threatening condition which usually presents early during an anaesthetic but can be delayed for several hours:  Cardiovascular instability Cyanosis Hypercapnoea Hyperkalaemia, and Hyperthermia."
others,305,If a patient presents with a homonymous hemianopia where is the likely site of the lesion?,Optic nerve,Parietal lobe,Optic chiasm,Optic Radiation,Temporal lobe,D,A lesion in the optic tract or radiation leads to a homonymous hemianopia. If the optic chiasm is affected then you expect to find a bitemporal hemianopia. Lesions in the temporal lobe lead to a homonymous superior quadrantanopia whilst those in the parietal lobe an inferior quadrantanopia. Lesion in the optic nerve would lead to a loss of vision in one eye.
others,306,"In a critical care setting, which of the following is correct?",Higher ICU throughput is associated with significantly higher mortality rates,Only patients with a potentially reversible condition should be admitted,Single organ failure requires ICU admission,There is a higher mortality if transferred from theatre,There is a nurse : patient ratio of 1:3,B,"Critical care units require a nurse to patient ratio of 1:2 or fewer. Patients with single organ failure can be monitored or treated in HDU. However, if a patient requires ventilation they will require transfer to ICU. Mortality is higher in patients admitted from general wards as these patients have usually received suboptimal basic treatment before admission. Patients with no hope of improvement should not be admitted to a critical care area. Higher ICU throughput is associated with significantly lower mortality rates."
others,307,"In a man who is neglected and alcohol dependent, whith high suicidal risk, which factor can increase this risk further?",Alcohol dependence,SSRI,Smoking,Agoraphobia,Court involvement,B,He is already alcohol dependent. So further (additional) risk factor is SSRI (SSRI has well known risk of developing suicidal ideation. Arrest and court involvement is also a risk factor and in a neglected person it is also a strong risk factor

Shigellosis is a possible cause. Most cases of Shigella infection are related to foreign travel. Unrelated to foreign travel, there has been an increase in sexually transmitted Shigella infection in men who have sex with men. Amoebic trophozoites (the active form) may be seen in fresh stool in acute dysentery. However, amoebic cysts seen on microscopy for E. Histolytica have a sensitivity of less than60% and a specificity of 10-50% in the diagnosis of possible amoebic dysentery. There are many non-pathological amoebae (e.g. E. dispar) and many asymptomatic patients have Entamoeba histolytica in their stool. Stool antigen (ELISA) for Entamoeba histolytica has sensitivity and specificity of greater than95%. Watery diarrhoea would be expected with cholera and giardiasis. "
others,309,"In compartment syndrome in children, which of the following is correct?",Capillary pressure exceeds interstitial pressure,Fracture of a long bone is never present,Muscle ischaemia occurs,The usual cause is thrombophilia causing arterial occlusion,Volkmann's ischaemic contracture occurs following fasciotomy,C,"Compartment syndrome usually develops over a period of hours. It is most often associated with crush injuries, although it may also be associated with long bone fractures. If the interstitial pressure exceeds capillary pressure, local muscle ischaemia occurs. If this is unrecognised Volkmann's ischaemic contracture eventually results. It is treated by the release of constricting bandages and splints first, followed by urgent fasciotomy if there is no improvement."
others,310,"In Lentigo Maligna, what is most important in determining the prognosis?",Thickness of lesion,Pigmentation,Size,Bleeding,Irregularity of border,A,The best prognostic indicator is the thickness of the lesion. Site of the lesion is also important with lesions on the limbs having the best prognosis. The others are not important indicators of prognosis.
others,311,"In the assessment of a 2-year-old boy with burns, which is correct?",Full thickness burns are exquisitely painful,Partial thickness burns result in blistering,Superficial burns do not blanch,The percentage of burns refers to the area affected by burns of all thickness,The andquot;Rule of Ninesandquot; should be applied,B,"There are four stages to the assessment of burns for severity: 1. Associated smoke inhalation:  All affected children should be admitted for observation.  2. Depth of burn:  Superficial - epithelium intact, exquisitely painful Partial thickness - blistering, pink mottled skin Full thickness - skin is destroyed down to and including the dermis, and healing is from the margins. Skin is white, charred and painless.  3. Surface area of burn:  This is worked out from a special chart, since the percentage for each area of the body changes with age (for example, Lund-Browder chart) Percentages are calculated independently for each level of burn Greater than 50% burns have a limited chance of survival.  4.Involvement of special sites:  The face, the mouth and the hands and the perineum are particularly important."
others,312,In the early management of adult burns which of the following is correct?,Application of silver sulfadiazine is recommended prior to transfer to a burns unit,Most chemical burns should be irrigated with water until the patient reaches hospital,Clothing should not be removed immediately since this tears away healthy skin,Colloids should always be used for initial resuscitation,Nasogastric tubes should be avoided since they predispose to gastric ulcers,B,"All clothing should be removed as soon as possible; any skin that is adherent and peels off with the clothing is 'dead' and it is essential to remove all dead tissue. Like other forms of burns, chemical burns should be irrigated with copious amounts of water, ensuring, as far as possible, that this irrigation does not come in contact with undamaged skin (alkaline burns will need irrigation for longer duration). Application of silver sulfadiazine before the patient is transferred to the burns unit is not recommended since this makes it difficult accurately to assess the burn depth. Crystalloids or colloids could be used in the initial resuscitation of a burns patient. Adequate hydration is more important than the precise type of fluid used. Nasogastric tubes help to decompress the stomach. This ensures mucosal integrity thus minimising the risk of endogenous infection and bacterial translocation. There is no evidence to suggest that NG tube causes gastric ulcers in burn patients."
others,313,"In the initial management of burns in the Emergency department, which of the following is correct?","A full-thickness burn is painful, red and blistered",Cold water should be applied to extensive burns,"In children, intravenous fluids are indicated only if the burn is greater than20% of total body surface area",Intravenous access should be secured through burned skin only if no other access is available,The adult patient requires transfer to the burns unit only when the burn is greater than40% of total body surface area,D,"Partial thickness burns are painful, red and blistered. Full-thickness burns are painless and white/grey. All adults with greater than 20% burns, and children and elderly with greater than 10% burns should be transferred to the burns unit as soon as they are stabilised. Intravenous access should be secured by any means, even through burned skin. Intravenous cutdown in the cubital fossae or on the long saphenous vein (either in front of the medial malleolus or the groin) may be required if percutaneous intravenous access cannot be obtained. In children less than 6-years-old, if intravenous access is not obtained, access should be sought through an intraosseous approach (commonly in the tibia). Applying cold water to extensive burns can intensify shock. All burned areas should be covered with sterile, warm, non-adherent dressing (taking care to prevent hypothermia) or cling film before the patient is transferred to the burns unit. Intravenous fluids are essential in burns involving more than 10% total body surface area in children and more than 15% total body surface area in adults. "
others,314,"In the management of burns in a specialised burns unit, which of the following is correct?",Autografting (during the first surgery) is always possible in burns involving up to 60% total body surface area,Chemical burns may cause more skin damage (in terms of burn depth) than scalds,"In a fit 34-year-old male with full thickness burns involving 55% total body surface area, late debridement and grafting is recommended",Meshed skin grafts achieve superior cosmetic results compared to unmeshed skin grafts,Skin grafting is absolutely contraindicated in the presence of Enterococcus faecalis in the wound,B,"In a patient with full thickness burns, early excision of all burned skin is recommended. Grafting, if not possible, could be done at a later time. Enterococcus faecalis is a common skin contaminant in burns and its colonisation does not preclude successful skin grafting. Unmeshed skin grafts achieve superior cosmetic results compared to meshed skin grafts. Meshed grafts are recommended in areas where continued oozing is anticipated since meshing prevents development of underlying haematoma. Autografting is not possible in burns involving more than 40% total body surface area without reusing the donor site again in the next 7-10 days. Chemicals burns cause extensive skin damage. Unlike scalds, chemical burns that appear superficial at presentation soon progress to full thickness (deep dermal)."
others,315,"In the treatment of psoriasis, which of the following statements is correct?",Etanercept is not effective in psoriatic arthritis,Infliximab is associated with tuberculosis,PUVA is ineffective,Retinoids are the most useful monotherapy in psoriatic patients,Vitamin D analogues are associated with cutaneous atrophy,B,"Psoralen and ultraviolet light (PUVA) is an effective treatment for psoriasis, but has been related to increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma and possibly malignant melanoma. Retinoids are most effective in combination therapy especially with ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy and PUVA. Part of the attraction of vitamin D analogues over steroids is that they do not cause cutaneous atrophy, whereas steroids do. The recombinant tumour necrosis factor and receptor fusion protein, etanercept, has demonstrated considerable beneficial effects on psoriatic arthropathy in placebo controlled, double blind studies. Infliximab is associated with tuberculosis by reactivation of latent disease. Thus it is advised that patients who are to be treated with infliximab are tuberculin tested and if required receive chest radiography."
others,316,"In trauma patients, the treatment of acute pain is associated with which one of the following?",Decreased muscle spasm,Improved identification of clinical signs,Increased incidence of pulmonary complications,Increased metabolic processes,Increased risk of thromboembolism,A,"Appropriate analgesia should be given to all trauma patients. Pain will usually cause immobilisation of the patient and thus increases the risk of developing venous thrombosis and venous thromboembolism (DVT and PE). When in pain, patients have shallow respirations and usually are reluctant to cough or sigh. This causes atelectasis and increases the risk of chest infections (pneumonia). When adequate analgesia is provided, tidal volumes are greater, with less atelectasis and a reduced incidence of pulmonary complications is seen. Pain causes adrenergic stimulation and this increases metabolic responses, including:  Gluconeogenesis Glycolysis Lipolysis, and Production of free fatty acids.  Treatment of pain will decrease this response. Pain associated with fractures can cause skeletal muscle spasm, which if left untreated not only helps to maintain the pain but can also make the reduction of fractures very difficult. Although analgesia improves patient co-operation during examination and radiological investigation, some important clinical signs and symptoms can be masked. The interpretation of an abdominal examination may be more difficult and some cervical spine fractures have also been missed following the administration of analgesia."
others,317,In which of the following would you be likely to observe the lowest heritability score?,Cleft lip/palate,Congenital heart disease,Cystic fibrosis,Mumps,Spina bifida,D,"Mumps is due to an infective agent and hence has the lowest heritability score. All the other disorders have a genetic aetiological component, for example, cystic fibrosis is autosomal recessive. Medline plus - Heritability scores"
others,318,Indications for tonsillectomy include which of the following?,Seven or more episodes of tonsillitis in a year,Peritonsillar abscess,Persistently enlarged tonsils,Recurrent glue ear requiring grommet insertion,Snoring,A,"The indications for tonsillectomy are as follows^1:  recurrent tonsillitis enlarged tonsils causing airway obstruction, potentially contributing to obstructive sleep apnoea suspected or confirmed malignant disease of the tonsils.  Recurrent tonsillitis is defined within the SIGN guidelines as 7 or more episodes in the previous year, 5 in each of the last 2 years or 3 in each of the last 3 years of moderate severity, and where sore throat prevents normal functioning.^2 "
others,319,"Mr S, a 65-year-old patient of yours comes to see you with his wife. She is concerned about his change in behaviour over the past three months. He has been more and more withdrawn - stopped going to the club or out to dinner and they used to have a very active social life. He complains of being quite andquot;depressedandquot;. He is fit and well apart from the hearing loss you know he has had for years. He has bilateral industrial noise-induced hearing loss now compounded by presbyacusis. She tells you that his deafness is getting worse - she has to shout at him even when his hearing aids are in. This is in spite of having well fitted hearing aids which have been regularly checked. He complains he has to turn his hearing aids up so loud to hear her talk that all he gets is a lot of background noise. What is your advice?",Explain that he may be a candidate for a cochlear implant and refer him to a cochlear implant clinic for audiological and candidacy assessment ,"Express regret that while cochlear implants can help people with his type of hearing loss, he is unfortunately too old for this intervention ",Prescribe a short course of antidepressants and encourage him to go out to the places he used to with lots of people to cheer him up ,"Suggest he stop wearing his hearing aids if they are not helping him, and take up some more individual pastimes, join the local library etc ",Tell him to persist with his hearing aids as they are the only alternative to no hearing that he has available to him ,A,"This patient is a perfect candidate for cochlear implantation based on the elements of his history described. He has a bilateral sensori-neural hearing loss initially helped by hearing aids, but which has progressively worsened over time to a point where his hearing aids only deliver noise, rather than clarity of speech. Inability to cope in noisy social situations is commonly observed in people with a worsening hearing loss and can lead to social withdrawal, isolation and depression. Post-linguisitically deafened adults who receive a cochlear implant soon after the deterioration of their hearing perform very well post-implantation as their auditory pathways and memory are intact."
others,320,Oral aphthous ulceration is associated with which condition?,Addison's disease,Coeliac disease,Myxedema,Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,Thyrotoxicosis,B,"Aphthous ulceration may occur with conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, infections such as herpes simplex, coeliac disease, lichen planus, leucopenia and oral cancers. Drugs such as carbimazole/propylthiouracil (PTU) may cause the condition but not thyrotoxicosis per se. Addison's is associated with oral pigmentation as is Peutz-Jeghers."
others,321,"Patient with history of alcoholism, ataxic gait, hallucinations and loss of memory. He is given acamprosate. What other drug can you give with this?",Chlordiazepoxide,Thiamine,Diazepam,Disulfiram,Haloperidol,B,These are features of wernicke’s encephalopathy
others,322,"Postoperatively, which of the following statements is true?",Bleeding is nearly always due to a coagulopathy,"In patients with coronary stents, clopidogrel should be stopped for seven days","In patients with metallic valves, anticoagulation should be stopped for 24 hours because of the risk of bleeding",NSAIDs should be combined with aspirin and anticoagulants,Thrombocytopenia can result from heparin therapy,E,Post-operative bleeding may be surgical or coagulation related. Liaise closely with cardiology; drug-eluting stents can re-stenose if clopidogrel is not continued. Liaise closely with cardiology; metallic valves often need continuous heparin infusions to prevent thrombotic events and valve damage. The risk of gastrointestinal haemorrhage increases when NSAIDs and anticoagulants are combined. Heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is well described in the literature.
others,323,Progressive massive fibrosis (PMF) is most likely to be found in which of the following?,Complicated silicosis,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Lobar pneumonia,Sarcoidosis,Simple coal worker's pneumoconiosis,A,"Progressive massive fibrosis is diagnosed by chest x ray as round masses, several centimetres in diameter, usually in the upper lobes. They may have necrotic centres. In silicosis a more accurate term is 'conglomerate nodules'. It is due to exposure to dust of high silicon content and hence PMF is more likely with higher silicon exposure than in simple coal worker's lung. Lobar pneumonia and sarcoidosis would not cause PMF and should normally leave no respiratory problem following treatment."
others,324,Psoriasis is associated with what HLA subtype?,HLA DR4,HLA B5,HLA B4,HLA B27,HLA CW6,E,Psoriasis is associated with HLA CW6 and HLA DR7. Pustular psoriasis and seronegative arthritis are associated with HLA B27. Rheumatoid Arthritis is associated with HLA DR3
others,325,"Regarding necrotising fasciitis, which of the following statements is correct?",Conservative excision of the necrotic fascia and skin and muscle should be carried out within 24 hours,It can be treated with high dose antibiotic therapy alone,"It is a severe infective process, but the skin may initially appear normal",It is common after minor trauma in diabetic patients,Surgery should be deferred until results of microbiology cultures are available,C,"In order to limit infection spread urgent wide surgical excision is preferred to conservative excision. Most cases are polymicrobial in origin. Broad spectrum antibiotics, according to local protocols, should be administered together with fluid resuscitation and urgent surgical debridement. Planned 'second look' operations are usually required. The skin initially appears normal as the pathology lies within the subcutaneous tissue and deep fascia. Necrotising fasciitis can arise without any history of injury, but can also follow operations or more localised infections. Diabetes, smoking, obesity, perineal infection and intravenous drug use are contributing factors. "
others,326,Regarding peri-operative management which of the following is correct?,"Following abdominal surgery, regular deep breathing and a sufficient cough does not affect the incidence of chest infections",Low molecular weight heparin post-operatively excludes pulmonary emboli (PE) as a cause of chest pain,Nil by mouth includes oral medications,Patients should generally be encouraged to mobilise early in the post-operative period,Post-operative opiates reduce physiological stress and improve outcomes,D,"Post-operative atelectasis is common and can be improved by physiotherapy and breathing exercises. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) will reduce the incidence of PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but not remove all risk. Except when a patient is vomiting, has an ileus, or has a nasogastric tube, oral medications can usually be continued. Early mobilisation reduces the risk of DVT and PE. Opiates cause respiratory depression and may delay mobilisation."
others,327,Sterilisation can be achieved by using which of the following?,Alcohol,Chlorhexidine,Ethylene oxide,Glutaraldehyde,Iodine,C,"Ethylene oxide is a highly penetrative gas capable of killing bacteria, spores and viruses. It is predominantly used for the industrial sterilisation of heat sensitive equipment, such as plastics, as well as sutures and single use equipment. The other agents listed are all used for disinfection rather than sterilisation and are not capable of removing all micro-organisms."
others,328,The opinion of an intensivist should be sought in which of the following circumstances?,Fall in Glasgow coma scale (GCS) by more than 3 points,Pulse greater than 120 beats/min,Rising PaCO2 with alkalosis,Single seizure,Temperature above 39.5°C,A,The following are indications for seeking an intensivist's review: Airway:  Threatened airway  Breathing:  Respiratory arrest Respiratory rate greater than40 or less than 8 SaO2 less than90% on 50 % oxygen  Circulation:  Cardiac arrest Pulse less than40 or greater than140 Systolic BP less than90 mmHg Metabolic acidosis  Disability:  Sudden fall in level of consciousness: there is a risk to the airway Repeated or prolonged seizures.
others,329,The pulmonary vascular system is different from the systemic circulation in that the pulmonary system demonstrates which of the following?,"High pressures, high flow rates, highly compliant vessels","High pressures, high flow rates, low compliance vessels","Low pressures, high flow rates, high compliance vessels","Low pressures, low flow rates, high compliance vessels","Low pressures, low flow rates, low compliance vessels",C,"The normal pulmonary circulation is characterised by low pressures, high flow rates, high compliance vessels."
others,330,Tourniquets may be used in which of the following?,Deep vein thrombosis,Diabetes,Limb infections,Peripheral arterial disease,Sickle cell disease,B,"Limb occlusion pressure is the minimum tourniquet pressure to occlude blood supply. Tourniquets may be used in the elderly and in diabetics who do not have peripheral neuropathy. They are contraindicated in patients with sickle cell disease, any peripheral vascular disease (including deep vein thrombosis) and limb infections. With limb infections a good arterial blood supply is essential for resolution. An anaerobic infection would be enhanced with a tourniquet (you should always worry about C. perfringens and C. septicum)."
others,331,Treatment of hand wounds caused by bites include which one of the following?,A four week course of oral antibiotics for a superficial bite wound,Bite wounds should be closed with interrupted sutures,Bite wounds should be closed with a subcuticular suture,Tetanus toxoid prophylaxis,The use of a tourniquet should be avoided when exploring a septic hand wound,D,"Human and animal bites are usually heavily contaminated and may require debridement, irrigation, immobilisation and systemic antibiotics. Superficial bites often require cleansing and a course of antibiotics. If the patient is not already covered they will require a tetanus booster. Tourniquets are useful as they produce a bloodless field. Bite wounds to the hand should never be closed primarily. Local anaesthetic should not be injected into infected tissue as it has a poor action in the acid medium. Ring block for distal finger injury, or regional anaesthesia may be used rather than a general anaesthetic."
others,332,What is the gold standard test for early diabetic retinopathy?,Pupillometry,Fluorescein angiography,Ocular ultrasound,Electroretinography,Biopsy,B,"Fluorescein angiography can be used to accurately detect tiny microaneurysms, which are the first signs of diabetic retinopathy."
others,333,What is the most appropriate investigation for amaurosis fugax?,CT head,ECG,Fluorescein angiography,MRI head,Carotid Doppler,E,Amaurosis fugax is episodic total loss of vision in one eye which completely resolves within an hour. The most common cause is ipsilateral carotid artery disease. The most appropriate investigation is a carotid Doppler.
others,334,What treatment should be avoided for hyphaema?,No treatment,Topical,Pain relief with aspirin,Anterior chamber paracentesis,Antibiotics,C,"Hyphaema is blood filling the anterior chamber and is caused by ocular trauma. Treatment is with bedrest with the head at 45 degrees(to prevent a rebleed), wearing an eye shield at night to prevent accidental rubbing of the eye which would cause a rebleed and avoidance of medications that thin the blood (aspirin etc). Steroid drop or mydriatic drugs are sometimes used in more serious cases but this is controversial. The majority of hyphemas resolve without any drug treatment."
others,335,What would be found on fundoscopy if a patient has maculopathy?,"Macular oedema, ischaemia and cotton wool spots",Neovascularisation,"Macular oedema, ischaemia and hard exudates",Normal fundus,Flame haemorrhage and cotton wool spots,C,"Maculopathy is characterised by macular oedema, ischaemia and hard exudates. The exudates may be arranged in a circle surrounding leaking vessel."
others,336,Which feature suggests malignant transformation in a pigmented naevus?,Decreasing pigmentation,Insensate,Rapid decrease in size of lesion,Ulceration,Vitiligo,D,"Features that suggest malignant transformation in a naevus include:  Bleeding Ulceration Itch Increasing pigmentation, and Increasing size."
others,337,Which is correct regarding pain in the post-operative period?,Increases the risks of post-operative cardiac ischaemia,Is associated with decreased risk of DVT,Is best managed with an intermittent (PRN) regimen,May improve respiratory function,The dose of opiate should not vary between patients,A,"Pain increases sympathetic output leading to increased myocardial oxygen demand and therefore the risk of myocardial ischaemia, especially in patients with pre-existing heart disease. Poorly managed post-operative pain results in delayed mobilisation and in turn increased risk of DVT. Poor management of post operative pain impairs the patient's ability to cough and deep breathe leading to retention of secretions, atelectasis and pneumonia. Effective analgesia improves respiratory function. PRN regimes rely on the patient requesting analgesia when in pain and there may be considerable time delay between request and administration. In addition peak plasma levels obtained by IM opiod injections and the time taken to reach these levels varies between patients. The standard regime is therefore optimal for only a small number of patients. The plasma concentrations of opiods required to provide effective analgesia may vary up to fourfold between patients."
others,338,Which is the most common presenting feature of porphyria cutanea tarda?,Acute blistering crises affecting the trunk and limbs,Acute redness and swelling following sun exposure,Erythroderma,Generalised hypertrichosis,"Skin fragility and blistering affecting the hands, face and scalp",E,"Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is a term that encompasses a group of related disorders, all of which arise from deficient activity of the haeme-synthetic enzyme uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (URO-D) in the liver. The porphyrins produced in PCT are photoactive molecules that absorb light energy strongly in the visible violet spectrum. Photoexcited porphyrins in the skin mediate oxidative damage to biomolecular targets, causing cutaneous photosensitivity reactions. The most common presenting sign of PCT is fragility of sun exposed skin after mechanical trauma, leading to erosions and bullae, worst on dorsal hands, forearms, and face."
others,339,"Which of the following best describes a solid, circumscribed elevation which is 7mm in diameter?",Papule,Pustule,Macule,Plaque,Nodule,E,"Nodules are solid, elevated lesions which are greater than 5mm and the greater part is beneath the skin. A papule is a small circumscribed elevated lesion. A pustule contains pus. A plaque is a flat topped palpable lesion and a macule is a flat lesion."
others,340,Which of the following can be used for skin disinfection?,Alcoholic solution of chlorhexidine,Glutaraldehyde,Hydrogen peroxide,Phenol,Quaternary ammonium compounds,A,"Although not a phenol compound, chlorhexidine is similar in structure and function and has no reported toxic effects. It is often used as an alternative in soaps, and on skin and mucous membranes. Glutaraldehyde is a compound used especially in tanning leather and in the fixation of biological tissues. Three per cent H2O2 is used for wound debridement but higher concentrations cause skin irritation. Phenol is famous as the disinfectant first used by Joseph Lister in the 1880s in antiseptic surgery. It is however very corrosive to human tissues and today is usually the starting point for the synthesis of derivatives. Quaternary ammonium compounds are powerful disinfectants with additional detergent action, not to be used on skin."
others,341,Which of the following concerning leg ulcers is correct?,Diuretics have been shown to improve ulcer healing when associated with oedema,"In diabetic ulcers, the dressing should be left in situ for no more than one week",Large gravitational ulcers are always painful,Treating superficial infection with antibiotics has been shown to be beneficial in reducing ulcer spread.,Ulcers caused by arterial disease are typically treated by compression bandaging,B,"Diuretics may reduce oedema but have not been demonstrated per se to reduce healing time. Gravitational ulcers are not usually painful. If there are no obvious features of surrounding cellulitis, antibiotic therapy is usually unnecessary and has not been shown to improve healing in superficial infection or spread which is common in ulceration."
others,342,Which of the following concerning pityriasis rosea is correct?,It is characterised by flat scaly patches,It is due to a fungal infection,It is frequently associated with oro-genital itching,May be preceded by intense itching,Tends to recur after apparent cure,A,"Pityriasis rosea is a rash that can occur at any age, but it occurs most commonly in people between the ages of 10 and 35 years. It may be set off by a viral infection but does not appear to be contagious; herpes viruses 6 and 7 have most often been associated with pityriasis rosea. It is not caused by a fungus. It is not related to foods, medicines, or stress. It most often affects teenagers or young adults. The condition often begins as a large single pink patch on the chest or back. This patch may be scaly and is called a 'herald' or 'mother' patch. Within a week or two, more pink patches, sometimes hundreds of them, appear on the body and on the arms and legs. Patches may also occur on the neck, and though rare, the face. The oval patches follow the line of the ribs like a fir tree. They have a dry surface and may have an inner circlet of scaling."
others,343,Which of the following drugs would improve prognosis in heart failure?,ACE inhibitors,Atenolol,Digoxin,Furosemide,Nitrates,A,"Furosemide is effective in improving symptoms secondary to volume overload, it does not improve prognosis. However, the randomised Aldactone evaluation study (RALES) trial has shown 30% reduction in mortality when spironolactone was added to conventional treatment. Atenolol has not been evaluated in the management of heart failure. Carvedilol, metoprolol and bisoprolol have been proven through trials to improve prognosis in heart failure. Trials showed digoxin neither increased nor decreased total cardiovascular mortality because reduction in deaths due to progressive heart failure was balanced by an increase in deaths due to ischaemia and arrhythmia as a result of digoxin therapy. Hydralazine and isosorbide nitrate in combination have been shown to be as effective as ACE inhibitors for improving symptoms, but these drugs do not alter prognosis."
others,344,Which of the following helps to prevent the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) in trauma patients?,Avoiding the use of propofol for ICU sedation,Delaying fracture fixation until the patient has been haemodynamically stable for 48 hours,Early nasogastric feeding,Long term use of broad spectrum antibiotics,Selective decontamination of the digestive tract,C,"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is defined as the presence of altered organ function in an acutely ill patient such that homeostasis cannot be maintained without intervention^1. It is a frequent complication of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. Enteral feeding via a gastric (NG) tube, should be started as soon as possible in all trauma patients. In the absence of enteral nutrition, the gut mucosa atrophies and bacteria may 'translocate', which is thought to be the cause of sepsis and MODS. Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) may reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection, but there is little evidence to suggest that it reduces the incidence of MODS. The use of broad spectrum antibiotics will merely encourage the development of resistant bacteria. Fractures should be stabilised as soon as possible. Using propofol for long term sedation on the ICU is no longer popular; however this is not associated with the development of MODS. "
others,345,Which of the following is a feature of hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia?,A good response to oestrogen therapy,Cerebral arteriovenous malformations,GI haemorrhage is the usual presenting feature,"Telangiectasia of the mucous membranes, but not the skin",Tendency of lesions to become less obvious with age,B,"Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a multisystem vascular dysplasia characterised by the presence of multiple arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) that lack intervening capillaries and result in direct connections between arteries and veins. Small AVMs, called telangiectases, close to the surface of skin and mucous membranes often rupture and bleed. It is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. The most common clinical manifestations of HHT are spontaneous and recurrent epistaxis and multiple telangiectases which commonly appear on the lips, face, tongue, or hands in adulthood. A minority of individuals with HHT have symptomatic gastrointestinal bleeding, which most commonly begins after age 50 years. Large AVMs often cause symptoms when they occur in the brain or lung; complications from bleeding or shunting may be sudden and catastrophic. It is estimated at least 30% of HHT patients have pulmonary involvement, 30% hepatic involvement, and 10-20% cerebral involvement. The manifestations of HHT generally develop with age and are usually not present at birth. Epistaxis is usually the earliest sign of disease, often occurring in childhood. Pulmonary AVMs can become apparent from puberty. By the age of 16 years, 71% of patients will have developed signs of HHT, rising to over 90% by 40 years. The Curacao criteria can be used to aid diagnosis: The diagnosis is:  'definite' if three criteria are present 'possible' or 'suspected' if two criteria are present, or 'unlikely' if fewer than two criteria are present.  Criteria are:  epistaxis: spontaneous, recurrent nose bleeds telangiectases: multiple, characteristic sites (lips, oral cavity, fingers, nose) visceral lesions, such as gastrointestinal telangiectasia, pulmonary AVM, hepatic AVM, cerebral AVM, spinal AVM, and family history of a first-degree relative with HHT.  Cerebral involvement can be in the form of telangiectasias, cerebral AVMs, aneurysms, or cavernous angiomas. Cerebral AVMs are thought to affect 10% of patients and can result in headaches, seizures, surrounding ischaemia (steal), or haemorrhage. These lead to significant mortality and morbidity. Management of epistaxis and gastrointestinal haemorrhage should be symptomatic initially. Whilst it is generally regarded that pulmonary AVMs should be screened for (and treated with prophylactic antibiotics and embolisation), screening for cerebral and hepatic AVMs remains controversial and is not currently offered in the UK. Oestrogen therapy is sometimes advocated but its efficacy is unclear. It may be beneficial in heavily transfusion dependent patients. "
others,346,Which of the following is a method of sterilisation?,Alpha irradiation,Cellulose filtration,Dry heat at 134°C for 3 minutes,Moist heat at 121°C for 15 minutes,Steam at 80°C and sub-atmospheric pressure,B,"Moist heat (e.g. autoclave) is a method of sterilisation, and the process kills all organisms and spores. It should be applied at 122°C at 1 atm for 30 minutes, 126°C at 1.5 atm for 10 minutes, or 134°C at 2 atm for 3 minutes to sterilise non-heat sensitive surgical instruments. Steam is used to increase the temperature, so dry heat needs to be at a higher temperature for a longer time, e.g. 160°C for 1 hour, to have a similar effect to moist heat. Dry heat is used to sterilise glassware and powders. Steam at low pressure and 80°C will only disinfect instruments, and it does not destroy spores. The addition of formaldehyde will cause sterilisation, and is used to sterilise heat sensitive equipment such as cannulae. Cellulose filtration is used to sterilise heat sensitive fluids, but it may not remove viral particles."
others,347,Which of the following is a recognised association of coeliac disease?,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Gastric carcinoma,Gastrointestinal hamartomas,Rheumatoid arthitis,Type 2 diabetes,A,"Coeliac disease is associated with dermatitis herpetiformis, autoimmune thyroid disease, type 1 diabetes (not type 2) and osteoporosis. Oesophageal carcinoma is associated with coeliac disease, probably due to the malabsorption syndrome that leads to multiple nutritional deficiencies. There is an association with gastrointestinal lymphomas and, less commonly, adenocarcinoma (most often in the jejunum). Gastrointestinal hamartomas are associated with the hereditary Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a disorder in which small bowel mucosal damage is the result of a permanent sensitivity to dietary gluten. The disorder does not present until gluten products have been introduced into the diet. Typically, the most common period of presentation is between six months and two years of age. Incidence is 1:10,000 live births. Three components interact in the pathogenesis:  Toxicity of certain cereals Genetic predisposition, and Environmental factors.  The disorder develops only after chronic dietary exposure to the protein gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, oats, and barley. The activity of gluten resides in the gliadin fraction which contains certain repetitious amino acid sequences (motifs) that lead to sensitisation of lamina propria lymphocytes. The immunologic response to gluten results in villus atrophy, crypt hyperplasia, and damage to the surface epithelium in the small bowel. The injury is greatest in the proximal small bowel and extends distally for a variable distance. The mode of presentation is variable; the majority present with diarrhoea. Children can have failure to thrive or vomiting as the only manifestation. Perhaps as many as 10% of children referred to endocrinologists for growth retardation without an endocrine or overt gastrointestinal disorder have gluten sensitivity. Anorexia is common and may be the major cause of weight loss or lack of weight gain. Infants with gluten-sensitive enteropathy are often, but not always, clingy, irritable, unhappy children who are difficult to comfort. In contrast to infants with cystic fibrosis, they are not interested in food, although this is not always the case. Pallor and abdominal distension are common. Large, bulky stools suggestive of constipation have been described in some children with this condition. Digital clubbing can occur. There is an increased prevalence of gluten-sensitive enteropathy in children with selective IgA deficiency or diabetes mellitus compared to unaffected children. Lymphocytic gastritis occurs in a rare child with gluten-sensitive enteropathy. The most useful screening test for malabsorption is a microscopic examination of stool for fat. The two antibody screening tests are: tissue transglutamine antibody (tTGA) and endomysial antibody (EMA). Other initial studies should include a complete blood count, serum albumin, and serum immunoglobulin levels. Nutrients that may be measured in blood include:  Iron, the level of which depends on transferrin concentration as well as on absorption Folic acid, the red cell concentration being a more accurate reflection of nutritional status than the serum concentration Calcium and magnesium Vitamin D and its metabolites Vitamin A, and Vitamin B12."
others,348,Which of the following is a recognised cause of finger clubbing?,Carcinoid tumour,Chronic pancreatitis,Ileo-caecal tuberculosis,Iron deficiency anaemia,Liver cirrhosis,E,"Causes of clubbing may be categorised into:  Respiratory (cystic fibrosis, mesothelioma, bronchiectasis, fibrosis, lung carcinoma) Gastroenterological (lymphoma, inflammatory bowel disease, cirrhosis) Cardiac (cyanotic heart disease, myxoma, bacterial endocarditis).  Iron deficiency anaemia causes koilonychia."
others,349,Which of the following is a recognised complication of invasive arterial pressure measurement in an adult?,Anticoagulation,Compartment syndrome,Fluid overload,Pneumothorax,False aneurysm formation,E,"Complications of arterial cannulation may include:  Haematoma formation Distal ischaemia Infection Embolisation False aneurysm Arteriovenous fistula, and Blood loss.  Flush volumes must be limited in children, otherwise fluid overload may occur. Replacing the pressure bag with a syringe pump may provide some protection against such an occurrence."
others,350,Which of the following is aggravated by exposure to sunlight?,Acne vulgaris ,Acute intermittent porphyria,Pellagra ,Pseudoxanthoma elasticum,Psoriasis,C,Exacerbation or localisation of other dermatoses is characteristic of:  Pellagra Hartnup's disease Lupus erythematosus Darier's disease Rosacea Scleroderma Actinic lichen planus Lymphocytoma.  Acne vulgaris and psoriasis are often improved with sunlight.  Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is not affect by sunlight.  Porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT) is affected by sunlight.
others,351,Which of the following is an effective management for glue ear?,Decongestants,Long term antibiotics,Low power hearing aid,Prophylactic nocturnal antibiotics,Steroid ear drops,C,"The majority of cases of glue ear will resolve spontaneously with time, and in those children with occasional self-limiting episodes this probably has minimal influence on speech and language. Persistent severe otitis media may result in significant delay in language acquisition, behavioural disturbances, and sometimes disturbances of balance. Grommet insertion is effective while the grommets remain patent. Long term benefits are much less certain. The majority of patients will recover with conservative treatment. Decongestants, antibiotics and steroids are ineffective. A low power hearing aid may be helpful for the most severely affected children. Usually, once the parents have had the problem explained to them they make allowances for the decreased hearing and can communicate more effectively."
others,352,Which of the following is associated with cavitation on the chest x ray?,Klebsiella pneumonia,Legionnaires' disease,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Sarcoidosis,Viral pneumonia,A,"Cavitating lesions are caused by:  Squamous cell carcinoma Abscess (Staph. aureus, Klebsiella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) Lymphoma Mycobacerium tuberculosis Rheumatoid nodule Pulmonary infarction, or Granulomatosis with polyangiitis."
others,353,Which of the following is commonly associated with psoriasis?,Angular stomatitis,Koebner phenomenon,Optic neuritis,Response to chloroquine,Scarring alopecia,B,"Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disorder most commonly characterised by erythematous, sharply demarcated papules and rounded plaques covered by silvery scales. Diagnosis is usually clinical and skin biopsy is rarely required to confirm psoriasis. New lesions often appear at sites of injury or trauma (Koebner phenomenon), which typically occurs one to two weeks after the skin has been damaged. Psoriasis can be associated with an anterior uveitis, but optic neuritis is not a recognised complication. Angular stomatitis describes erythema and fissuring of the skin adjacent to the angle of the mouth. The most common cause is Candida infection, but it is also associated with allergy, seborrhoeic dermatitis, vitamin B deficiencies, and iron deficiency. It is not commonly described in association with psoriasis. The scalp is often involved in psoriasis, especially in children and adolescents. Most commonly, it causes a telogen effluvium, that is, the hair follicles are forced into the telogen resting stage.  It is rare for psoriasis to cause a scarring alopecia. Up to 30% of patients with chronic plaque psoriasis may be affected by an arthropathy. This can range from mild distal interphalangeal joint involvement with nail pitting to severe arthritis mutilans. Whilst the exact cause is unknown, psoriasis has a strong genetic basis. European populations are commonly affected, and there are two peaks of incidence at 16-22 years and 57-60 years. Males and females are equally affected. External factors such as infection, stress, and medication may exacerbate psoriasis. Some of the common medications associated with triggering or worsening psoriasis include lithium, gold salts, beta blockers, and antimalarials (including chloroquine). "
others,354,Which of the following is correct in malignant hyperpyrexia?,A mortality rate of 20% may be expected,Elevation of serum creatine kinase and myoglobinuria is diagnostic,Muscle biopsy may be histologically normal ,"The only available specific treatment is sodium dantrolene, which has a neutral pH",The predisposing gene is thought to be on chromosome 9 ,C,"Malignant hyperpyrexia (MH) is characterised by increased temperature and muscle rigidity during anaesthesia, which results from abnormal skeletal muscle contraction and increased metabolism. The predisposing gene is thought to be on chromosome 19, close to the gene for the ryanodine/dihydropyridine receptor complex. Known triggering agents include the volatile anaesthetic agents and suxamethonium. Patients show different sensitivity to the triggering agents and the reaction can be delayed by several hours. Intravenous dantrolene (up to 10 mg/kg) is the only available specific treatment and care must be taken when administering as the solution has a pH of 9-10. The prognosis of malignant hyperpyrexia is good when the appropriate treatment is instigated early, mortality being less than 5% (prior to dantrolene the mortality was 80%). Serum creatine kinase elevation and myoglobinuria are suggestive but not diagnostic of MH. Myoglobin and creatine kinase are both known to increase after giving suxamethonium to normal patients. Contracture tests using caffeine and halothane are the investigations of choice. Muscle biopsies may appear histologically normal."
others,355,Which of the following is correct of Fournier's gangrene?,Is diagnosed by acute cellulitis with crepitations,Is usually caused by two synergistic infective organisms,Rapidly involves the testes,Responds rapidly to aggressive systemic antibiotics if given early,The penis is spared,A,"Fournier's gangrene is a severe synergistic infection arising in the scrotum or perianal tissues and requires radical debridement of the subcutaneous tissues. It is a polymicrobial infection with an average of four isolates per case.  E. coli is the predominant aerobe and Bacteroides the most common anaerobe. Other organisms involved include Proteus, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Streptococcus and Clostridium. Crepitation precedes gangrene by 12 hours. The testes are not involved due to their proximal blood supply and separation from the fascia by the tunica vaginalis. The spreading gangrene rapidly involves the penis. The condition usually occurs in older men who have recently undergone urological or perianal surgery. Diabetes, morbid obesity, haematological malignancy, alcoholism, malnutrition, and HIV infection are predisposing factors."
others,356,Which of the following is correct of lymphoedema praecox?,Is due to an acquired abnormality of lymphatics,Is more common in post-menopausal women,Leads to gangrene of the foot and toes in longstanding cases,May be associated with cutaneous vesicles,Usually leads to bilateral leg swelling,D,"Lymphoedema praecox is an example of a primary lymphoedema and is caused by a congenital abnormality or absence of the lymphatics. It has a peak age of onset between 10-30 years and has a clear genetic predisposition in some patients. This condition is more common in females and is seen shortly after menarche. In the majority of the patients the condition is more likely to be unilateral. In some instances the patients may develop numerous vesicles in the skin which may leak clear lymph or, occasionally chyle. It does not lead to gangrene in longstanding cases."
others,357,Which of the following is correct regarding Idiopathic angio-oedema?,It does not respond to oral antihistamines,It has a higher mortality than hereditary angio-oedema,It is less common than hereditary angio-oedema,It is often associated with urticaria,It requires treatment with intramuscular epinephrine for the majority of attacks,E,Treatment of Idiopathic angio-oedema involves intramuscular adrenaline with antihistamines and steroids. Hereditary angio-oedema has a high mortality of up to 30% if not treated adequately. Angio-oedema is usually due to (atopic or non-atopic) allergy. Hereditary angio-oedema is rare. Urticaria does not usually occur in this condition. There is often a danger of airways obstruction which responds to adrenaline in cases of allergy.
others,358,Which of the following is correct regarding near drowning in the child?,Carries a worse prognosis in salt water immersion,Is rarely associated with cervical spine injury,Requires core rewarming if the core temperature is below 34°C,Results in apnoea and tachycardia on initial immersion,Survival chances are increased if the rectal temperature on arrival is above 33°C,C,"This is a difficult subject as the published management is not absolutely consistent. On initial immersion the diving reflex occurs, which results in apnoea and bradycardia. Later, as apnoea continues hypoxia results, causing tachycardia, increase in blood pressure and acidosis. Rapid cooling of the organs to below 33°C is protective and associated with a better prognosis. Because of reduced body fat, children (and some men) may cool faster in icy water and may have a better prognosis. The brain has hypoxic resistance at 30°C and below. Immersion in salt or fresh water carries the same prognosis. Cervical spine injury should be suspected in all cases of near drowning, as the incidence of this associated injury is high, especially in diving accidents. Passive external rewarming (removal of wet clothing, blankets) is sufficient for core temperatures of 34°C or above but for lower core temperature, core rewarming becomes necessary. Core rewarming can include warm intravenous fluids and ventilator gases, as well as gastric, bladder, peritoneal, pleural, pericardial lavage, and extracorporeal warming. Active external warming (heaters, warming blankets) has the risk of causing peripheral vasodilatation and increasing the acidosis. It is the core temperature that matters. Efforts to resuscitate should be continued until the core temperature is at least 32-34°C."
others,359,Which of the following is correct regarding primary blast injury?,Is common in people who are a long distance from the explosion,Results in amaurosis fugax,Results in crush injuries,Results in hollow viscera injury only,The eardrum may be perforated,E,"Injury from an explosive device results from:  the blast wave the blast wind fragmentation flash burns crush, and psychological injuries.  The blast wave comes from the rapidly rising air pressure resulting from the expanding sphere of hot gases (explosion). Initial injury results from contusions of the underlying solid organs from the initial body compression followed by disruption of tissues at the air/tissue interface (for example, lungs). Following this, injury results from shearing forces at tissue interfaces (for example, eye) and implosion of gas filled organs (for example, intestines, middle ear). The blast wave pressure is inversely proportional to the distance cubed. Amaurosis fugax results from embolisation into the optic artery and is associated with carotid artery stenosis. Crush injuries usually result from falling masonry following the initial explosion."
others,360,Which of the following is NOT a feature of cannabinoids?,9-tetrahydrocannabinol is the active constituent of the resin,Bioavailability after oral administration is about 80%,Inhibits eicosanoid synthesis,Lowers intraocular pressure,Naloxone blocks the antinociceptive actions of cannabinoids,B,"Cannabinoids are derived from the resin of cannabis sativa, and 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC) is its most important pharmacologically active constituent. Oral bioavailability of THC, whether given in the pure form or as THC in marijuana, is low and extremely variable, ranging between 5% and 20%, with effects occurring 0.5-3 hours later. Bioavailability of THC in a marijuana cigarette or pipe also rarely exceeds 10-20%. Naloxone and other opioid receptor antagonists block the analgesic actions of cannabinoids. Synthetic cannabinoids reduce arachidonic acid-induced inflammation by inhibiting eicosanoid production."
others,361,Which of the following is the characteristic finding for cytomegalovirus retinitis?,Cotton wool spots,Anisocoria,Macular oedema,Conjunctival injection,Retinal haemorrhages,E,"CMV retinitis presents with a single white lesion that increase in size along the retinal vessels and are surrounded by haemorrhages. They are similar to cotton wool spots in appearance, but cotton wool spots are usually multiple and resolve in time. A red conjunctiva does not suggest CMV and there is no pupil difference."
others,362,Which of the following is true concerning high risk patients?,Wearing double gloves is mandatory,They are at high risk of being MRSA positive,They should be placed at the end of an operating list to avoid infecting any subsequent patients,They should have their skin cleaned at least four times with chlorhexidine,Those infected with hepatitis B virus can transmit the virus by splash contamination into the operator's conjunctiva,E,"Stating that a patient is high-risk allows the surgeon to modify their technique to avoid sharp injuries. High-risk patients do not pose a risk of infection to subsequent patients on the operating list; placing them last is discriminatory. The patient's skin is cleaned in the normal way. Eye protection must always be worn when operating on a high risk patient. Wearing two pairs of the surgeon's usual size gloves will constrict the blood flow to the fingers and reduce dexterity. Usually, a second pair, half a size larger than normal, is worn on the inside or outside (an individual choice based on experience but usually on the inside). This advisable but not mandatory. There is no evidence that dexterity is reduced once the surgeon gets used to double gloving. As contamination risk is greatly reduced it may be considered that double gloving should be routine."
others,363,Which of the following is true concerning the pleura?,Extends to the under surface of the first rib,Is derived from the embryonic ectodermal germ layer,The blood supply of the visceral pleura is from the intercostal arteries,The innervation of the parietal layer is by the phrenic nerves,The pleural sac on the left is not in contact with the right sac posteriorly,E,"The pleura develops from the embryonic coelomic lining derived from lateral plate mesoderm which splits into parietal and visceral components. The parietal layer lines the thoracic wall which includes the rib cage, vertebrae and diaphragm and the visceral layer invests the lobes of the lungs. The dome of the pleura extends about 2.5 cm above the medial end of the clavicle. Each pleural sac is a closed cavity lined by a serous membrane which invaginates into the lung. The two pleural sacs only make contact behind the upper half of the sternal body. The diaphragmatic pleura is supplied by the phrenic nerves over the domes and the intercostal nerves over the periphery. The blood supply of the visceral pleura is derived from the bronchial and pulmonary arteries. The parietal pleura is supplied by the intercostal, internal thoracic and musculophrenic arteries."
others,364,Which of the following is true in a patient who has sustained severe burns?,Aminoglycoside antibiotics have a prolonged half life in the body,Bacterial contamination of a wound swab is an indication to start systemic antibiotics,Sepsis is an uncommon cause of death,The burn injury depresses immunity,The level of T suppressor cells is decreased,D,"Thermal injury depresses immunity, but the exact mechanisms have not been yet been fully explained. However, diminished neutrophil chemotaxis, impaired phagocytic activity and increased numbers of T suppressor cells (not decreased) have all been demonstrated. Sepsis and multiple organ failure (initiated by bacterial translocation from the gut, infection and the release of mediators from dead tissue) are the leading causes of death. Systemic antibiotics should only be prescribed if a burn wound infection is confirmed (by blood cultures, and examination of wound biopsies). Bacterial contamination of a burn wound is generally not an indication to administer systemic antibiotics. Aminoglycoside antibiotics have shortened half lives (not lengthened), due to increased clearance and ongoing fluid losses."
others,365,Which of the following is true in breast cancer?,Mutations of the p53 gene are protective,The susceptibility gene BRCA1 confers a risk of over 95% by age 70,The susceptibility gene BRCA2 decreases the risk of male breast cancer,There is a recognised association with ataxia telangiectasia,Up to 50% of new cases have an inherited basis,D,"Mutations of the p53 gene on chromosome 17p12 are implicated in some inherited and also sporadic forms of breast cancer. BRCA1 confers a risk of 83% for breast cancer and 63% for ovarian cancer. There is a modest increase in risk for colon and prostate. The BRCA1 gene is on chromosome 17q21. BCRA2 confers the same risk as BRCA1 for breast cancer in women and is less involved in ovarian cancer. The BRCA2 gene is on chromosome 13q12. The ataxia telangiectasia (AT) gene on chromosome 11q22 is thought to play an important role in breast cancer, accounting for up to 13% cases in some reports. In the United Kingdom up to 10% of new cases have an inherited basis which is equivalent to over 1,000 women per year. "
others,366,Which of the following is true of cutaneous anthrax?,Causes a black eschar which overlies pus,Is very likely to occur in subjects exposed to anthrax spores,Lesions are associated with marked oedema,Lesions are usually painful and tender,Mortality is approximately 20% despite antibiotic therapy,C,"Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis a Gram positive rod. Cutaneous anthrax is caused by direct contact of the bacteria into an open wound (usually touching an infected animal). Cutaneous anthrax is associated with a black eschar without pus, tends to be painless and to have widespread oedema. Without antibiotics, mortality is of the order of 20%, but with antibiotics, mortality is low, which contrasts with pulmonary anthrax. "
others,367,Which of the following is true of malignant melanoma?,Accounts for 60% of skin cancer deaths,Affects females more frequently than males,Is associated with infra-red light exposure,Is more common in people with dark skin,May develop in a pre-existing benign naevus,E,"As with all skin cancers, malignant melanoma is associated with exposure to UV light, and the sex incidence is roughly equal. Features of malignant change within a pre-existing naevus include:  Change in size Change in colour Ulceration Crusting Itching Bleeding, and The appearance of satellite lesions.  It is more common with fair skin, in red heads and people of Celtic origin. Men often present with lesions affecting the trunk, and women with lesions affecting the legs. Malignant melanoma accounts for almost all skin cancer deaths."
others,368,Which of the following is true of malignant melanoma?,An increased incidence has been shown in the relatives of patients with a melanoma,People with dark hair and eyes are at greater risk,Survival rates are independent of tumour thickness,The incidence is remaining stationary,Treatment is based on clinical symptoms,A,"Incidence of malignant melanomas is increasing rapidly; an increased incidence has been shown in the relatives of patients with a melanoma. Unfavourable sites include the scalp, hands, feet, and mucous membranes. Males and older patients have a poorer prognosis. The thinner the lesion, the greater the chances of survival. Treatment of malignant melanomas depends upon staging."
others,369,Which of the following is true of the management of trauma patients?,Blind nasal intubation is a safe technique in patients with a cervical spine injury,Nasal intubation should be performed on head injured patients that require post-operative ventilation on ICU,Patients intoxicated with alcohol have a lower peri-operative morbidity than non-intoxicated patients,Surgery on trauma patients should never be delayed,Suxamethonium should not be used within two weeks following an extensive burn injury,E,"Studies have demonstrated that blind nasal intubation carries more risk of dislocation of fractured vertebrae than when performed using a laryngoscope. Manual in-line stabilisation of the head and neck must be maintained whenever the cervical collar/sandbags or tape are removed, in order to improve the view at laryngoscopy. The availability of a gum elastic bougie and other difficult intubation equipment should always be confirmed. Patients who require post-operative ventilation do not need to have a nasal endotracheal tube. Nasal intubation has a higher failure rate than oral intubation, and potentially causes more damage. It is also contraindicated when a basal skull fracture exists. Alcohol intoxication:  Increases the risk of vomiting and aspiration Causes vasodilatation and cooling Increases the risk of arrhythmias, and Potentiates the effect of anaesthetic drugs.  Emergency surgery carries a higher risk than the same operation performed electively. Many elderly patients with hip fractures are frequently operated on during normal working hours, days after the injury. Patients with extensive burns have an increased number of extrajunctional acetylcholine receptors. Suxamethonium should be avoided in burns patients from two hours after the injury to two years. Giving suxamethonium to these patients may lead to an increased release of potassium, causing arrhythmias and may lead to cardiac arrest."
others,370,Which of the following is true of the Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome?,Is associated with excessive gastrin secretion after calcium infusion,Is associated with hypothyroidism,Is diagnosed by the demonstration of raised gastrin levels and achlorydia,More commonly results from primary antral G cell hyperplasia than a pancreatic adenoma,Results in gastric mucosal atrophy,A,ZE syndrome is associated with hypergastrinaemia and is usually due to a neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas. It often manifests as recurrent peptic ulceration which endoscopically may extend to the jejunum. It is associated with hyperparathyroidism as part of the MEN type 1 syndrome. Approximately 10% are malignant.
others,371,Which of the following is true of toxic shock syndrome?,Can lead to a rise in haemoglobin,Cerebral oedema is a recognised early complication,Commonly occurs when burns affected greater than15-20% total body surface area,Is associated with a diffuse macular rash and diarrhoea,Is caused by Streptococcus faecalis,D,"This alarming syndrome could result even from small scalds in young children. The onset is sudden with:  vomiting diarrhoea temperature greater than 40°C diffuse macular rash which later desquamates tachypnoea, and oliguria.  These signs usually develop on the third or fourth day after sustaining the scald/burn and are associated with a drop in haemoglobin and white cell count. It is caused due to a toxin produced by Staphylococcus aureus phage type 29/52. Late complications include irritability, cerebral oedema, convulsions and coma. Treatment should be prompt with control of temperature by vasodilatation, reduction of cerebral oedema, if necessary by hyperventilation, and the administration of whole blood, immunoglobulins and antibiotics."
others,372,Which of the following is true regarding a thyroglossal cyst?,Contains lymphoid tissue,Is a pre-malignant condition,Is commonly located in a suprahyoid position,Is formed after the failed disintegration of the pharyngobranchial duct,Usually presents in patients of middle age,A,The majority of thyroglossal cysts (60%) typically present as midline swelling that moves with swallowing or on protruding the tongue. They are formed after the failed disintegration of the thyroglossal duct and are most commonly located in a subhyoid position. The cysts may become infected and cause chronic discharge. Infected cysts are treated by needle aspiration and antimicrobials. The presence of lymphoid tissue in the wall renders the cysts susceptible to infection.
others,373,Which of the following is true regarding adult patients with burns?,Acid burns should be neutralised with alkaline solution,Full thickness burns are painless,Superficial partial thickness burns have blisters,The anterior trunk is 9% of body surface area,"The half-life of carboxyhaemoglobin, in 100% oxygen, is four hours",B,"Chemical burns should be brushed off (if dry substance) and irrigated. Using an alkaline substance to neutralise the acid may result in an exothermic reaction (generating heat), which could exacerbate the injury. Superficial partial thickness burns are painful and erythematous, deep partial thickness burns are blistered and very painful, and full thickness burns are white, leathery and painless. The anterior trunk comprises 13% of body surface area (Lund and Browder chart). The 'rule of nines' is just a simple approximation. The half-life of carboxyhaemoglobin in 100% oxygen is approximately 30 minutes; in air it is four hours."
others,374,Which of the following is true regarding an oesophageal intubation?,Can be excluded if the arytenoids are anterior to the endotracheal tube,Cannot be reliably detected using a stethoscope,"Is highly probable, if the oxygen saturation falls immediately after a rapid sequence induction","Is unlikely, if resistance is encountered on withdrawing the plunger of an oesophageal detector device","Is unlikely, if the coloured membrane in a Fenem carbon dioxide detector is purple",B,"If the arytenoids cartilages are seen posterior to the endotracheal tube (not anterior), then an oesophageal intubation is unlikely. If the arytenoids are anterior to the endotracheal tube (ETT), then the tube is in the oesophagus. Auscultation of the lung fields does not always detect an oesophageal intubation. Transmitted breath sounds can mimic ventilation of the lungs, and breath sounds in patients with emphysema or obesity may be inaudible. Pre-oxygenating patients prior to a rapid sequence induction reduces the incidence of desaturation, and oxygen saturation can remain normal for up to a few minutes. An immediate fall in oxygen saturation (particularly in patients with a normal metabolic rate) is unlikely, even with an oesophageal intubation. An oesophageal detector device is a 60 ml catheter tip syringe attached to a normal catheter mount, which has a 15 mm tracheal tube connector fitted to the distal end. When the endotracheal tube is in the trachea, there should be no resistance on withdrawing the plunger of the syringe, and if it is in the oesophagus, then resistance will be felt on withdrawing the plunger. Attempting to aspirate air from an endotracheal tube situated in the oesophagus causes the walls to collapse around the tube, occluding the lumen and providing resistance to withdrawing the plunger. The Fenem carbon dioxide detector device is inserted between the ETT and the catheter mount, and provides rapid breath-by-breath monitoring. It has a coloured membrane that is usually purple in colour (indicating that less than0.3% carbon dioxide is present). In a tracheal intubation, the membrane changes from purple to yellow as the concentration of carbon dioxide increases with exhalation, returning to purple with inspiration. In an oesophageal intubation it remains purple."
others,375,Which of the following is true regarding antibiotics?,Amphotericin B is not significantly protein bound,Clarithromycin is the most suitable antibiotic in a patient with severe cellultis who is allergic to penicillin,Lipid formulations of amphotericin B are more nephrotoxic than conventional amphotericin B,Penicillin is a suitable antibiotic in treating infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa,The quinolones are RNA gyrase inhibitors,B,Amphotericin B is highly protein bound and penetrates body tissues poorly. The nephrotoxicity is reduced in lipid formulations of amphotericin B. Ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin are both quinolones which prevent bacterial DNA supercoiling by their action on DNA gyrase. They are suitable antibiotics in treating infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. For severe cellulitis in a patient allergic to penicillin (so you cannot give the standard treatment of flucloxacillin 1 g IV qds and benzyl penicillin 1.2 g IV qds) clarithromycin 500 mg IV bd is the best choice. Clarithromycin is a Macrolid that inhibits protein synthesis. Penicillines act by inhibiting cell wall synthesis
others,376,Which of the following is true regarding asbestos exposure?,Causes mesothelioma 10-12 years after initial exposure,Is rarely associated with a productive cough,May present with bowel obstruction with prolonged exposure,Produces increased radiolucency on plain chest radiography,Usually results in asbestosis if exposed for six years or more,C,"Asbestosis is chronic lung disease caused by long term exposure to asbestos. The disease usually occurs in people who have had exposure to asbestos for 15 years or more. Prolonged exposure increases the risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma and non-malignant lung and pleural disorders. Mesothelioma is a cancer affecting the lining pleura and the peritoneum, and the majority of mesotheliomas are caused by exposure to asbestos. They are usually diagnosed 30 years or more after the initial exposure to asbestos. It is more common in men than in women. Patients present with:  Dyspnoea Persistent and productive cough Tightness in the chest Chest pain Loss of appetite, and Loss of weight.  Plain chest radiography may reveal extensive scarring in the lung and obliteration of the costophrenic angle due to pleural effusion. Patients who have developed peritoneal mesothelioma may present with:  Abdominal pain Ascites Nausea or vomiting Weight loss, or Signs and symptoms of bowel obstruction."
others,377,Which of the following is true regarding cleft lip and palate?,Genetic influence is less significant in combined cleft lip and palate,Has a higher incidence among the black population,"Has an incidence of one in 8,000 live births",Isolated cleft palate is less common than isolated cleft lip,The Pierre Robin sequence has the highest incidence of cleft palate.,E,"The incidence of cleft lip and palate is one in 600 live births, and 1:1000 live births for isolated cleft palate. The incidence increases in east Asian groups (1:500) and decreases in the black population (1:2000). The highest incidence reported for cleft lip and palate occurs in the Native American tribes of Montana, USA (1:276). The typical distribution of cleft types is:  Cleft lip alone - 15% Cleft lip and palate - 45% Isolated cleft palate - 40%.  Genetic influence is more significant in combined cleft lip and palate than cleft palate alone where environmental factors such as maternal epilepsy and drugs (for example, steroids, diazepam, phenytoin) exert a greater influence. Although most clefts of the lip and palate occur as an isolated deformity, the Pierre Robin sequence remains the most common condition in which cleft palate (not cleft lip) is found. This sequence comprises isolated cleft palate, retrognathia and a posteriorly displaced tongue (glossoptosis), which is associated with respiratory and feeding difficulties."
others,378,Which of the following is true regarding cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)?,Is the most common skin tumour seen in transplant patients,Metastases to bone most frequently,Occurs more frequently than basal cell carcinoma,Only occurs on sun exposed skin,Typically has rolled edges,A,"The most common dermatological malignancy is a basal cell carcinoma, with squamous being the next most common. But it is cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that is most common in immunocompromised transplant subjects. Squamous carcinomas can also occur in the lung, cervix and oesophagus. SCCs metastasise to regional lymph nodes and characteristically has an everted edge."
others,379,Which of the following is true regarding laryngoscopes?,A left-sided Macintosh blade in routinely used in adults,The McCoy laryngoscope is based on the standard Robertshaw's blade,The Polio blade is at an angle of 140 degrees to the handle,The tip of a Miller blade is designed to be placed into the vallecula,The Wisconsin and Seward are examples of straight blade laryngoscopes,E,"Laryngoscopes are used to perform direct laryngoscopy and can be classed as curved or straight, according to the shape of the blade. Straight blade laryngoscopes include the following types:  Miller Soper Wisconsin, and Seward.  They are designed to be advanced over the epiglottis which is then lifted in order to view the larynx. Straight blades are commonly used for intubating neonates and infants but can just as easily be used in adults. Curved bladed laryngoscopes (not straight) are designed so that the tip is placed into the vallecula; examples include the:  Macintosh Polio, and McCoy.  The standard Macintosh blade used in adults is the right-sided version. The left-sided blade may be used in patients with facial deformities that make the use of the standard blade difficult. The Macintosh Polio blade is at an angle of 120 degrees to the handle, and was designed to intubate patients in the iron lung. The McCoy laryngoscope (1993) is based on the standard Macintosh blade (not Robertshaw's), with a lever operated hinged tip, which can improve the view at laryngoscopy."
others,380,Which of the following is true regarding malignant melanoma?,Amelanotic type is more aggressive than the pigmented type,Is found exclusively in the skin,Is more common in males than females,Staging is according to the size of the tumour,"Transforms in common moles in about 1:10,000",A,"Malignant melanoma may be subungual, buccal, anal, and present on any mucosal surface, not merely in the dermis/epidermis. The incidence of malignant melanoma of the skin has been rising rapidly in the white populations around the world for several decades. Incidence rates in Great Britain increased from around 2 per 100,000 population for males and 3 per 100,000 population for females in 1971 to 7 and 9 per 100,000 population for men and women respectively in 1996, a threefold increase. Amelanotic malignant melanoma most commonly occurs in the setting of melanoma metastasis to the skin, presumably because of the inability of these poorly differentiated cancer cells to synthesise melanin pigment. More than 50% of cases are believed to arise de novo without a pre-existing pigmented lesion. Tumour size is only one of the criteria used in the AJCC 2009 Revised Melanoma Staging. Tumour thickness and mitotic rate (mitoses/mm^2) are the most important prognostic factors in the primary tumour. "
others,381,Which of the following is true regarding poisoning/overdose?,Aspirin causes acidosis due to hypoventilation,Chlormethiazole causes hyperthermia and hypertension,Ethylene glycol causes a metabolic alkalosis and renal failure,Methanol causes a metabolic acidosis with an increased anion gap,Phenobarbitone causes a metabolic acidosis,D,"Aspirin causes hyperventilation, which may result in a respiratory alkalosis; a massive overdose may cause a metabolic acidosis. Phenobarbitone and chlormethiazole both suppress the central nervous system causing:  Hypoventilation (and therefore a respiratory acidosis) Hypotension, and Hypothermia.  Ethylene glycol causes a metabolic acidosis. Methanol is metabolised to formaldehyde and formic acid, resulting in a metabolic acidosis."
others,382,Which of the following is true regarding preoperative starvation?,Chewing bubble gum immediately before a general anaesthetic is not contraindicated,Infants can have a bottle of milk up to two hours before a general anaesthetic,Patients scheduled for local anaesthesia procedures with sedation should follow the same instructions as general anaesthetic,Patients should not eat food up to eight hours prior to a general anaesthetic,Water and clear fluids can be consumed up to sixty minutes before a general anaesthetic,C,"Nil by mouth (NBM) policies may vary slightly between clinicians and hospitals. However, safe practice states that andquot;no solid food for six hours prior to a general anaesthetic or procedures involving sedationandquot; (not four hours). Chewing bubble gum or eating any type of confectionery should be avoided, as this promotes gastric acid secretion and increases the gastric volume. All types of milk are classed as solid food, and so the same six hour rule should be applied (not two hours), although three hours may be acceptable for breast milk. Water or clear fluids, can be consumed up to two hours pre-operatively (not one hour). Patients having regional or local anaesthetic (with sedation) procedures, should follow the same NBM policy as those scheduled for a general anaesthetic."

others,384,Which of the following may be associated with optic atrophy (OA)?,Anti-acetylcholinesterase antibodies,Intense iron deposition on liver biopsy,Low plasma caeruloplasmin,Red ragged fibres on muscle biopsy,XXY karyotype,D,"Red ragged fibres found in mitochondrial myopathy are found in Kearns-Sayre syndrome; mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS); and Leber's optic atrophy. Wilson's disease is associated with Kayser-Fleischer (KF) rings and myotonic dystrophy rather than myasthenia gravis is associated with OA. OA is not associated with Klinefelter's disease."
others,385,Which of the following may cause ulcers on the plantar surface of the foot?,Diabetes mellitus,Lead neuropathy,Sickle-cell disease,Varicose veins,Vasculitis,A,Plantar ulcers typically occur in association with sensory neuropathy (as in diabetes and alcohol). Lead causes a motor neuropathy
others,386,Which of the following ocular signs would you find in acne rosacea?,Ptosis,Swollen optic disc,Keratitis,Cataract,Uveitis,C,"Acne rosacea is characterised by facial redness, telangiectasia and papules. Ocular rosacea can occur which gives chronic conjunctivitis, blepharitis, chalazia and keratitis. Without treatment it can lead to corneal neovascularisation and eventual opacification."
others,387,Which of the following statements regarding psoriasis is correct?,1% of patients have associated psoriatic arthropathy,Guttate psoriasis is the most common form of the disease,Psoriasis is more common at lower geographical altitudes,Psoriatic arthropathy precedes cutaneous lesions in roughly 20% of cases,The prevalence in the United Kingdom is 10%,D,"The prevalence of psoriasis is reported as between 0.5 and 4.6%. For reasons which may be explained by the filtering of ultraviolet B (UVB) light, psoriasis is more common at higher altitudes. The commonest form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, making up approximately 80% of cases (guttate -10%, erythrodermic - 3%, pustular - 3%). Studies report:  a 5-42% prevalence of psoriatic arthropathy in patients with cutaneous psoriasis  arthropathy precedes cutaneous lesions in 20% cutaneous lesions precede joint disease in 60-70%, and they occur simultaneously in 10-20%."
others,388,Which of the following statements regarding psoriasis is most true?,Ciclosporin is ineffective in the treatment of psoriasis,Diagnosis requires histological confirmation,Guttate psoriasis often arises after staphylococcal infection,T cells play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis,Twin studies have identified no genetic basis for psoriasis,D,"Diagnosis of psoriasis is based on clinical observation of sharply demarcated, erythematous, scaling plaques, and rarely requires biopsy. Streptococcal infection is associated with precipitation and recurrence of guttate psoriasis. Ciclosporin is a major inhibitor of T cell activation and, given that T cells are central to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, is very effective treatment in psoriasis. Genetic studies have led most experts to believe that psoriasis is the result of multiple genetic factors interacting with environmental stimuli. Genetic factors also seem to contribute to the clinical manifestations of the disease, for example, age of onset and severity of disease."
others,389,Which of the following suggests a trochlea nerve (CNIV) palsy?,Ear pain,Horizontal diplopia,Torsional diplopia,Problem seeing things at a distance,Ptosis,C,"The trochlear nerve supplies the superior oblique muscle. Its action is to move the eye downwards and rotate it nasally. A palsy causes the eye to rotate and results in a torsional diplopia, meaning that images are seen at an angle. Patients often hold their head at an angle to compensate, and many have problems with their near vision. It can be congenital or acquired, mostly commonly after head injury."
others,390,Which of the following sutures is non-absorbable?,Dexon,Monocryl,PDS,Prolene,Vicryl,D,Monocryl is a synthetic absorbable monofilament vicryl (polyglactin). Polydioxanone synthetic (PDS) is a synthetic absorbable monofilament suture. Polyglactin 910 (vicryl/Dexon) is a synthetic absorbable braided suture. Polypropylene (Prolene) is a synthetic non-absorbable monofilament suture.
others,391,Which of the following would confirm a diagnosis of MS in a patient that has had their 3rd episode of optic neuritis?,Ptosis,Xanthochromia in the CSF,Visual Evoked Potentials (VEP) showing abnormalities in the normal eye,Abnormal nerve conduction studies,Normal MRI scan,C,"Multiple sclerosis is confirmed by the presence of lesions which are separated in space and time. Abnormal VEPs on the opposite optic nerve indicates a lesion on the opposite side of the brain. An MRI would show multiple, separate plaques and the CSF would have high levels of lymphocytes and oligoclonal bands. It is an upper motor neuron problem so peripheral nerves are unaffected."
others,392,Which of the listed common conditions can mimic the signs and symptoms of an acute stroke?,Cardiac arrest,Hypoglycaemia,Hypothyroidism,Pneumothorax,Stokes-Adams attacks,B,"Hypoglycaemia is common and mimics signs and symptoms of acute stroke; hence determination of blood glucose and treatment of hypoglycaemia is part of the initial assessment of a patient with symptoms or signs of acute stroke. Signs of cardiac arrest are:  unresponsiveness no breathing no pulse, and absence of other signs of circulation.  Stokes-Adams attacks present with sudden short lasting loss of consciousness resulting in falls. Hypothyroidism and pneumothorax are obviously false answers."
others,393,Which one of the following cancers has a five year survival greater than 60%?,Colon,Lung,Melanoma,Pancreatic,Stomach,C,Melanoma has a five year survival rate of 87-92%. The five year predicted survival of the other cancers listed is as follows:    Cancer Type Men Women Adults   Colon 59.1 57.3 58.2   Lung 8.4 11.6 9.5   Pancreas 3.5 3.1 3.3   Stomach 19.5 17.9 18.9    
others,394,Which one of the following conditions requires operative management?,Cellulitis,Dyshidrosis,Erysipelas,Fournier's gangrene,Lymphangitis,D,"Cellulitis, lymphangitis and erysipelas are non-localised infections and should be treated with immobilisation, elevation and antibiotics. Dyshidrosis is a type of dermatitis presenting as small fluid filled or pus filled bumps on the hands and feet. Fournier's gangrene is produced by mixed infections producing rapidly spreading subcutaneous and fascial necrosis. Treatment is by excision of the entire area of fascia and skin involved."
others,395,Which one of the following diseases is most likely to be associated with scleritis?,Ankylosing spondylitis,Crohn's disease,Rheumatoid arthritis,SLE,Ulcerative colitis,C,"Scleritis refers to inflammation that occurs throughout the entire thickness of the sclera, and it is usually more severe than episcleritis. It typically has a subacute onset, with pain being a dominant feature. Around 50% of patients with scleritis have an underlying disease, of which the majority are connective tissue disorders. Rheumatoid arthritis is the most common. It can also be seen in:  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) reactive arthritis polyarteritis nodosa ankylosing spondylitis gout Churg-Strauss syndrome syphilis, and Granulomatosis with polyangiitis."
others,396,Which one of the following gases can be measured by infrared analysers?,Carbon dioxide,Helium,Hydrogen,Nitrogen,Oxygen,A,"Gases with molecules that contain at least two dissimilar atoms absorb radiation in the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and all the halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents, can be measured using infrared absorption analysers. Oxygen, nitrogen, helium and the inert (or noble) gases, do not absorb infrared light, and cannot be measured using this technology. Oxygen is measured using the paramagnetic, galvanic or polarographic method."
others,397,Which one of the following increases the risk of an inadvertent laparoscopic diathermy injury?,A carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum,Adequate views of the operation field,Avoiding touching other instruments when the active electrode is in use,Good insulation of the active electrode only,Use of the lowest diathermy current possible,D,Carbon dioxide is an inert gas which prevents sparking when diathermy is used. Good views of the operation field are essential. Avoiding touching other instruments prevents inadvertent burns out of view of the operator. All laparoscopic instruments require good insulation to prevent inadvertent contact and sparking. Defective insulation on laparoscopic instruments can increase the risk of inadvertent diathermy injury which may be out of sight of the operating surgeon (who has not accidentally stood on the pedal during a procedure?). It is also essential that there is good insulation on the active cable from the diathermy machine to the diathermy instrument. The cable can be damaged by towel hooks used to secure it in place or the insulation may be damaged. Lower currents just cause smaller burns but do reduce the spread of current and sparking. Most surgeons have had an occasional burn to the hand due to cracked insulation on the active electrode (forceps) with monopolar diathermy.
others,398,Which one of the following is a recognised treatment option in poisoning?,Ethanol for isopropyl alcohol poisoning,Glucagon for cocaine poisoning,Methylene blue for cyanide poisoning,N-acetylcysteine in paraquat poisoning,Pralidoxime in sarin (nerve gas) poisoning,E,"Sarin is an organophosphorus. Pralidoxime reactivates acetyl cholinesterase enzyme. It should be used in the first few hours. Ethanol reduces the formation of toxic metabolites produced after ingestion of methanol and ethylene glycol, but not isopropyl alcohol. Glucagon is used in symptomatic beta blocker overdose. N-acetylcysteine is used in paracetamol overdose. Methylene blue is the antidote for serious methaemoglobinaemia.    "
others,399,Which one of the following is correct concerning pre-operative starvation?,Chewing bubble gum is contraindicated before a general anaesthetic (GA),Children can have a glass of milk up to two hours before a GA,Patients must not eat food for 10 hours before a GA,Patients scheduled for procedures under local anaesthesia with sedation can eat and drink normally,Water and clear fluids can be consumed up to 30 minutes before a GA,A,"The nil by mouth (NBM) policy may vary slightly between hospitals, but safe practice is as follows:  No solid food for six hours prior to a general anaesthetic or procedures involving sedation (milk is classed as solid food and so the same six hour rule applies) Water or clear fluids can be consumed up to two hours preoperatively (small volumes only) Chewing bubble gum or eating any type of confectionery should be avoided, as this promotes gastric acid secretion.  Patients having regional or local anaesthetic procedures (other than minor operations) should follow the same NBM policy as the general anaesthetic patients in case the type of anaesthetic has to change."
others,400,Which one of the following is true in the selection of suture needle shapes?,A 1/4 circle is most commonly used in rectal surgery,A 3/8 circle is most commonly used in urogenital surgery,A compound curve needle is most commonly used in the anterior segment of the eye,A J-shaped needle is most commonly used in microsurgery,A straight needle is most commonly used in eye surgery,C,The choice of needle shape is usually governed by the accessibility of the tissue to be sutured. In eye and microsurgery the needle is usually very small (9/0) with the surgeon operating with the aid of a telescope. The needle of choice is a circle. A straight needle allows the surgeon to choose the size of bite he takes and therefore a straight needle is used in skin and subcuticular suturing. Suturing at depth (low rectal surgery or closure of laparoscopic port site in an obese patient) requires the use of a J-shaped needle. The deeper and more confined the operating site the greater the curvature of the needle required. A 5/8 needle is used in the pelvis and oral cavity.
others,401,Which one of the following is true of radiological imaging in a septic patient?,A chest radiograph is of little use in suspected intra-abdominal sepsis,A CT should be performed as soon as the diagnosis of severe acute pancreatitis is made,An indium-111 labelled white cell scan has a good sensitivity for identification of occult abscesses,Diagnostic ERCP is the investigation of choice in suspected obstructive biliary disease,Ultrasound is the investigation of choice to diagnose appendicitis,C,"A chest radiograph can be performed easily and may show a pneumoperitoneum (perforation) or a right pleural effusion (sub-phrenic abscess). The diagnosis of appendicitis is clinical and reliance on ultrasound will result in missed appendicitis and its sequelae. CT has better sensitivity and specificity for appendicitis. The radiological changes are most evident in the pancreas three days following the onset of symptoms. White cell scans are also positive in sterile inflammation, hence specificity is lower. The investigation of choice is a magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatogram (MRCP) as diagnostic ERCP has an unacceptable pancreatitis rate. "
others,402,Which one of the following is true regarding breast cancer in pregnancy?,CA 19-9 is used as a tumour marker,Can be treated with mastectomy and axillary node sampling,Chemotherapy can be safely used in the first trimester,Has an incidence of 2%,Has better prognosis compared with non-pregnant women,B,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in pregnant and postpartum women, occurring in about 1 in 3,000 pregnant women. The average patient is between 32 to 38 years of age and with many women choosing to delay childbearing, it is likely that the incidence of breast cancer during pregnancy will increase. The overall survival of pregnant women with breast cancer may be worse than in non-pregnant women at all stages and may be due to the delay in diagnosis due to the enlargement of the breast during pregnancy. Breast cancer in pregnancy is usually treated with mastectomy/lumpectomy with axillary clearance. Chemotherapy, if required, can be given in the second and third trimester and appears to be safe. If chemotherapy is required in the first trimester, termination of pregnancy should be discussed. CA 15-3 or CEA are used as tumour markers. CA19-9 is used as a tumour marker for pancreatic Ca. "
others,403,Which one of the following is true regarding Peutz-Jegher's syndrome?,Is associated with a risk of malignant transformation,It is associated with adenomatous polyps of the small intestine,It is associated with the presence of pigmented lesions are seen in the axilla,It is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition,Often presents in childhood with B12 deficiency anaemia,A,Recent data suggest that Peutz-Jegher's syndrome is a premalignant condition with 50% of patients affected developing cancer by the age of 57. The small intestinal polyps are hamartomas and not adenomas. The circumoral pigmented lesions are a characteristic feature of this condition. Peutz-Jegher's syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition. As a result children with one affected (heterozygous) parent have a 50% chance of developing the condition. It can present as anaemia in childhood. The anaemia is a hypochromic microcytic anaemia resulting from iron deficiency.
others,404,Which one of the following signs suggests a significant injury in a patient involved in a high speed road traffic collision?,High riding prostate,Periumbilical discolouration (Cullen's sign),Plain abdominal x ray showing a 'gasless abdomen',Positive Murphy's sign,Tingling or hyperactive bowel sounds,A,"Tingling or hyperactive bowel sounds is a sign of intestinal (bowel) obstruction; in visceral injury, bowel sounds are usually absent. Murphy's sign is not indicative of injury to a viscus; it is a sign elicited in acute cholecystitis. High riding prostate is a sign of injury to the bladder neck and is seen with pelvic fractures. Periumbilical discolouration is a sign commonly seen in acute pancreatitis; discolouration of the flanks [Grey Turner's sign] occurs with visceral injury. Gasless abdomen is a classical feature of acute small bowel ischaemia. In abdominal injury causing perforation of a hollow viscus, there is free air in the abdominal cavity, commonly under the diaphragm."
others,405,Which one of the following statements concerning laryngeal mask airway is correct?,A size 2.5 laryngeal mask has a cuff inflation volume of 10 ml,A size 4 laryngeal mask has an internal diameter of 4 mm,Down folding of the epiglottis occurs in 90% of patients,Reinforced laryngeal masks have a higher flow resistance,When the laryngeal mask is correctly positioned the black line on the tube should face the lower lip,D,"The laryngeal mask airway (LMA) is a widely used device and provides an alternative to the face mask or tracheal tube during anaesthesia. Seven different sizes of LMA are available that are designed for use in infants to large adults. The recommended cuff inflation volumes on LMA sizes 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 5 and 6 are 4, 10, 14, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ml respectively. In order to reduce the flow resistance to a minimum LMAs have wide internal diameters (for example, the internal diameter of sizes 2, 3, 4, and 5 are 7, 10, 10 and 11.5 mm respectively). Reinforced LMAs are longer and have smaller internal diameters than standard LMAs causing an increase in flow resistance. At the junction of the tube and the cuff on the LMA, there are slits that prevent the epiglottis from obstructing the airway. However, 10% of patients still develop an obstructed airway due to down folding of the epiglottis. Rotation of the LMA can result in complete obstruction of the airway. A black line is present along the length of the tube and when an LMA is correctly orientated, the black line should face the upper lip (not lower lip)."
others,406,Which skin condition is pre-malignant?,Dermatitis herpetiformis,Keratoacanthoma,Molluscum contagiosum,Pyogenic granuloma,Solar keratosis (actinic keratosis),E,"Solar keratosis is the most common pre-malignant lesion usually seen in older light-complexioned individuals. The progression from actinic keratosis to invasive malignancy occurs by several routes, and the resulting cancer is a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in almost all cases. Dermatitis herpetiformis is seen in patients with coeliac disease. There are extremely itchy, burning blisters over the elbows, scalp, shoulders and ankles. They are not pre-malignant. Keratoacanthoma is not a pre-malignant lesion but often mimics SCC. Although the lesion might evolve and disappear without specific therapy (hence the name 'self-limiting' SCC), early conservative excision of sufficient depth to eliminate the entire lesion is recommended. Molluscum contagiosum are wart-like lesions commonly found on the hands of children or adolescents. They are caused by a virus and are not pre-malignant. Pyogenic granulomas are fruit-like cutaneous vascular lesions, which occur either spontaneously or secondary to some form of trauma. They grow rapidly, erupting through the skin and forming a stalk or pedicle. They may regresses spontaneously, but sometimes require cauterisation and/or surgical excision."
others,407,Which statement is true of benign breast disease?,Atypical lobular hyperplasia is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer,Cyclical mastalgia is an uncommon reason for referral to the breast clinic,Duct ectasia is less common in smokers,Fibroadenomas are derived from the breast connective tissue,Lactational breast abscesses are usually due to Streptococcus pyogenes,A,Cyclical mastalgia is the commonest reason for presentation and is usually evident from the history of pain related to the menstrual cycle. It is exacerbated by progestogens. Duct ectasia is more common in smokers. Fibroadenomas are derived from a whole breast lobule. They are considered an abnormality of normal development. Lactational breast abscesses are usually due to Staphylococcus aureus.
others,408,Which statement is true of sterilisation?,Ethylene oxide is a suitable alternative to heat sterilisation,Flash autoclaving at 147°C and 40 lb/square inch is the preferred method of sterilisation by steam,Hot air sterilisation is the preferred method to treat surgical instruments with fine cutting edges,Sterilisation by ethylene oxide is ineffective against spores,The requirement for effective sterilisation in a high speed pre-vacuum steriliser is 20 minutes at 121°C,C,"Hot-air ovens have the benefit of not causing corrosion in non-stainless metals and not damaging fine cutting edges in delicate instruments. Under optimal conditions of concentration, temperature and exposure time, ethylene oxide has a broad spectrum -cidal action against bacteria, spores and viruses. However, ethylene oxide is toxic, irritant, mutagenic and carcinogenic . Its use requires extreme caution. Flash autoclaving is no longer recommended or available for safety reasons; the preferred setting is 132°C (30 lb in-2) held for three minutes. This method is a convenient way to deal with dropped instruments. Pre-vacuum sterilisers require either 30 minutes at 121°C or 4 minutes at 132°C."
others,409,"Whilst closing a laparotomy incision, the scrub nurse asks which sutures you require. Which of the following is true of suture material?",Absorbable sutures can cause buttonhole hernias,Jenkins rule dictates the length of suture to be used in an amputation stump,Only fine non-absorbable sutures should be used in a vascular anastomosis,Persistent infection and sinus formation is more common with non-braided sutures,The choice of suture should be dictated by the surgeon's preference,C,The choice of suture is dictated by the expected rate of healing of the tissue being sutured. The process of capillarity (the characteristic that allows the passage of tissue fluid along the strands) is more common with braided sutures. Jenkins rule (the suture material should be four times the length of the wound and each bite should be 1 cm deep and 1 cm apart) applies to the mass closure technique of the rectus. Monofilament Prolene is the suture of choice in vascular anastomosis as there is a lower associated long term anastomotic (false) aneurysm formation than with other sutures. A buttonhole hernia results when an non-absorbable suture erodes defects through the muscle layer.
others,410,"Whilst closing a wound in theatre, the scrub nurse asks which needle and suture you require. Which of the following is correct in the selection of suture needle types?",A blunt round point is the needle of choice in tendon repairs,A blunt taperpoint is the needle of choice in ligament repairs,A reverse cutting needle should be used in a mass closure,A round bodied needle is used in a bowel anastomosis,A Tapercut^TM is the needle of choice to suture liver,D,"A Tapercut^TM combines the initial penetration of a cutting needle with the minimised trauma of the round-bodied needle. The cutting tip is limited to the point of the needle. This is the needle of choice for fascia, ligament or scar tissue. Blunt taperpoint is the needle of choice when needlestick injury is a major concern (high risk patients). On a reverse cutting needle the body is triangular in cross section with the apex on the outside of the needle curvature. This the needle of choice in skin, ligament and tendon. Round bodied needles are designed to separate tissue fibres rather than cut them. After the passage of the needle the tissue closes tightly round the suture material, therefore forming a leak proof suture line making them the needle of choice in bowel and vascular anstomosis. A blunt point needle has been designed for suturing extremely friable vascular tissue, for example, liver, spleen and kidney."
others,411,Why is it possible to transplant the cornea without tissue typing?,It does not stimulate an immune response,It is devoid of a blood supply,It is devoid of a nerve supply,It is devoid of connective tissue,It is non-proteinaceous,B,The reason that the cornea may be transplanted without immune typing is because it is without a blood supply and so immune rejection cannot be completed.
others,412,With which of the following are Pseudomonas infections associated?,Faeculent-like odour,Grape-like odour,Red exudates,Sloughy exudates,Urea-like odour,B,"Pseudomonas spp. is an ubiquitous facultative anaerobe. Proteus infections are associated with urea-like odours. Bacteroides, Fusobacteria, and Clostridia infections produce a faeculent odour."
others,413,You are asked to advise on analgesia for a 44-year-old woman with acute intermittent porphyria who has undergone wisdom teeth extraction. Which of the following drugs is safe for use in her treatment?,Cephalexin ,Cetirizine,Diclofenac,Erythromycin,Ibuprofen,E,"Many drugs may induce acute porphyric crises thus great care must be taken when prescribing for patients with acute porphyria. Drugs unsafe for use in acute porphyria include  Barbiturates Tricyclic antidepressants Monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOIs) Amphetamines Anabolic steroids Hormone replacement therapy Benzodiazepines Diuretics Captopril Cephalosporins Erythromycin Isoniazid Sulphonamides Sulphonylureas Theophylline Antihistamines Nifedipine Verapamil Amiodarone  Simvastatin.  Ibuprofen is safe for use in acute intermittent porphyria, but diclofenac should be avoided."
others,414,You are asked to conduct an audit into postoperative surgical site nfection. Which operation is likely to be associated with the highest rate of postoperative infection?,Abdominal hysterectomy,Below knee amputation,Cholecystectomy,Colonic resection,Knee replacement,D,"The most recent figures for surgical site infection rates can be found in Surgical site infections (SSI) surveillance: NHS Hospitals 2012 to 2013 from Public Health England. The number of general surgical procedures recorded in this data is low (c. 4000 large bowel operations). The submissions for orthopaedic (c. 37,000 hip and c. 37,000 knee replacements) and cardiac procedures are probably reliable as this data is mandatory. Colonic surgery had the highest infection rates of 10% (clean contaminated), 15.2% (contaminated/dirty) and 17.2% (emergency admissions). Cholecystectomy had a rate of 8.9% (clean/clean contaminated). Limb amputation is associated with an overall infection rate at 1.5% (clean/clean contaminated) and 5.6% (contaminated/dirty)."
others,415,"You are asked to see a 75-year-old man post-oversew of a duodenal ulcer. He is confused. His SpO2 is 97 on oxygen. Pulse 110 beats per min, blood pressure 100/50 mmHg, respiratory rate 32/min and his urine output is 10 ml in the last hour. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this man?",100% oxygen via face mask,Central line and arterial line,Normal saline 500 ml stat,Haloperidol 2.5 mg intravenously,Noradrenaline via central line,C,Postoperative confusion is common in the elderly. However this can be caused by a low perfusion state. His observations are indicative of underfilling/dehydration. (He could also have atelectais or have developed a chest infection. Post-operative problems are often multifactorial.) Of the options given a fluid bolus is appropriate. This is what you would expect your FY1 to do while waiting for the blood test results and before calling you. Some would argue that 100% oxygen comes before fluids but with an SpO2 of 97 it is unlikely that hypoxia is contributing to his problems. (nonetheless oxygen therapy would be recommended). The other options would come further down the line if initial interventions were unsuccessful and he deteriorated.
others,416,"You are attending a 70-year-old man recently treated for Parkinson's disease, to which treatment he has been showing good response. His son wants to know how likely he is to develop Parkinson's disease. There is no family history of Parkinson's disease. What is the correct factor in this case?",Inheritance pattern of this disease is not known,It all depends on the exposure to the environmental factors,Late onset disease is not usually familial,The disease is autosomal dominant,The disease is autosomal recessive,A,"Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder which selectively affects dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, cultimating in their destruction. After approximately 50% of the dopamine neurones, and 75-80% of striatal dopamine is lost patients start to exhibit the classical signs of bradykinesia, resting tremor and rigidity. Despite many years of research, the cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors still remains unclear. Early studies showed that protoxin n-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) causes parkinsonism in animals and humans. Other environmental toxins have also been linked, but there is no clear causation between exposure and disease. Up until 10 years ago, it was widely thought that Parkinson's disease was not a genetic disorder. However, since then inherited forms have been identified and there have been a number of genetic findings culminating in the cloning of several genes from loci which have been given the nomenclature PARK1 to PARK 12. α-synuclein is thought to be an important moleceule in the dopaminergic signalling pathways. In addition, single genes have been linked to heritable forms of Parkinson's disease, including SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, DJ1 and LRRK2. The inheritance pattern differs depending on the gene that is altered: LRRK2 and SNCA mutations are autosomal dominant; PARK2, PARK7 and PINK1 are autosomal recessive. Despite the identification of these genes, the majority of the cases remain idiopathic and therefore the inheritance pattern of this disease is not known. "
others,417,You have been asked to see a patient in recovery who has had a carotid endarterectomy. There is a large bulge at the site of the operation with blood seeping through. The patient has developed a stridor. The nurse is pressing on the neck and the surgeon is scrubbed in theatre with an emergency. What is the best course of action?,Call an anaesthetist urgently,Continue pressure until the surgeon is available,Open the wound and release the haematoma,Start intravenous fluids and call for blood,Try to intubate the patient,A,This patient is bleeding from his carotid endarterectomy site. The patient has started to exhibit stridor from laryngeal oedema secondary to the pressure of the haematoma. Evacuation of the haematoma may not reduce the laryngeal oedema and can worsen the stridor. There may also be considerable arterial bleeding. The most important first step is to intubate the patient and should only be done by a trained anaesthetist as it will be difficult. Once intubated the wound can be opened and the haematoma evacuated in theatre and any bleeding vessels cauterised.
others,418,You plan to treat the symptomatic varicose veins of a 28-year-old woman by means of endovenous laser ablation. The procedure must be performed in a laser control area. Which of the following is correct regarding a laser control area?,Adequate ventilation must be provided,All surfaces must be coated in matt black paint,Eye protection is optional,Only a laser safety officer (LSO) is permitted to use the laser,Only the person discharging the laser is permitted to be present,A,"An LSO is appointed from the staff of each department using the laser and has custody of the laser key. All persons using a laser should be suitably trained and be aware of all safety precautions. There should be a control of personnel allowed to enter the area and the entrance should be marked with appropriate illuminated warning signs. Reflective surfaces should be avoided. However, matt black surfaces are not necessary. Eye protection must be appropriate to the type of laser being used. The ventilation should include an extraction system to vent the fumes produced."

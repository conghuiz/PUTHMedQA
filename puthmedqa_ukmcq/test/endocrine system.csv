endocrine system,1,What is the most common cause of endogenous Cushing's syndrome?,Small cell carcinoma of the lung,Pituitary adenoma,Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia type 1,Phaeochromocytoma,Adrenal adenoma,B,The most common cause of Cushing's syndrome is steroid treatment. The most common endogenous cause is a Pituitary adenoma and this is referred to as Cushing's disease.Please note we get a lot of feedback saying pituitary adenoma causes Cushing disease and not Cushing's syndrome. A syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms associated with a given condition. Cushing's syndrome relates to the signs and symptoms of overproduction of corticosteroid hormones. Cushing's disease relates to a pituitary tumour causing overproduction of corticosteroid hormones. Cushing's disease is therefore a cause of Cushing's syndrome. Cushing's Cushing's syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms due to raised levels of cortisol.Cushing's disease is a cause of Cushing's syndrome where increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary stimulates cortisol production. This is typically the result of a pituitary adenoma.
endocrine system,2,"A 22-year-old student nurse is admitted after a third episode of collapse whilst on attachment in the Emergency Department of the hospital. She has no past medical history of note and her only medication is the progesterone only pill. On further questioning she says she feels light-headed and hungry to the pit of her stomach before these collapses occur and tells you that none of these attacks have occurred outside the hospital. On examination her BP is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 78 and general physical examination is entirely normal. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 132 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 4.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 172 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 µmol/L (79-118)   Glucose (in recovery period) 2.8 mmol/L (greater than3.0)    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Admit for a 72 hour fast,Arrange an exercise provocation test,Arrange an ultrasound abdomen,Give her glucagon to carry around in case an attack occurs,"Glucose, insulin, and C peptide assay at the time of an attack",E,"Given all of this woman's attacks occur within the hospital, and the fact that she potentially has access to insulin, it raises the possibility of exogenous administration of insulin by the patient herself. As such the best way to differentiate between insulinoma and exogenous insulin administration is glucose, insulin, and C peptide, as with self administration of insulin, C peptide is low, but in contrast with insulinoma it would be elevated. The idea of a urine assay for sulphonylureas should also be gently introduced to her. It is not appropriate to give her glucagon to carry around until the cause of her hypoglycaemia is properly established. If an insulinoma is suspected, then exercise provocation is usually avoided because of the risk of serious hypoglycaemia, the majority of patients being diagnosed after a 72 hour fast. An ultrasound of the abdomen would only be considered if an insulinoma was suspected."

endocrine system,4,"A 45-year-old male presents concerned about his risk of developing diabetes. His family history reveals that his mother and maternal uncle both have diabetes. He has central obesity with a waist measurement of 110 cm. On examination, his blood pressure is 130/82 mmHg, his BMI is 30.2 kg/m^2. His investigations reveal:    Fasting cholesterol 5.2 mmol/L (less than5.2)   200 mg/dL (less than200)   Triglycerides 1.4 mmol/L (0.45-1.69)   124 mg/dL (40-150)   HDL cholesterol 1.1 mmol/L (greater than1.55)   42 mg/dL (greater than60)   Fasting glucose 6.2 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   111 mg/dL (54-108)    In addition to his waist measurement which one of this man's observations is a criterion for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome?",Blood pressure of 130/82 mmHg,BMI of 30.2 kg/m^2,Fasting plasma glucose of 6.2 mmol/L (110 mg/dL),HDL concentration of 1.1 mmol/L (42 mg/dL),Triglyceride concentration of 1.4 mmol/L (124 mg/dL),C,"The metabolic syndrome is becoming hugely important as a cluster of features associated with increased cardiovascular and diabetes risk. The condition is defined by various criteria the latest of which is the global definition for the IDF as central obesity (≥94 cm for men, ≥80 cm for women) plus any two of the following:  Hypertriglyceridaemia greater than1.7 mmol/L Low HDL concentration less than1.03 mmol/L male, less than1.29 mmol/L female BP ≥ 130/85 mmHg, or on treatment for hypertension Fasting glucose ≥5.6 mmol/L, or known to have type 2 diabetes.  Thus, in our patients case the elevated fasting glucose of 6.2 mmol/L fulfils this diagnostic criterion. The BMI is not a function of the diagnostic criterion as the waist circumference appears to be a far more powerful predictor of risk. "
endocrine system,5,A 50-year-old woman is seen in the clinic because of deranged liver function tests (LFTs). She drinks at most 4 units of alcohol weekly. There is no past medical history of note. Her Dentist prescribed amoxicillin a month ago for an oral infection. On examination she is obese with a BMI of 45 kg/m^2 and her LFTs show:    ALT 140 U/L (5-40)   AST 150 U/L (10-40)   Alkaline phosphatase 250 U/L (45-105)    Which of the following is the most likely cause of this derangement?,Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,Drug induced,Hyperparathyroidism,Hypertension,Hypothyroidism,A,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most likely cause of liver enzyme abnormalities in this patient. It is is caused by fatty accumulation in the liver leading to inflammation. NAFLD is part of the metabolic syndrome and is common in obese patients and often associated with hypertension and dyslipidaemia in addition to insulin resistance. Other causes of hepatitis need to be excluded before making this diagnosis. Patients who are obese and diabetic are advised to lose weight and control their diabetes. Usually, a low fat, low calorie diet is recommended alongside treatment to lower HbA1c. Patients with NAFLD should avoid alcohol or other substances that could be harmful to the liver. Deranged liver enzymes are not listed as side effects for amoxicillin in the British National Formulary. "
endocrine system,6,"A 52-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes comes to the clinic for review. She is currently managed with metformin 1 g BD with respect to glucose control, and her only other medication at the moment is lisinopril 20 mg daily and simvastatin 40 mg. On examination her BP is 138/82 mmHg, her pulse is 82 and regular. Her BMI is 27 kg/m^2. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (115-165)   White cells 7.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet 184 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 119 µmol/L (79-118)   HDL cholesterol 0.9 mmol/L (1.0-2.3)   LDL cholesterol 3.9 mmol/L (less than4.0)   Triglycerides 3.1 mmol/L (0.5-1.7)   HbA1c 89 mmol/mol (less than36)   9.3% (less than5.5)    Which of the following is the most appropriate initial step to impact on her triglycerides?",Additional blood glucose lowering therapy,Exercise programme,Fibrate therapy,High dose statin therapy,Omega 3 fatty acid supplementation,A,"The answer is additional blood glucose lowering therapy. Under-treatment with respect to blood glucose lowering therapy leads to hypertriglyceridaemia and raised HbA1c. As such the first priority in this patient is to improve her glucose control with a second oral agent. JBS2 guidelines suggest that all patients with type 2 diabetes should be prescribed a statin, even if their cholesterol is within the target range, although statin therapy impacts most on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. In patients with type 2 diabetes who have hypertriglyceridaemia despite optimal glucose control and statin therapy, treatments targeted for triglyceride reduction, such as niacin, fibrates, or omega-3 fatty supplementation should be considered."
endocrine system,7,A 52-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus presented with hepatomegaly. Investigations revealed:    Albumin 30 g/L (37-49)   Total bilirubin 22 µmol/L (1-22)   Alkaline phosphatase 134 U/L (60-110)   ALT 90 U/L (5-35)   Gamma-glutamyl transferase 125 U/L (less than50)   Ferritin 1450 µg/L (15-300)    Which of the following features would be most suggestive of a diagnosis of haemochromatosis?,Chondrocalcinosis,Gynaecomastia,Migratory polyarthritis,Myxoedema,Rash,A,"This man with diabetes has evidence of liver disease with grossly elevated ferritin, suggesting a diagnosis of haemochromatosis. Haemachromatosis is caused by dysregulated iron homeostatis due to inappropriate increased iron absorption in the duodenum and proximal small intestine. It is an autosomal recessive hereditary condition which is associated with homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in North Europeans. Increased absorption of iron results in its deposition in the organs, notably the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, skin, and pituitary. This causes cirrhosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, skin hyperpigmentation, and gonadal failure. Males and females are affected equally, but females are often 'protected' from the clinical features by menstrual blood loss. Arthropathy is relatively common. It is chronic and progressive and mildly inflammatory. There is a predilection for the MCP joints and it is often accompanied by chondrocalcinosis. Iron load is probably a major determinant but it does not usually respond to venesection. Early diagnosis and treatment is critical in haemochromatosis as survival and morbidity are improved if phlebotomy is initiated prior to the development of cirrhosis. Transferrin saturation is suggested as the initial screening test: a level of more than 45% warrants further investigation (less than 45% usually excludes the diagnosis). Genetic screening is then performed. If the usual C282Y HFE mutation is found this makes the diagnosis. Ferritin is measured to help guide further investigation and treatment: if more than 1000 a liver biopsy should be performed and treatment initiated. If the ferritin is within normal range and the liver function tests are normal patients can be followed closely. If the C282Y HFE mutation is not present other genotypes should be looked for and if present a liver biopsy is indicated. The goal of therapy is to remove excess body iron stores; it is commonly done via phlebotomy. Initially, this is weekly or twice weekly (if tolerated) venesections of 500 cm^3 until the serum ferritin is less than 50 ng/mL. Transferritin saturation should also be reduced to less than 50% if possible. After these goals are reached maintenance therapy is typically required three to four times per year. When iron overload and anaemia are present concomitantly chelation with desferoxamine may be required. Patients should be told to avoid vitamin C supplementation as this can enhance iron toxicity. End stage liver disease, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma (which is increased up to 200-fold) may necessitate liver transplantation. This is associated with poorer outcome compared with other indications because of increased incidence of infection and cardiac complications. Haemochromatosis is classically associated with a non-migratory, rather than migratory, polyarthritis. This particularly affects the hands: in over 50% of patients there is involvement of the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints, but the proximal interphalangeal joints, knees, feet, wrists, back and neck are also commonly involved. Skin pigmentation rather than a rash is more typical. Myxoedema is not a feature of haemochromatosis. Gynaecomastia is a feature of liver disease/cirrhosis per se and not just haemochromatosis. Haemochromatosis can cause hypogonadism which can also be associated with gynaecomastia but costochondrosis is a more reliable sign. "
endocrine system,8,Which of the following is true of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)?,Secretion is inhibited by mineralocorticoids,Production is governed by the pituitary,Is not present in the placenta,Is increased in the maternal plasma in pregnancy,Production is maximal about midnight,D,"The production of ACTH is governed through the secretion of corticotropin‐releasing hormone from the hypothalamic nuclei.It governs cortisol secretion where cortisol is secreted maximally in the morning and concentrations are at a nadir at midnight.ACTH can be expressed in numerous tissues besides the pituitary and including the placenta. ACTH concentrations rise in stress, disease and in pregnancy.Through negative feedback, glucocorticoids (not mineralocorticoids ‐ aldosterone) switch off ACTH production."
endocrine system,9,A 16-year-old girl is noted to have persistent polyuria in excess of 4 litres per day whilst recovering from a head injury she sustained in a road traffic accident. Investigations reveal:    Potassium 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Calcium 2.4 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Glucose 5.6 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)    Which one of the following is the most effective method of confirming the diagnosis?,Autoantibodies to vasopressin neurones,MRI of the hypothalamus and pituitary,Therapeutic trial of low dose DDAVP,Vasopressin concentration,Water deprivation test,E,The history and confirmed polyuria are suspicious of diabetes insipidus (DI) which is not uncommon after head injury. This can be confirmed with a water deprivation test where failure of urine concentration would be expected. An MRI of the pituitary and hypothalamus may show no abnormality but would be undertaken after the diagnosis of DI is confirmed. Similarly anterior hormone assessment would also be undertaken after the diagnosis is confirmed. A therapeutic trial of DDAVP is only appropriate if the diagnosis of DI is confirmed as primary polydipsia can also be a feature of trauma and in these circumstances DDAVP may precipitate hyponatraemia. Autoantibodies to antidiuretic hormone (ADH) neurones are irrelevant.

endocrine system,11,"A 57-year-old woman presents with a temperature of 39.6°C, tachycardia and jaundice. Her husband tells you that she has been increasingly confused and agitated over the past few days. Her only past history of note is an inguinal hernia repair in the previous week. On examination her BP is 105/70 mmHg, her pulse is 130, atrial fibrillation, she has jaundiced sclerae. She is agitated and poorly compliant with the examination. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 109 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 10.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 190 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 120 µmol/L (79-118)   Alanine aminotransferase 78 U/L (5-40)   Bilirubin 72 µmol/L (less than17)   TSH less than0.05 IU/L (0.5-4.5)    Which of the following treatments should be used first?",Aspirin,Carbimazole,Diclofenac,Potassium iodide,Prednisolone,B,"This patient has a thyrotoxic crisis and requires rapid control of her symptoms. This is an uncommon medical emergency, caused by an exacerbation of hyperthyroidism often due to intercurrent illness, trauma, or emergency surgery. It most often occurs in the setting of Graves' disease, but can be seen with toxic adenoma or multinodular toxic goitre. Thyrotoxic storm presents as described above, with sudden onset of severe hyperthyroidism with hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, nausea, jaundice, vomiting, diarrhoea, confusion, agitation, psychosis, seizures, or coma. Investigations should look for underlying precipitants. Thyroid function should also be checked, which classically shows elevated T3 and T4, with suppressed TSH levels. There can also be renal impairment, elevated creatine kinase, electrolyte imbalance (due to dehydration), anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucocytosis, liver derangement (raised transaminases, lactate dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin), hypercalcaemia, and hyperglycaemia. Treatment should initially be of any precipitating cause. Resuscitation is then often required with oxygen, intravenous saline, and a nasogastric tube if vomiting is dominant. Immediate goals are to decrease thyroid hormone synthesis (antithyroid drugs), prevent thyroid hormone release (iodine), decrease peripheral action of circulating hormone by blocking T4 to T3 conversion (high-dose PTU, propranolol, corticosteroid) or blocking enterohepatic circulation (cholestyramine), and to treat the precipitating condition. Anti-thyroid treatment is initially with oral carbimazole or propylthiouracil. This should be administered immediately to prevent the formation of further thyroid hormone by inhibiting the iodination of tyrosine residues by TPO enzymes. PTU was traditionally preferred because it has a more rapid onset of action, and has the additional benefit of inhibiting peripheral deiodinase enzyme-mediated conversion of T4 into T3. However, there is now concern regarding the liver toxicity potential of PTU and therefore unless there are compelling reasons to use PTU (e.g. pregnancy) then carbimazole is used and T4 to T3 inhibition is achieved with beta blockers and corticosteroids. Iodine is then given after at least one hour, to block the release of preformed thyroid hormone. This should not be given prior to carbimazole as this can result in tyrosine residue iodination and enrichment of thyroid hormone stores. Typical UK practice is to prescribe 1 ml of Lugol's solution orally every six hours. Betablockers can then be given immediately following carbimazole, to block adrenergic consequences of thyroid hormone release. Propranolol is traditionally used as it can be given intravenously and is relatively short acting. Cardioselective betablockers, such as metoprolol or atenolol, can be used if there is contraindication to propranolol (asthma, COPD). Diltiazem is an alternative option if there is contraindication to all betablockers. Corticosteroids inhibit peripheral conversion of T4 into T3, and can improve outcomes in thyroid storm. Hydrocortisone is usually used, but dexamethasone is an alternative. Paracetamol should be used for pyrexia, not aspirin as this can increase T4. Further management depends on the progress of the patient, but in severe cases exchange transfusion or haemodialysis may be required. Untreated, such cases are usually fatal. Even with early diagnosis and treatment, the mortality is 20-50%. "
endocrine system,12,33. A 35-year-old man is being investigated for infertility. Which of the following tests would prove that he has complete azoospermia?,Prolactin,Oestrogen level,Testosterone,Gonadotrophine,Follicle stimulating hormone,C,Low testosterone may lead to azoospermia. But surprisingly testosterone replacement can improve libido but not help azoospermia as it causes follicle stimulating hormone suppression. So testosterone rise should be done by natural means to improve fertility!
endocrine system,13,Which of the following is the main role of the gut hormone secretin?,Promotes gastric acid formation,Promotes secretion of bicarbonate by the pancreas,Reduces bile flow,Stimulates lipolysis and glycolysis,Vasodilatation and relaxation of smooth muscle in gut,B,"Secretin promotes bicarbonate secretion, reduces gastric acid formation and increases bile flow. Another gut hormone, VIP, stimulates lipolysis, glycolysis and relaxation of the smooth muscle of the gut. The structure, stimulus for secretion, and actions of these hormones are outlined below. Secretin is secreted by the S cells of the granular mucosa which are predominantly located in the duodenum. Unlike gastrin, which is highly fragmented, there are no active fragmentary molecules of secretin; the whole molecule is required for biological activity. Stimulation for secretion:  acid in the duodenum (pHless than4.5), and secretion is inhibited by somatostatin.  There are very low concentrations of secretin found in the blood (too low to measure accurately). The half life of secretin is 4 min. The action of secretin is potentiated by CCK. These actions include:  stimulates bicarbonate secretion from pancreas stimulates bicarbonate and water secretion by the liver increases bile flow and gallbladder contractility reduces gastric and duodenal motility, and inhibits normal gastrin secretion and thus reduces gastric acid formation.  Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is a polypeptide hormone with structural similarities to GIP, secretin, and glucagon. VIP is predominantly found in the nervous system and gut and is considered a neurotransmitter. It has a plasma half life of 1 min and is largely inactivated after a single pass through the liver. Stimulation for secretion:  vagal stimulation relationship to gut stimuli and eating is unclear.  Actions:  vasodilatation and relaxation of smooth muscle in circulatory and GI systems promotes water and electrolytes secretion from the gut promotes secretion of pancreatic hormones, and stimulates lipolysis, glycolysis and inhibits gastric acid secretion.

endocrine system,14,A 62-year-old woman develops a pancreatic fistula following a Whipple resection for adenocarcinoma. What is her uncorrected acid base status likely to be?,Metabolic acidosis,Metabolic alkalosis,Normal,Respiratory acidosis,Respiratory alkalosis,A,In the presence of an untreated pancreatic fistula there will be a large loss of bicarbonate leading to a fall in pH. Respiratory compensation will include blowing off the carbon dioxide to reduce the acidosis and the kidneys will try to secrete hydrogen and hold onto bicarbonate. The use of somatostatin analogues slows down the pancreatic losses and so reduces the loss of bicarbonate.
endocrine system,15,"A 50-year-old man with insulin dependent diabetes presents with a two week history of an acutely painful, erythematosus, swollen left mid-foot for the last two weeks. He does not drink alcohol, and has had no recent injuries to the foot. On examination, the mid-foot is warm. Pedal pulses are intact. There is sensory loss in a glove and stocking distribution bilaterally. Recent blood tests show a normal FBC, CRP, urea, and electrolytes and creatinine. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cellulitis,Charcot joint,Deep venous thrombosis,Fragility fracture,Gout,B,"In patients with longstanding diabetes and peripheral neuropathy, a red hot swollen foot should raise suspicion of Charcot neuroarthropathy. Charcot neuropathy presents as a warm, swollen, erythematous foot and ankle, and infection is important to exclude. The majority of patients are in their 50-60s, and they often present in the latter stages of the disease. It can occur in association with a variety of conditions, including leprosy, poliomyelitis, and rheumatoid arthritis, although today the most common cause is diabetes mellitus. The pathophysiology of Charcot neuroarthropathy is not completely understood, but is thought to start with peripheral neuropathy. The lack of pain sensation may mean that patients subject the foot joints (commonly the midfoot) to stress injuries that lead to the Charcot process. It is important to note however that about half of patients present with pain. Four stages of Charcot neuropathy are recognised:  Stage 0 (inflammation) - characterised by erythema and oedema, but no structural changes Stage 1 (development) - bone resorption, fragmentation and joint dislocation. Swelling, warmth and erythema persist but there are also radiographic changes such as debris formation at the articular margins, osseous fragmentation, and joint disruption Stage 2 (coalescence) - bony consolidation, osteosclerosis, and fusion are all seen on plain radiographs Stage 3 (reconstruction) - osteogenesis, decreased osteosclerosis, progressive fusion. Healing and new bone formation occur, and the deformity becomes permanent.  Radiographs are an important part of investigating a patient with possible Charcot arthropathy. All radiographs should be taken in the weight-bearing position. MRI can demonstrate changes in the earlier stages of the condition, and is therefore important in allowing treatment to be instigated earlier. In stages 0 and 1, the treatment is immediate immobilisation and avoidance of weight bearing. A total-contact cast is worn until the redness, swelling and heat subside (generally 8-12 weeks, changed every 1-2 weeks to minimise skin damage). After this, the patient should use a removable brace for a total of four to six months. Bisphosphonates can be used, but evidence of clinical benefit is lacking. Surgery is reserved for severe deformities that are susceptible to ulceration, and where braces and orthotic devices are difficult to use. A normal FBC and CRP in this case make cellulitis unlikely. There is no swelling of the calf to suggest a deep vein thrombosis. Fragility fractures are those which are caused by a force equivalent to a fall from the height of a chair or less. They are typically seen on a background of osteoporosis and there is usually a history of trauma. Gout classically causes an acute monoarthritis and the presentation is typically more acute than described here. "

This has led to optic chiasm compression and loss of peripheral visual fields. For large invasive tumours gamma knife surgery or traditional adenomectomy are treatments of choice. Monitoring of ACTH regularly, and follow up MRI pituitary at three to six months post adrenalectomy are recommended to drive early intervention. Carbimazole is incorrect as this patient actually has pituitary dependent hypothyroidism as a result of his tumour. Increased hydrocortisone treatment will also not suppress the pituitary adenoma. Octreotide has shown some success in clinical trials but is inferior to surgical intervention, and thyroxine replacement, whilst correcting hypothyroidism will not resolve the underlying adenoma."

Which of the following features, according to the consensus, is true regarding sulphonylurea therapy?",Delayed onset of glucose lowering effect,Increased cardiovascular risk,Low risk of hypoglycaemia,Syngergistic effects when used with DPPIV inhibitors,Weight gain,E,"The question of increased cardiovascular risk for sulphonylureas (SUs) was raised after the university group diabetes programme (UGDP) study conducted during the 1970s. The consensus authors state, however, that the question has since been answered by the UK prospective diabetes study (UKPDS) and ADVANCE studies, where no cardiovascular risk signal was seen for SUs. Whilst SUs are well known to have a rapid onset of glucose lowering effect, their side-effects of hypoglycaemia and weight gain are well known. Any synergistic effect with DDP-IV inhibitors is widely debated."
endocrine system,24,Which of the following is true in diseases of the thyroid?,Anaesthetic agents and opiates can precipitate myxoedema coma,Hashimoto's disease is a cause of primary hypoparathyroidism,Pericardial effusions are a feature of hyperthyroidism,Radioactive iodine is associated with angina pectoris,Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are reduced in primary hypothyroidism,A,"Hypothyroidism can be primary or secondary to hypothalamic or pituitary disorders. The causes of primary hypothyroidism can be classified as follows:  impaired synthesis or release of thyroid hormones resistance to thyroid hormones destruction of the endocrine gland (surgery, radioactive iodine) autoimmune disease.  Hashimoto's disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes primary hypothyroidism (not hypoparathyroidism). The TSH level is elevated in all cases of primary hypothyroidism (not reduced) and can be normal or low in secondary hypothyroidism. The clinical features of hypothyroidism usually have an insidious onset, with females being more commonly affected than males. The cardiovascular features include  pericardial effusions bradycardia electrocardiograph abnormalities (inversion or flattening of the T waves and low voltage complexes).  Myxoedema coma may be precipitated by anaesthetic agents, opiates, cold and infection, and may be the presenting feature of hypothyroidism. Profound bradycardia, bradypnoea and hypothermia are common in hypothyroidism, and they require urgent treatment with thyroxine. Thyroxine can cause angina pectoris in patients with ischaemic heart disease or heart failure."

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial test as a pointer to the diagnosis?",Abdominal CT,Abdominal ultrasound,ERCP,Faecal elastase,Secretin stimulation test,D,"Faecal elastase is non-invasive and can be performed on a single stool sample. Low levels of faecal elastase are indicative of pancreatic exocrine deficiency and predictive of the response to supplementation. Abdominal ultrasound, CT, and ERCP may all indicate structural changes consistent with chronic pancreatitis, but do not provide the link to function and thus the cause of the diarrhoea. As such faecal elastase is the preferred answer. The secretin stimulation test is also a test of exocrine function but is invasive and therefore not a preferred investigation."
endocrine system,26,Which of the following is correct according to the current criteria for diagnosing diabetes in an asymptomatic patient?,75 g oral glucose test (OGT) is mandatory for diagnosing diabetes,A fasting venous plasma concentration of less than6.9 can be ignored,A single fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of greater than7 mmol/L can be used to diagnose diabetes,Impaired glucose tolerance is signified by a venous glucose concentration of less than7 mmol and greater than11.1 mmol,Two separate fasting venous plasma glucose concentration of 7 mmol/L or above are diagnostic of diabetes,E,"Questions about diagnosing diabetes are common in the AKT exam and often crop up on examiners' feedback reports. In an asymptomatic individual, a single sample alone is not sufficient for diagnosis. Diabetes can be diagnosed if separate fasting samples show 7 mmol/L or above. 75 g. OGT is still the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes, although fasting glucose can be used, provided adequate fast is ensured. Fasting glucose of above 6.1 but below 6.9 is classed as impaired fasting glycaemia, which is a new category of glycaemia. Impaired glucose tolerance is defined as glucose levels of 7.8-11.1 mmol/L."

endocrine system,29,"You are investigating a range of new agents for the treatment of inflammatory disorders, and are hoping to achieve steroid-like anti-inflammatory efficacy, without some of the known adverse effects. Which of the following is the most important effect of corticosteroid therapy leading to increased risk of bone fracture?",Increased bone mineralisation,Increased osteoblast activity,Increased osteoblast apoptosis,Increased osteoclast activity,Increased osteoclast apoptosis,C,"Corticosteroids are recognised to inhibit osteoblast activity and increase osteoblast apoptosis. This is thought to be a more important component in bone loss with respect to steroid induced osteoporosis versus any effect on osteoclasts. Corticosteroids do not increase bone mineralisation, if anything they impact negatively on bone mineralisation. They reduce osteoblast activity rather than increasing it. Whilst corticosteroids do increase osteoclast activity, it is thought to be their effect on osteoblast activity which has a greater impact on bone mineral density."
endocrine system,30,"In the treatment of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), which of the following statements is correct?",Efficacy of treatment is best monitored by 17-OH progesterone and androstenedione levels ,Hydrocortisone may be administered once daily,"Hypotension, hyperkalaemia, and hyperreninaemia suggest that the dose of mineralocorticoid should be reduced",Preferred treatment in children is prednisone,Renin activity levels are of no clinical use in treatment monitoring ,A,"The treatment of CAH is the lowest dose of glucocorticoid that suppresses (not totally) adrenal androgens, whilst maintaining normal growth, and weight gain. Renin activity levels can be used to monitor the adequacy of mineralocorticoid and sodium replacement. Hydrocortisone has a relatively short half-life and must therefore be administered twice daily. The preferred mode of glucocorticoid replacement in children is hydrocortisone as it minimises growth suppression. Over treatment with mineralocorticoids leads to hypertension, suppressed plasma rennin activity and possibly growth retardation."

She has no significant past medical history; specifically no change in weight or heat or cold intolerance, and only medication of note is the oral contraceptive pill. On examination her BP is 128/78 mmHg, her pulse is 64 and regular. She has a small thyroid nodule of around 8 mm in diameter on the left hand side of her neck. Her GP has checked a TSH which is in the normal range at 3.1. Which of the following investigations is most likely to lead to the diagnosis?",Anti-thyroid antibodies,Fine needle aspiration cytology,Free T4,Thyroid isotope scan,Thyroid ultrasound scan,B,"The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the normal range and the lack of symptoms of thyroid disease indicate that this patient is euthyroid. Sinister symptoms suggesting underlying malignancy include rapid enlargement of the nodule and development of a hoarse voice or dysphagia. A family history of thyroid cancer or a history of previous radiation treatment may further increase suspicion of underlying malignancy. Fine needle aspiration cytology case series indicate that satisfactory or diagnostic samples are obtained in over 85% of cases. Whilst ultrasound and isotope scanning may provide further information as to the nature of the nodule, they do not, of course, yield a tissue diagnosis."

She is unable to dorsiflex her left hand, and an orthopaedic registrar diagnoses a ruptured extensor tendon. She is receiving treatment for an infected diabetic foot ulcer. Which of the following therapies may be implicated in this injury?",Aripiprazole,Exenatide,Fusidic acid,Levofloxacin,Naproxen,D,"The quinolones have recently been associated with tendon rupture. Rupture has been reported in the achilles, shoulder and hand. This may occur due to disruption of the extracellular matrix and depletion of collagen which is observed in animal models. Aripiprazole is a second generation antipsychotic, and exenatide is a glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue used in the management of type 2 diabetes. Neither of these products has been associated with tendon rupture."

endocrine system,36,A 43-year-old male is diagnosed with diabetic nephropathy. If this patient had type 1 diabetes his chances of progressing to end stage renal disease (ESRD) would be approximately 50%. What percentage of type 2 diabetics with diabetic nephropathy would be expected to progress to ESRD?,15%,30%,45%,50%,55%,A,"The majority of patients with diabetic nephropathy have type 2 diabetes, however this is due to higher prevalence of type 2, rather than higher incidence of nephropathy (as incidence is in fact higher in type 1 DM). There are a number of stages in the development of nephropathy with glomerular hyperfiltration being an early feature. Nephropathy itself is signalled by the excretion of trace amounts of protein in the urine microalbuminuria. The progression of the disease may be attenuated by stringent blood pressure control (with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor [ACEi]) and strict glycaemic control."
endocrine system,37,Oral therapy with which of the following may cause galactorrhoea?,Bromocriptine,Cabergoline,Cimetidine,Domperidone,Spironolactone,D,Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist producing large rises in prolactin concentrations. Spironolactone has no effect on prolactin and cimetidine produces hyperprolactinaemia only when given intravenously (IV). Both bromocriptine and cabergoline are dopamine agonists and reduce prolactin. 
endocrine system,38,Which of the following symptoms is the most characteristic of hypocalcaemia?,Abdominal pain due to peptic ulceration,Polyuria and polydipsia,Renal calculi,Tetany,Weakness due to hypokalaemia,D,"Hypocalcaemia characteristically causes:  increased neuromuscular excitability, manifesting as tetany carpopedal spasm (Trousseau's sign) seizures hyperreflexia paraesthesia, and hypotension.  Weakness can also occur but is not generally associated with hypokalaemia. Chronic hypocalcaemia, even when mild, predisposes to cataract formation. The other symptoms above are more typically associated with hypercalcaemia:  peptic ulceration; calcium stimulates gastrin release and promotes increased secretion of gastric acid polyuria and polydipsia are typical, due to a type of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus - modification of the renal response to antidiuretic hormone causing dehydration renal calculi occur with chronic hypercalcaemia, and hypokalaemia can be due to hypercalcaemia as calcium inhibits reabsorption of potassium, promoting its loss in the urine."

Addison's & Adrenal Insufficiency Addison's BasicsAddison's disease or chronic adrenal insufficiency is a rare endocrine disorder where the adrenals produce insufficient steroid hormones. The term Addison's refers to primary adrenal insufficiency i.e. the adrenals themselves are the source of low steroid hormone production. There are several causes of this autoimmune adrenalitis being the most common.Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency refer to insufficient adrenal hormone production due to a cause external to the kidney i.e:Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient ACTH production by the pituitary Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient CRH production by the hypothalamusSigns & SymptomsHypotension Hyperpigmentation (this is due to increased ATCH production) Myalgia Arthralgia Weight loss Anxiety/personality change Coma in Addisons crisisBiochemical featuresHypercalcemia Hypoglycemia Hyponatremia Hyperkalemia Eosinophilia and lymphocytosis Metabolic acidosis

Whilst you are examining him, a nurse checks his finger prick glucose which is measured at 36.2 mmol/l. Which of the following investigations would be most suggestive of a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis?",Amylase 400 U/L,Bicarbonate 24 mmol/L,Lactate 1.6 mmol/L,Right lower lobe consolidation on chest x ray,Urinary tract infection on urine screen,A,"A raised amylase in the absence of frank pancreatitis is common in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), indeed many patients complain of a degree of abdominal pain at the time of presentation. No specific management is required and amylase falls with rehydration and control of blood glucose. Bicarbonate of 24 and lactate of 1.6 would both count against a diagnosis of ketoacidosis and favour an alternative such as hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). Infection can precipitate presentation with HHS or DKA, therefore, possible urine infection or pneumonia would not be useful differentiators here."
endocrine system,42,A 53-year-old male is suspected of having acromegaly. Which of the following is the best investigation to confirm the diagnosis?,9 am growth hormone (GH) concentrations,An insulin tolerance test with growth hormone concentrations ,Glucose tolerance test with growth hormone concentrations ,Growth hormone releasing hormone test ,Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1),C,The diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by inadequate suppression of GH concentrations in an oral glucose tolerance test. GH should be undetectable or less than0.6 mcg/L. Although IGF-1 concentrations are elevated these are not diagnostic and may fall during illness but can be an indicator of disease.  This is a common question in the exam and if the growth hormone supression test is available for selection this option should be chosen.

This in turn significantly increases the risk of cardiac arrhythmias. In severe hypercalcaemia J (osborn) waves can be seen. PR prolongation is possible, but is much less common than QT shortening. Ventricular fibrillation has been reported in extreme cases. Raised alkaline phosphatase associated with hypercalcaemia is more likely to be due to bony metastases; normal alkaline phosphatase raises the possibility of underlying myeloma. At this level of calcium, abdominal pain is commonly seen and there is increased risk of acute pancreatitis."

endocrine system,46,A 32-year-old male with type 1 diabetes undergoes a 24-hour urine collection. Which of the following urine albumin concentrations signifies microalbuminuria?,10 mg/day,50 mg/day,500 mg/day,1 g/day,3.5 g/day,B,Microalbuminuria is defined as a urine albumin excretion of between 30-300 mg per 24 hours. A concentration above 300 mg/24 hours signifies albuminuria and a concentration above 3.5 g/24 hours signifies overt proteinuria. Microalbuminuria is not just an indicator of early renal involvement but it also identifies increased cardiovascular risk with an approximate twofold cardiovascular risk above the already increased risk in the diabetic population. A useful surrogate of the total albumin excretion is the albumin: creatinine ratio. The urinary albumin:creatinine ratio is measured using the first morning urine sample where practicable. Microalbuminuria is indicated where there is an albumin:creatinine ratio ≥2.5 mg/mmol (men) or 3.5 mg/mmol (women). Proteinuria is indicated by a ratio of ≥30 mg/mmol.

This is caused by a maternally inherited G-protein abnormality. There is a characteristic phenotype with short stature, dysmorphic features (including short 4th or 5th metacarpals), and intellectual impairment. In addition there is resistance to a variety of hormones that act via cAMP (including PTH, TSH, and gonadotrophins). Spontaneous or paternally inherited mutations cause dysmorphic features alone. Biochemically, there is hypocalcaemia with raised PTH concentrations, raised TSH with low T4 and raised gonadotrophins. Hypocalcaemia causes paraesthesia, cramps, tetany, and carpopedal spasm; hypothyroidism causes fatigue. The mainstay of treatment is calcium and vitamin D. Sevelamer is a phosphate binder, so only really has a role in renal impairment. Cinacalcet is used in the treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Calcitonin is a second or third line therapy used in the treatment of osteoporosis. There is no evidence that the patient is magnesium deficient, so magnesium sulphate is also an inappropriate answer."

Osteoporosis is defined as less than−2.5 SD. These measurements are important as they signify a greatly increased risk of fracture. Z scores refer to the bone mineral density compared with that of a 'normal' age-matched subject.
endocrine system,53,A 51-year-old woman presented with nocturia and pruritus vulvae. Investigations revealed:    Urine dipstick analysis Glucose 2%    Which one of the following would most reliably confirm a diagnosis of diabetes mellitus?,50 g oral glucose tolerance test,Fasting plasma glucose of 6.7 mmol/L (3.0-6.0),HbA1c of 68 mmol/mol,Random plasma glucose of 8.3 mmol/L,Two hour post-prandial plasma glucose of 10 mmol/L (less than11.1),C,"The WHO guidelines are used to make a formal diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. These require the symptoms of diabetes to be present (polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss), plus:  a random venous plasma glucose of greater than11.1 mmol/L a fasting plasma glucose of greater than7 mmol/L (whole blood greater than6.1 mmol/L), or a two-hour plasma glucose concentration of greater than11.1 mmol/L two-hours after 75 g anhydrous glucose in an oral glucose tolerance test.  With no symptoms, a diagnosis requires two confirmatory samples on separate occasions. If the fasting or random values are not diagnostic, the two-hour value should be used. The WHO guidelines for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus were updated in 2011. This update states that the HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin) can be used for diagnosis, as long as assays are standardised and no exclusion criteria are met. Such exclusions include children, patients suspected of having type 1 diabetes, patients with symptoms for less than two months, patients who are acutely ill, patients taking steroids or antipsychotics (which can cause a rapid glucose rise), patients with acute pancreatic damage, and pregnant patients. An HbA1c of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) is recommended as the cut off point for a diagnosis of diabetes. A value of less than this does not preclude a diagnosis made using the traditional WHO criteria. If patients are asymptomatic, the HbA1c should be repeated. If this value is less than 48 mmol/mol the patient should be treated as high risk for developing diabetes, and the test should be repeated in 6 months (or sooner if symptoms develop). Based on these diagnostic criteria, the only correct answer listed is the raised HbA1c value."
endocrine system,54,"A 32-year-old woman presents with symptoms of palpitations, anxiety, and sleep intolerance. She had a flu-like illness some three weeks prior to presenting, and has tenderness over her neck. On examination her BP is 145/80 mmHg, her pulse is 100 and regular. She has a fine tremor and tenderness over a smoothly enlarged thyroid gland on palpation. TSH is suppressed at less than0.1. Which of the following is true of her underlying condition?",There is an association with HLA-B27,There is an association with HLA-B35,There is an association with HLA-DR3,There is an association with HLA-DR4,There is an association with HLA-DR5,B,"This presentation is typical of that associated with sub-acute or De Quervain's thyroiditis, where flu-like illness is followed by transient hyperthyroidism, then hypothyroidism, then recovery. The gland is diffusely tender, although pain responds to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Anti-thyroid drugs have no value in the management of the condition. It is associated with HLA-B35 and it is thought that a viral antigen binds to HLA-B35 molecules on macrophages. HLA-B27 is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and seronegative arthritis. DR3 and DR4 are associated with increased risk of type 1 diabetes in particular. HLA-DR5 is associated with clearance of hepatitis C infection and Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
endocrine system,55,A 45-year-old man presents with headaches and low libido. He is found to be hypopituitary. The CT scan shows a pituitary tumour with suprasellar extension. Which of the following structures is likely to be compressed?,Abducens nerve,Hypothalamus,Occulomotor nerve,Optic chiasm,Third ventricle,D,"Superior extension of the tumour can lead to compression of firstly the optic apparatus and later the hypothalamus. Lateral extension of the tumour with compression or invasion of the cavernous sinus can compromise third, fourth, or sixth cranial nerve functions, manifesting as diplopia in 5 to 15% of pituitary tumour patients. The optic chiasm lies 5-10 mm above the diaphragm sellae and anterior to the stalk. Adenomas larger than 1.5 cm frequently have suprasellar extension, and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will show compression and upward displacement of the optic chiasm."
endocrine system,56,Which of the following results would you not expect to see in a patient with anorexia nervosa?,Increased cortisol,Reduced T3 levels,Low GH levels,Low LH and FSH,Low GnRH,C,All of the above you would expect to see except for low levels of growth hormone as you would expect an increase level.
endocrine system,57,A 42-year-old man being investigated for diabetes and impotence is noted to have the following results:    Alanine aminotransferase 30 U/L (5-35)   Aspartate aminotransferase 22 U/L (1-31)   Fasting plasma glucose 7.4 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Ferritin 500 µg/L (15-300)    Which one of the following would be the next most appropriate investigation?,Bone marrow smear and iron stain,Liver biopsy,Red cell protoporphyrins,Serum transferrin receptors,Transferrin saturation,E,"This patient has a suspected diagnosis of haemochromatosis as suggested by the presentation and laboratory investigations including elevated ferritin. The next investigation would be measurement of transferrin saturation, and then, if elevated (above 45%), genotyping (homozygosity for C282y mutations) would next be considered and would be expected to clinch the diagnosis. In the event of rarer mutations, confirmation with a ferriscan may be sought or genetic testing looking for the molecular abnormalities."
endocrine system,58,A 40 year old male presents with galactorrhoea.  He is otherwise  fit and well and is not on any medication. He is found to have a prolactin level of over 2800 mU/L. An MRI is performed and reveals a lesion in the pituitary of 0.8cm. What is the treatment of choice?,Bromocriptine,Radiotherapy,Cabergoline,Only monitoring required,Surgery,C,The most likely diagnosis is microprolactinoma given the level of prolactin and the size of the tumour.  Medical management is the treatment of choice.  Cabergoline which is a dopamine agonist suppresses prolactin and is thought to be more effective than bromocriptine. Surgery is usually only indicated if there is failure of response or dopamine agonists cannot be tolerated.  Surgery in microprolactinoma carries a significant risk of hypopituitarism and recurrence and thus medical management is first line.  The aim is to restore gonadal function.
endocrine system,59,A 32-year-old woman with Graves' disease requires radioactive iodine therapy. Which of the following is correct with regard to radioactive iodine therapy?,Breast feeding should be avoided for two weeks after administration,It is an effective therapy for thyrotoxicois due to thyroiditis,It is contraindicated in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy,It produces hypothyroidism in the majority of patients treated,It should be avoided in women of childbearing age,D,RAI is an effective treatment for hyperthyroidism due to Graves' or toxic nodules. Thyroiditis involves the destruction of the thyroid follicles and release of stored thyroid hormone. Consequently iodine uptake is low and RAI is inappropriate. Its most notable side effect is hypothyroidism in 80% of those treated. It is also associated with an exacerbation of Graves' ophthalmopathy but this risk can be attenuated with the co-administration of steroids. It is very safe but is absolutely contraindicated in pregnant females. Those that are breast feeding need to stop for approximately eight weeks.
endocrine system,60,"An overweight, 60-year-old female with an eight year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with deteriorating glycaemic control. She takes gliclazide 160 mg twice daily. Investigations reveal:    Sodium and potassium Normal -   Serum urea 10 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 160 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum alanine transaminase 31 U/L (5-35)   Serum aspartate transferase 30 U/L (1-31)   HbA1c 73 mmol/mol (20-42)    Which of the following would be the most appropriate additional therapy for improved glycaemic control?",Acarbose,Guar gum,Metformin,Repaglinide,Pioglitazone,E,"This woman with diabetes has poor glycaemic control with renal impairment. With creatinine concentrations above 150 µmol/L, metformin is not recommended due to the small risk of lactic acidosis. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment would be pioglitazone, as liver function tests are normal and there is no suggestion of heart failure. It should be noted however, that given her renal impairment she should be closely monitored for fluid retention, and if this occurs, insulin is the other realistic option for her. Acarbose is poorly tolerated and is now rarely prescribed. Guar gum has little place in the treatment of diabetes. Repaglinide the non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogue would have little benefit in conjunction with a traditional SU such as gliclazide."
endocrine system,61,Which of the following features would suggest an ectopic source of ACTH as the underlying cause of Cushings syndrome?,Bowel habit change,Hyperpigmentation,Central obesity,Cough,Hypertension,B,"Although cough and bowel habit change may suggest an underlying malignancy, hyperpigmentation is much more useful. ACTH stimulates melanocytes and thus leads to hyperpigmentation. Hyperpigmentation also occurs in Addison due to the lack of negative feedback and subsequent increase in ACTH levels."

She has undergone surgery for thyroid carcinoma a week ago. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Thyroid storm,Hyperparathyroidism,Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury,External laryngeal nerve injury,Hypocalcemia,E,"Hypocalcaemia may be due to accidental parathyroid gland removal during thyroidectomy. Tingling, numbness, peraesthesia and involuntary spasm of the upper extremities are well known features of hypocalcemia. Laryngospasm is also a feature in hypocalcaemia which may cause stridor"
endocrine system,68,A 21-year-old woman is taking vasopressin replacement after developing cranial diabetes insipidus after a road traffic accident. You are concerned that she may be using excess amounts of vasopressin. Which of the following is a recognised effect of vasopressin?,Decreased factor VIII production,GI smooth muscle relaxation,Increased coronary artery blood flow,Increased platelet aggregation,Uterine smooth muscle relaxation,D,"ADH is known to increase platelet aggregation, as such it may be considered prothrombotic at high dose. Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) actually leads to increased factor VIII production, and as such may be of utility in treating some patients with haemophilia A. It leads to uterine and GI smooth muscle contraction and indirectly leads to a reduction in coronary artery blood flow."
endocrine system,69,"A 28-year-old female presents in the 24th week of pregnancy with profound tiredness and anxiety. Examination reveals a tremor, a pulse of 100 beats per minute, and a soft bruit heard over the thyroid gland. Thyroid function tests show:    Free T4 32.9 pmol/L (10-22)   TSH 0.04 mU/L (0.4-5)    Which of the following treatments would you select for this patient?",Carbimazole,Potassium perchlorate,Propanolol,Propylthiouracil,Radioactive iodine therapy,A,"This patient has Graves' disease and the most appropriate treatment for the thyrotoxicosis is Carbimazole. She should receive in the lowest dose to maintain euthyroidism. A block and replacement regime is not appropriate in pregnancy. Radioactive iodine is contraindicated as it would also be taken up by the fetal thyroid. Propranolol would ameliorate the symptoms but may impact upon the fetus. Lithium is contraindicated in pregnancy as is potassium perchlorate. Of course, surgery may also be used in severe cases. Due to the small risk of fetal abnormalities with carbimazole it is recommended to use PTU in the first trimester during organogenesis and then carbimazole in trimester 2 + 3. "
endocrine system,70,"A 40-year-old female with no prior history of thyroid disease presents with a five day history of an acutely painful, left-sided goitre. Clinically she appeared euthyroid and was apyrexial. Investigations revealed the following:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 7.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 200 ×10^9 (150-400)    Which is the most likely diagnosis?",De Quervain's thyroiditis,Haemorrhage into a cyst,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Staphylococcal abscess,Thyroid carcinoma,B,"The left side of this patient's goitre becomes acutely swollen with no other signs and FBC is normal which suggests acute haemorrhage into a cyst. Thyroid cancer is usually painless. De Quervain's thyroiditis is a diffusely tender goitre typically with systemic features such as weight loss, pyrexia and a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). An abscess would be associated with fever and pain."

Visual disturbances are suggestive of temporal arteritis not PMR, and are usually due to ischaemic changes in ciliary arteries (optic neuritis/infarction) and less commonly due to central artery occlusion. Painless loss is also less likley to be PMR associated wtih temporal arteritis Raised CK occurs in polymyositis. PMR is rare before the age of 50 years. Erythema nodosum is not classically associated with polymyalgia rheumatica."
endocrine system,73,With respect to the effect of oestrogens on the coagulation system,Levels of factor X are increased,Levels of factor VII are unchanged,Levels of anti-thrombin III are increased,Levels of factor II are decreased,The risk of thrombosis is decreased,A,"OESTROGEN - EFFECTS∙ Development of secondary sexual characteristics. Pubertal hair growth is under androgeniccontrol∙ VAGINA: Increase in size, conversion of cuboidal to stratified squamous epithelium atpuberty. Vaginal epithelial cells accumulate glycogen, their nuclei shrink and they becomecornified∙ ENDOMETRIUM - stimulates proliferation of glandular and stromal elements. Stimulates thedevelopment of progesterone receptors in endometrial cells∙ MYOMETRIUM - increases sensitivity to oxytocin∙ Increases uterine blood flow - vasodilates uterine artery∙ FALLOPIAN TUBES - proliferation of glandular tissue increased number of ciliated cells andincreased ciliary activity∙ CERVIX - increased mucus production- thin, watery and clear with a ferning pattern if driedon a slide.

What is the diagnosis?",Osteogenesis imperfect,Hypopituitarism,VSD,Achondrogenesis,Dwarfism,A,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), also known as brittle bone disease, is a group of genetic disorders that mainly affect the bones. It results in bones that break easily. OI may have joint hyperlaxity; muscle weakness; chronic, unremitting bone pain; and skull deformities (eg, posterior flattening) due to bone fragility during infancy. Limb shortening and progressive deformities can occur, and patients have a triangular face with frontal and temporal bossing; malocclusion is common. The sclera have variable hues commonly blue"
endocrine system,75,A 30-year-old female presents with mild galactorrhoea. Biochemistry reveals an elevated prolactin of 1200 mU/L (50-450) and an oestradiol concentration of 100 pmol/L (130-450). Which of the following is the likely cause?,Addison's disease,Hyperthyroidism,Non-functioning pituitary tumour (NFPT),Post-cranial irradiation for acute lymphocytic leukaemia as a child,Sheehan's syndrome,C,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is a non-functioning pituitary tumour (NFPT), which are usually non-secretory adenomas. Prolactin may be elevated due to stalk compression, which impedes the transfer of dopamine. Dopamine normally has an inhibitory action on prolactin secretion, so reduced dopamine results in increased release of prolactin from pituitary lactotropes.  Addison's may be associated with hypogonadism but prolactin concentrations are usually normal.  Severe hypothyroidism is associated with hyperprolactin hypogonadism, but this isn't typical for hyperthyroidism.  Sheehan's syndrome is associated with a low prolactin. Cranial irradiation may initially cause hyperprolactinaemia but a low prolactin is typical after a year."
endocrine system,76,A 19 year old female presents with irregular periods to her GP.  You notice she is overweight and has acne.  She admits that she has to regularly bleach her upper lip hair and has a line of hair from her umbilicus to her pubic hair which she is embarrassed about.  Her bloods reveal an elevated LH:FSH ratio and testosterone is at the high end of normal and sex hormone binding globulin is low.  Her fasting glucose is 6.2.  What Is the most likely diagnosis?,Androgen secreting tumours,Late onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Ovarian hyperthecosis,Polycystic ovarian syndrome,Exogenous testosterone,D,"PCOS is the most likely diagnosis.  It  classically presents in overweight/obese patients with acne, hirsutism, irregular menstruation and virilisation.  It is often associated with elevated LH, normal FSH and therefore elevated LH:FSH ratio.  It leads to normal or slightly elevated testosterone and low sex hormone binding globulin.  Ovarian hyperthecosis can present similarly however there is usually much more severe hirsutism and elevated testosterone. They are also much more likely to have virilisation and have a male body habitus.  Insulin resistance is thought to play a role in PCOS hence the elevated fasting glucose.  To differentiate late onset CAH 17 hydroxyprogesterone should be measured however this is much rarer.  Similarly in androgen secreting tumours and exogenous testosterone you would expect a much higher testosterone level and greater degree of virilisation."
endocrine system,77,"A 72-year-old man is found by his home help in a collapsed state. According to neighbours who spoke to paramedics, he had not been seen outside for some days.

Patients with HONK are often sensitive to insulin replacement and doses can be much lower than those required for DKA. Correction at 1 mmol/hour is too slow a correction of blood glucose, and 5 mmol/hour or greater correction of glucose is too rapid. Individual hospitals usually give sliding scale guidance, but insulin replacement of 0.15 IU/kg/hour is recommended as an initial guide. Fluid management is essential, with replacement tailored to correct significant hyperosmolarity, whilst taking account of pre-existing comorbidities such as underlying cardiovascular disease."
endocrine system,78,Which of the following is correct of prolactin (PRL)‐secreting pituitary tumours?,Regress during pregnancy,Produce homonymous hemianopia with a suprasellar extension,Tend to cause higher prolactin levels than idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia,Are usually macroadenomas at presentation,Suprasellar extension is an indication for immediate surgical intervention,C,"PRL levels above 1000 mU/L are often due to adenoma. For levels under 1000 mU/L other causes such as compression, hypophysitis, null cell adenoma, etc. should be considered. Larger tumours are usually accompanied by higher blood levels.Most prolactinoma are less than 10 mm (microprolactinoma), and rarely more than 10 mm (macroprolactinoma).The compression of the optic chiasm results typically in a bitemporal hemianopia. MRI is more sensitive to small microadenomas than CT.Generally the normal pituitary enlarges during pregnancy and a small but clinically non‐ significant enlargement is seen in microprolactinomas.Rarely, tumours enlarge during pregnancy to produce headaches and visual defects.Surgery is rarely now required even for large pituitary tumours, as these can be effectively treated with dopamine agonist therapy with rapid shrinkage, even with tumours that are compressing the optic chiasm."
endocrine system,79,A previously fit 47-year-old male presents with lower back pain from a vertebral collapse due to osteoporosis. Which of the following investigations would be the most appropriate for this man to yield a diagnosis?,Oestrogen concentration,Prostate-specific antigen concentration,Prolactin concentration,Testosterone concentration,Thyroid function tests,D,Osteoporosis in a young male would be unusual. Any symptoms or features of hypogonadism or hypercalcaemia should be elicited. Hyperprolactinaemia causes hypogonadism so a testosterone concentration would be far more relevant. Hyperthryoidism would need to be present for a considerable length of time before producing osteoporosis. Hypogonadism often goes unnoticed. Prostate malignancy does not cause osteoporosis.

Thyroid cancer associated with Graves' disease is not uncommon^1 and usually due to papillary carcinoma and must be considered in suspicious/expanding nodules rather than attributing purely to Graves' disease. Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are found in more than 70% of cases of Grave's disease^2.

endocrine system,85,When considering diabetic retinopathy which of the following statements is most accurate?,Cotton wool spots (CWS) represent infarcts of the nerve fibre layer of the retina,Haemorrhages close to the fovea are not potentially sight threatening,Hard exudates (HE) represent calcium deposites in the retina,Laser photocoagulation is applied directly to new vessels to destroy them,Microaneurysms (MA) represent sacular dilatation of retinal arterioles,A,"This correct answer is that cotton wool spots (CWS) represent infarcts of the nerve fibre layer of the retina, since multiple CWS are a pre-proliferative sign. Haemorrhages (or hard exudates ) close to the fovea represent a risk of macular oedema and are therefore sight threatening. Hard exudates (HE) are collections of exudated lipid and protein. Laser destroys ischaemic but viable retina to reduce the secretion of angiogenic growth factors and allow new vesel regression. it is not applied directly to new vessels as this would cause bleeding. Microaneurysms (MA) are capillary aneurysms."
endocrine system,86,A 62-year-old man with a 40 year history of type 1 diabetes comes to the renal clinic for review. He has been referred by his GP because of a deteriorating GFR which has now fallen to 42 ml/min. His BP is actually well controlled at 115/72 mmHg on three oral agents and a recent Hba1c was measured at 55 mmol/mol (7.2%). He has 2+ proteinuria on dipstick testing. Which of the following most accurately represents the average time his GFR will take to fall below 30 ml/min?,1 year,3 years,5 years,7 years,9 years,B,"On average, data referred to in the SIGN guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Chronic Kidney Disease on change in GFR/year suggest in patients with proteinuria, the deterioration if BP is well controlled is 4 ml/min/year. Proteinuria in the absence of reduced GFR is associated with approximately 20% progression to nephropathy over five years. Given that the progression of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with well controlled glucose and BP is established at 4 ml/min/year, all the other options apart from the second must be incorrect. More elevated glucose and BP would be associated with more rapid progression of GFR."

endocrine system,90,In a study healthy volunteers are given 50 mls of 50% dextrose solution by one of two routes. Route A is intravenous and route B is via a nasogastric tube. Every 15 minutes the plasma insulin level and glucose are measured and plotted on a graph. Which of the following statements would best describe the likely results comparing route A to route B in this experiment?,Insulin and glucose the same in route A and route B,"Insulin higher, glucose higher in route A","Insulin higher, glucose higher in route B","Insulin higher, glucose lower in route A","Insulin higher, glucose lower in route B",E,"Glucose given via the gut elicits a greater insulin response as compared to the same quantity given intravenously even though the plasma glucose peak is higher when it is given IV. This phenomenon is called the 'incretin effect'. The incretin effect denominates the phenomenon that oral glucose elicits a higher insulin response than does intravenous glucose. The two hormones responsible for the incretin effect, glucose-dependent insulinotropic hormone (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), are secreted after oral glucose loads and augment insulin secretion in response to hyperglycaemia. The investigation of the incretin effect is not usually performed using the same quantity of glucose as in this question. An 'isoglycaemic study' is often used where an infusion of glucose is designed to copy exactly the blood glucose profile generated in an individual or animal by a certain enteral glucose load. Exenatide (synthetic exendin-4) is a new agent for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exendin-4 occurs naturally in the saliva venom of the North American lizard called the Gila Monster. It mimics the action of the gut hormone GLP-1 (Glucagon-like peptide 1). "

The upregulation leads to a reduction in free fatty acids and reduces insulin resistance and improved insulin sensitivity.
endocrine system,96,"A 33-year-old male with type 1 diabetes presents with a two-day history of pain, swelling and redness in his left middle finger. This began after he pricked his finger in the garden whilst pruning a bush. His diabetic control has been quite reasonable with a HbA1c of 54 mmol/mol (20-46) on basal bolus insulin consisting of Lispro tds and Humulin I in the evenings. On examination, he has a painful, red and swollen middle finger with the redness extending to the metacarpophalangeal joint. He is diagnosed with cellulitis. Hand movements are intact. He is clinically stable with normal observations. What is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?",Admit to hospital for IV antibiotics,Oral clindamycin,Oral flucloxacillin,Oral metronidazole,Oral penicillin V,C,"The patient has digital cellulitis and the most likely organisms responsible are Strep. pyogenes or Staph. aureus. The most appropriate initial treatment is flucloxacillin, which predominantly covers Staphylococcus aureus cellulitis. If there is any suspicion of tendon involvement the plastics or orthopaedics team (depending on local policy) should be asked to review and intravenous antibiotics initiated. If he were systemically unwell when IV antibiotics would be used. Flucloxacillin is bactericidal for both Staphylococcus and Streptococcus, whereas clindamycin has a anti-toxin effect for both these groups of organisms (in addition to Clostridium perfringen). Their effect is therefore synergistic, and they should be used together where rapid control is required (e.g. in finger cellulitis) or in severe cases Intact hand movements, in this case, make this less likely, and therefore a trial of oral antibiotics is appropriate. The patient should be closely monitored, and readmitted for intravenous antibiotics should there fail to be significant improvement within 48 hours."

It may also be associated with marked weight loss. Symptoms slowly improve with improved glycaemic control. Given his HbA1c is markedly elevated at 84 mmol/mol (9.8%), insulin is the most appropriate next step. Whilst duloxetine is first line therapy and amitriptyline second line therapy for peripheral diabetic neuropathy, it is improved glycaemic control which has most effect on diabetic amyotrophy, so these are not correct options. Whilst pioglitazone would improve his diabetic control, his HbA1c is probably too elevated at 84 mmol/mol (9.8%) to enable him to reach target on triple oral therapy, therefore it is not the correct option. Whilst physiotherapy may help regain muscle strength, it is improved glycaemic control which is the most important initial therapeutic intervention."

Haemoglobin 134 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 4.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet 290 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 17 mm/1st hr (0-20)   Sodium 131 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 2.7 mmol/L (3.4-4.5)   Urea 3.0 μmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 90 mmol/L (60-110)   Bicarbonate 35 mmol/L (20-28)   Alkaline phosphotase 90 IU/L (50-110)   Bilirubin 12 μmol/L (1-22)   AST 30 IU/L (5-40)   Albumin 36 g/L (33-44)   CXR Normal -    Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?,Addison's disease,Anorexia nervosa,Conn's syndrome,Cushing's syndrome,Phaechromocytoma,B,"This patient has anorexia nervosa with vomiting, which would explain the low sodium and potassium. Although it sounds counterintuitive, several studies have shown that albumin levels remain normal in anorexia nervosa. The biological mechanism is not fully understood. If albumin levels are reduced you should look for other causes, such as occult sepsis. Addison's disease causes hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemic acidosis, whilst Cushing's disease causes hypokalaemic alkalosis. The clinical presentation does not fit with the latter. Conn's syndrome (adrenal adenoma) is associated with hypertension and hypokalaemia. "
endocrine system,119,A 16-year-old girl is diagnosed with Turner's syndrome. Which of the following autoimmune conditions is most commonly associated with Turner's?,Addison's disease,Autoimmune hepatitis,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Sjogren's syndrome,Vitamin B12 deficiency,C,"Hypothyroidism is quite common occurring in up to 24% of patients with Turner's syndrome. It is typically autoimmune in origin: Hashimoto's thyroiditis, although the exact explanation for its high prevalence is not known. "
endocrine system,120,A 45-year-old male presents with sweats and change in appearance. A diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed with failure to suppress GH concentrations on an oral glucose tolerance test. MRI reveals a 0.5 cm microadenoma of the pituitary. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapeutic option for this patient?,Depot somatostatin analogue,Dopamine agonist therapy,Pituitary surgery,Short acting somatostatin analogue,Stereotactic pituitary irradiation,C,"Surgery is the most appropriate primary therapy for acromegaly with a cure rate of above 80% expected for a tumours of this size. Although somatostatin analogues are very effective at suppressing growth hormone (GH) concentrations to what would be regarded as a 'cure' range (GH less than 5 mu/L on day profile), their expense limits use on the longer term basis. However, in patients unsuitable for surgery or in those not cured following surgery selective mini somatostatin analogue (SMS) would be employed."
endocrine system,121,A 28 year old male is diagnosed with maturity onset diabetes of the young type 2. The mutation of which gene is responsible?,IPF-1,HNF 1-alpha,HNF 1-beta,Glucokinase,HNF 4-alpha,D,MODY is typified by an early onset of diabetes with a strong family history and it is often easy to control. It is an autosomal dominant condition and at least 6 forms have been identified. MODY3 (mutation of HNF1alpha) accounts for 70% of cases of MODY and is sensitive to treatment with sulphonylureas and is most likely in this case. Often insulin treatment will ultimately be required. Mody2 is due to a mutation in glucokinase and is often associated with glucose levels of 5 to 6 mmol and is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However it is important to identify as it can lead to reduced birthweight in pregnancy. MODY 1 (mutation of HNF4alpha) is much less common and presents later. Again it is responsive to sulphonylureas although insulin may be required. MODY5 due to mutation in HNF1beta leads to renal cysts and proteinuria as well as diabetes. MODY4 (IPF1 mutation) and MODY6 due to NeuroD1 mutation are rare and little is known at present.
endocrine system,122,Which of the following is true of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?,Does not occur in type 2 diabetics,Is usually associated with hypokalaemia,Is due to unregulated glycogen breakdown from the liver,May be precipitated by metformin,May be the first presentation of Type 1 diabetes in over 25% of cases,E,"In children and adolescents DKA may be the first presentation of Type 1 diabetes in 30%-70% (these figures are very variable and depend on socio-economic factors) DKA is due to unregulated lipolysis with the release of free fatty acids hence causing the acidosis and is due to insulin insufficiency. DKA is recognised to occur in Type 2 diabetics. It may account for up to a third of admissions with DKA. It is more common in patients with latent autoimmune diabetes of adults (LADA). It is associated with:  Hyperglycaemia: glucose greater than11.1 mmol/L Acidosis: A low pH (less than7.3) Low bicarbonate (less than15 mmol/L) Severe dehydration (high urea, sodium and can occur with both low and high (usually) potassium).  It should be treated with insulin and IV fluids. "
endocrine system,123,Which of the following is the most common cause of malnutrition?,Inadequate intake of calories in any form,Inadequate intake of dietary carbohydrate,Inadequate intake of dietary fat,Inadequate intake of multiple vitamins,Inadequate intake of multiple minerals,A,"Malnutrition occurs when dietary intake is inadequate to maintain a stable weight and a healthy state. Technically, it includes over- and under-nutrition but it is most commonly used to describe under-nutrition. In clinical practice, this involves either generalised protein-calorie malnutrition or specific vitamin deficiencies. The British Association of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (BAPEN) have defined malnutrition as a state of nutrition in which a deficiency, excess, or imbalance of energy, protein, and other nutrients causes measurable adverse effects on tissue (shape, size, composition), function, and clinical outcome. Protein malnutrition is often the most serious, causing severe clinical effects and significant mortality. Clinical effects include kwashiorkor, with ascites and oedema due to extremely low concentrations of plasma proteins. Carbohydrate malnutrition is less common as carbohydrate sources are often widely grown and cheap, such as rice, pasta, bread, flour, and potatoes. Fat malnutrition rarely results in problems if there is adequate dietary protein and carbohydrate. Deficiencies of fat soluble vitamins can result with assorted clinical effects. Body size gives some indication about nutritional status. However, many obese patients eat 'faddy' diets and may have nutritional deficiencies."
endocrine system,124,"A 38-year-old lorry driver with type 2 diabetes comes to the clinic for review. He was diagnosed three years ago after changing his general practitioner, and has been treated for the past few years with metformin 1 g twice daily and gliclazide 160 mg BD. On examination he is morbidly obese with a BMI of 41. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 5.0 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 149 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 5.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 µmol/L (60-120)   HbA1c 65 mmol/mol (20-42)   8.1% (less than5.5)    According to the NICE guidelines, which of the following is the most appropriate additional therapy for him?",Exenatide,Glibencamide,Pioglitazone,Sitagliptin,Vildagliptin,A,"The preferred pathway for glucose management according to the NICE guidelines is to add insulin to the combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea. However, where weight is of particular concern (BMI greater than35), exenatide may be considered as an alternative. It can also be used where insulin would interfere with a patient's occupation. This patient's age, weight and occupation make exenatide the preferred option. Glibencamide is another sulphonylurea which is unlikely to aid glycaemic control given the patient is already on maximum dose gliclazide. The gliptins and pioglitazone are indicated if insulin therapy is unacceptable, but in the setting of obesity exenatide is likely to be more effective. "

endocrine system,126,"A 62-year-old man comes to the surgery for review. He has a history of peripheral vascular disease, characterised by intermittent claudication, particularly when he walks up a slight incline. He has a history of smoking 20 cigarettes per day. Medication includes amlodipine 10 mg, valsartan 40 mg, and atorvastatin 10 mg which he has reently started. Since commencing atorvastatin he feels lethargic and has muscle pain also. On examination his BP is 135/72 mmHg, his pulse is 82. His BMI is 32. There are trophic changes on examination of both legs consistent with chronic peripheral vascular disease. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 123 g/L (135-177)   White cells 6.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet 234 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 118 µmol/L (79-118)   HDL cholesterol 0.8 mmol/L (0.8-1.8)   LDL cholesterol 2.0 mmol/L (less than4.0)   Triglycerides 2.8 mmol/L (0.7-2.1)   Glucose 6.2 mmol/L (less than7.0)    Which of the following is the most appropriate way to impact on his cardiovascular risk?",Switch the statin for a fibrate or omega 3 fatty acids,Further reduce his blood pressure,Increase his dose of atorvastatin,Start metformin,Start pioglitazone,A,"The answer is to switch the statin for a fibrate or omega 3 fatty acids. This patient's blood pressure is relatively close to target, and increasing his blood pressure medication is unlikely to impact much further on his overall cardiovascular risk profile. Statins also result in only a modest reduction in triglycerides versus their impact on LDL cholesterol and in this case is more than likley to increase the side effects he is experiencing. Other options (metformin or pioglitazone) centre on the fact that he has impaired fasting glucose, but in reality neither agent is licensed for the treatment of pre-diabetes. As such the most appropriate option is to consider medication such as a fibrate or omega 3 fatty acids, target at triglyceride reduction. Triglycerides above 1.7 are thought to be associated with around a 30% relative increase in cardiovascular disease events."
endocrine system,127,"A 30 year old female has not had a period for several months.  She has noticed that she has put on wait, has been depressed and constipated and has noticed changes in her skin and hair.  Given the most likely cause of amenorrhoea, which of the following would you expect to observe on bloods?",Hyperprolactinaemia,Elevated FSH,Elevated LH,Low oestradiol,Elevated testosterone,A,Given the symptoms the most likely cause of amenorrhoea is hypothyroidism.  Due to the low free T4 this leads to increased TRH which also raises prolactin levels and thus can lead to amenorrhoea.

It is the only one of the commoner causes of thyrotoxicosis where radio-isotope uptake is decreased. Graves' disease and toxic multinodular goitre are associated with increased radio-isotope uptake, diffuse in the case of Graves' and within the multiple nodules in the case of toxic goitre. Thyrotoxicosis factitia and struma ovarii are associated with reduced radio-isotope uptake, but those diagnoses do not fit with the clinical picture seen here."
endocrine system,131,"In the treatment of osteoporosis, which of the following best describes the drug raloxifene?",A bisphosphonate,A calcium receptor modulator,A PTH receptor agonist,A selective oestrogen receptor modulator,An oestrogen,D,"Raloxifene is the first of the so-called selective oestrogen receptor modulators. There are fundamentally two types of oestrogen receptor, alpha and beta, distributed at locations such as breast, uterus, bone and in the vasculature. Raloxifene acts as an oestrogen agonist at some sites, for example, bone to increase mineralisation, but acts as an antagonist at other sites, for example, uterus/breast (preventing endometrial/breast hyperplasia). It differs from tamoxifen in this regard, because tamoxifen (another SERM) acts as a partial agonist at the endometrium, so can promote endometrial hyperplasia."

He has noticed he is easily bruising and there is evidence of striae. He is found to be hypertensive and hypokalaemic. Which investigation should be performed initially?,Low dose dexamethasone suppression test,ACTH measurement,Urinary catecholamines,High dose dexamethasone,CT Head and abdomen,A,This patient is likely to have Cushings syndrome and thus urinary cortisol and low dose dexamethasone should be performed in the first instance to confirm this is the case. High dose dexamethasone and ACTH measurement provide further information about the likely underlying cause as in whether is is ACTH dependent or independent. If it is thought to be ACTH independent then an adrenal gland CT scan is useful. If not an MRI of the pituitary should be performed to assess if there is an adenoma and thus Cushings disease.

She does not want to inject a PTH analogue or denosumab. Which of the following correctly describes one of the actions of calcitonin?,Decreased osteoclast activity,Increased bone turnover,Increased osteoclast activity,Increased urinary hydroxyproline excretion,Increased urinary sodium excretion,A,"Exogenous calcitonin inhibits osteoclast activity, and is associated with a 1-2% increase in BMD which is sustained for up to five years. Calcitonin is associated with a marked decrease in bone turnover, and consequently a decrease in urinary hydroxyproline excretion. In the absence of ADH, calcitonin increases sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chloride tubular resorption, thereby reducing their urinary excretion. It also decreases urinary hydroxyproline excretion."
endocrine system,142,Which gut hormone is made in the I cells of the duodenum and jejunum?,Cholecystokinin (CCK),Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP),Gastrin,Secretin,Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),A,"Gastrin is released by G cells of the gastric antrum and duodenum. Secretin is released by S cells of the granular mucosa of the duodenum. VIP is predominantly found in the nervous system and gut and is considered a neurotransmitter. Cholecystokinin (CCK) is made in I cells of duodenum, jejunum and enteric nerves. It is structurally similar to gastrin. Actions:  promotes gallbladder contraction and intestinal motility increases secretion of pancreatic enzymes including insulin, glucagons, pancreatic polypeptides role in satiety, and short half life, less than three minutes, cleared by the kidneys.  Stimulus for secretion:  mixtures of polypeptides and amino acids especially phenylalanine and tryptophan stimulate release but undigested protein does not gastric acid entering duodenum fatty acids, especially in micelles secretion inhibited by somatostatin.

Which of the following causes of adrenal insufficiency would you NOT expect hyper pigmentation to be a clinical feature of?,Autoimmune adrenalitis,Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome,Adrenal dysgenesis,Secondary adrenal insufficiency45%,Primary adrenal insufficiency,D,"Autoimmune adrenalitis, adrenal dysgenesis and Waterhouse Friderichsen syndrome are all causes of primary adrenal insufficiency.In Primary adrenal insufficiency the brain produces more ACTH in response to low steroid hormone levels. ACTH gets cleaved into MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) which causes hyper pigmentation i.e. High ACTH = High MSH = hyper pigmentation.In secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency there is low ACTH and low adrenal steroid hormone production as a result. Addison's & Adrenal Insufficiency Addison's BasicsAddison's disease or chronic adrenal insufficiency is a rare endocrine disorder where the adrenals produce insufficient steroid hormones. The term Addison's refers to primary adrenal insufficiency i.e. the adrenals themselves are the source of low steroid hormone production. There are several causes of this autoimmune adrenalitis being the most common.Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency refer to insufficient adrenal hormone production due to a cause external to the kidney i.e:Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient ACTH production by the pituitary Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient CRH production by the hypothalamusSigns & SymptomsHypotension Hyperpigmentation (this is due to increased ATCH production) Myalgia Arthralgia Weight loss Anxiety/personality change Coma in Addisons crisisBiochemical featuresHypercalcemia Hypoglycemia Hyponatremia Hyperkalemia Eosinophilia and lymphocytosis Metabolic acidosis"
endocrine system,145,A 35-year-old woman comes to the endocrine clinic for review. She has suffered a left Colles' fracture and attends for osteoporosis assessment. Which of the following factors would put her at increased risk?,Early menarche,Europid ethnic origin,Family history of osteoporotic fracture,Five units/week alcohol consumption,Use of a thiazide,C,"A family history of osteoporotic fracture is a known risk for osteoporosis. This may be related to inherited differences in bone structure which put the patient at increased risk. Early menarche and late menopause are associated with reduced risk of fracture. Europid ethnic origin is associated with a reduced risk of osteomalacia versus populations with increased skin pigmentation. Alcoholism is associated with osteoporosis, whereas alcohol consumption within recommended limits is not. Thiazide diuretics increase serum calcium and are not associated with risk of osteoporosis."

Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Cushing's syndrome,Hypothyroidism,Macroprolactinoma,Microprolactinoma,Type 2 diabetes,B,"The clinical scenario here would be consistent with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is not an uncommon cause of hyperprolactinaemia and should be part of the work up of all patients with an elevated prolactin. Significant hypothyroidism can result in raised levels of TRH (thyrotropin-releasing factor). This can act as prolactin-releasing factor and bind to the receptors, resulting in the release of prolactin and hyperprolactinaemia. A bulky pituitary gland on CT scan is not a significant finding and an MRI of the pituitary is required to delineate the anatomy of the pituitary gland. The level of prolactin would be higher if the diagnosis was a micro or macroprolactinoma. The history is not one of Cushing's syndrome, or type 2 diabetes."
endocrine system,148,"A 17-year-old female with type 1 diabetes, who is known to be poorly compliant with treatment, is admitted with diabetic ketoacidosis. The respiratory rate is 41 per minute and the blood pressure 85/66 mmHg. She is confused and lethargic. An arterial blood gas shows the pH to be 7.01, and the potassium is 4.9 mmol/l. Which condition carries the highest risk of mortality to this patient?",Cerebral oedema,Cerebrovascular accident,Myocardial infarction,Seizure,Ventricular tachycardia,A,"The risk of mortality in some reported series of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is 5%. The incidence of cerebral oedema in paediatric patients treated for DKA is approximately 1%. The risk of cerebral oedema is highest in paediatric and adolescent patients, and is rarer in adults. The rate of fluid, sodium, and insulin replacement seems not to be related to the development of cerebral oedema, and often its development may be idiosyncratic. Thus the warning signs of cerebral oedema - headache, lethargy, confusion, reduced conscious level, incontinence, pupillary changes - must be considered in this patient group. Ventricular tachycardia is a theoretical risk in the presence of hypokalaemia, which is not present at this stage. Seizures may occur as a consequence of the underlying cerebral oedema."

endocrine system,152,An 18-year-old female with polycystic ovary syndrome was prescribed metformin. What is the most important pharmacological action of metformin in this situation?,Increasing gluconeogenesis,Increasing insulin levels,Increasing luteinising hormone levels,Increasing oestradiol levels,Increasing peripheral glucose uptake,E,"The biguanide metformin both inhibits the production of hepatic glucose, thereby decreasing insulin secretion, and also enhances insulin sensitivity at the cellular level. Thus, lowering serum insulin concentrations with metformin ameliorates hyperandrogenism by reduction of ovarian enzyme activity that results in ovarian androgen production. Clinical studies have shown that metformin reduces insulin resistance and have demonstrated a fall in serum androgens, luteinising hormone and weight. The reduced insulin resistance is associated with reduced insulin drive to the insulin sensitive ovary in polycystic ovarian syndrome and hence reduces androgen production. "
endocrine system,153,"A 54-year-old man comes to the cardiovascular prevention clinic for review. He is obese with hypertension and an LDL cholesterol of 3.1 mmol/l. His GP has also checked two fasting glucoses which are 6.3 and 6.2 mmol/l. On examination his BP is 138/82, pulse is 78 and regular. His BMI is 36. Neurological examination including sensory testing is normal. Which of the following is the next best step in management of this patient?",He should be counselled with regard to exercise and lifestyle,He should be started on dapagliflozin,He should be started on liraglutide,He should be started on metformin,He should be referred for bariatric surgery,A,"The answer is he should be counselled with regard to exercise and lifestyle. This gentleman has impaired fasting glucose, defined as a fasting plasma glucose ≥6.1mmol/l but less than7.0mmol/l. A number of studies have shown that intensive diet and lifestyle change can reduce progression from impaired fasting glucose (or impaired glucose tolerance) to frank type 2 diabetes by approximately 50%. Both metformin and liraglutide reduce progression to type 2 diabetes in patients with obesity and impaired glucose handling, although they would only be considered for patients unable to lose weight/improve their risk profile by diet and lifestyle measures. As yet neither agent is endorsed by NICE for diabetes prevention, patients unable to lose significant amounts of weight may however be considered for bariatric surgery, (BMIgreater than35 with other significant comorbidities). Dapagliflozin is used in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes but not for its prevention. "

However, the intestinal absorption of calcium is facilitated by 1,25 dihydroxy-vitamin D, which stimulates the microvillous membrane of the enterocyte to synthesise the calcium-binding carrier protein necessary for active calcium ion absorption."
endocrine system,156,Which of the following is true of radioactive iodine (^131I) therapy?,Causes a deterioration in ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves' disease,Causes hypothyroidism in 90% of treated patients within three months,Is associated with a subsequently increased risk of infertility,Is associated with an increased risk of thyroid lymphoma,Is the preferred treatment in amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis,A,"RAI is associated with the induction of hypothyroidism in the majority of subjects by three months (70%) with 10% failing at the first dose at about 18 months. It may precipitate deterioration in ophthalmopathy in patients with Graves'. There is no evidence of increased risk of lymphoma after RAI. Radioactive iodine treatment does hold a small risk of reduced fertility in men who undergo mulitple treatments, but not a subsequently increased risk as referred to in the question. Treatment is not thoght to affect fertility in women. Withdrawing amiodarone is the preferred treatment in amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis and often the iodine uptake would be low in these patients making ^131I therapy unhelpful."
endocrine system,157,A patient is receiving treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (GH). Which of the following is a recognised side effect of GH therapy?,Melanoma,Osteoporosis,Prolongation of the QT interval,Prostatic hypertrophy,Raised intracranial pressure,E,"There are numerous side effects associated with treatment with recombinant human growth hormone. Raised ICP with normal MRI (a secondary form of idiopathic intracranial hypertension [IIH]) is thought to result from the antidiuretic effect of hGH and is most common in those patients who also have impaired renal homeostasis. In patients with intact homeostatic mechanisms, hGH results in elevation of plasma renin and aldosterone which counteracts the antidiuretic effect. If IIH is diagnosed, hGH treatment should be interrupted and reinstated at a lower dose if IIH resolves. Other recognised side effects of hGH include: slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE), malignancies, gynaecomastia, and impaired glucose metabolism. Melanoma, osteoporosis, prostatic hypertrophy, and prolongation of the QT interval are not commonly recognised side effects. "

endocrine system,161,"A 34-year-old man presents with a six month history of tiredness, weight gain, and cold intolerance. On examination he appeared hypothyroid and had a firm goitre. Investigations reveal:    Free T4 6 pmol/L (10-22)   TSH 55 mU/L (0.4-5.0)    Which is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",de Quervain's thyroiditis,Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,Iodine deficiency,Pendred syndrome,Primary atrophic hypothyroidism,B,"Irrespective of gender, the most likely diagnosis in this hypothyroid man is Hashimoto's disease. Iodine deficiency is extremely unlikely in the United Kingdom and elevated de Quervain's thyroiditis would be associated with acute presentation with a painful goitre, raised temperature and weight loss. Thyroid function tests (TFTs) may be transiently abnormal often high but hypothyroidism may ensue. Pendred syndrome is hypothryoidism due to dyshormonogenesis, goitre and sensorineural deafness. Atrophic hypothyroidism would not be associated with goitre."
endocrine system,162,A 19 year old female presents with irregular periods to her GP.  You notice she is overweight and has acne.  She admits that she has to regularly bleach her upper lip hair and has a line of hair from her umbilicus to her pubic hair which she is embarassed about.  Her bloods reveal an elevated LH:FSH ratio and testosterone is at the high end of normal and sex hormone binding globulin is low.  Her fasting glucose is 6.2.  Which of the following would be most useful in the treatment?,Clomiphene,Orlistat,Progesterone only pill,Metformin,Combined oral contraceptive,D,"PCOS is the most likely diagnosis.  It  classically presents in overweight/obese patients with acne, hirsutism, irregular menstruation and virilisation.  It is often assocaited with elevated LH, normal FSH and therefore elevated LH:FSH ratio.  It leads to normal or slightly elevated testosterone and low sex hormone binding globulin.Insulin resistance is thought to play a role in PCOS hence the elevated fasting glucose.  Metformin is useful in this case as it has been shown to reduce androgen levels (thus improve hirsutism and acne) and will also be useful as there is clear evidence of impaired glucose tolerance and will improve the insulin resistance associated with PCOS. It may also improve ovulatory function. Combined oral contraceptive is also useful but given the fasting glucose metformin would probably be more beneficial."
endocrine system,163,With respect to thyroid hormones,The fetal thyroid gland does not produce thyroxine until after 20 weeks gestation,50% of fetal thyroxine requirement is from trans placental transfer of maternal thyroxine,The fetal thyroid gland produces thyroxine from 12 weeks gestation,The half-life of T3 is longer than that of T4,The half life of T4 is about 6 minutes,C,"PROTEIN BINDING• Highly protein bound to thyroxine binding globulin (70%), thyroxine binding pre-albumin(~20%) and albumin (~10%).

As such it blocks both the effects of aldosterone and testosterone, and is known to cause gynaecomastia. Used in this situation, it can help control blood pressure prior to surgery and reduce operative risk. Amiloride may be useful in treating hypokalaemia, but it is not a mineralocorticoid antagonist, as such it is not the correct choice here. Indapamide may have utility as an anti-hypertensive agent, but it may worsen hypokalaemia. Furosemide is a more effective treatment for heart failure than blood pressure. Valsartan is less effective than spironolactone in reducing blood pressure in this situation."

How often should there TFTs be measured for dose alteration?,Weekly,6 monthly,6 weekly,Monthly,2 monthly,D,When altering the dose of thyroxine it takes several weeks for levels to stabilise and thus TFTs should be measured monthly.
endocrine system,169,A 48-year-old lady with Addison's disease presented in a small peripheral clinic. She says that she has run out of her hydrocortisone and she usually takes 20 mg in the morning and 10 mg in the evening. No hydrocortisone is available at the clinic but you do have prednisolone which you would like to prescribe instead until a prescription of hydrocortisone can be dispensed. Which of the following is the equivalent daily dose of prednisolone?,2.5 mg,5 mg,7.5 mg,10 mg,20 mg,C,1 mg is equivalent to 4 mg hydrocortisone so this lady should be given 7.5 mg. If 2.5 mg tablets were not available (to go with a 5 mg tablet to make 7.5 mg tablet) then 10 mg would be fine. It is better to overdose rather than under-dose especially where there is stress or illness.

The CT report reveals that he has a 1.3 cm macroadenoma which does not encroach upon the optic chiasm. On recovery he is perfectly well and examination is entirely normal, including full viusal fields to confrontation. Investigations reveal normal thyroid function, testosterone concentration, and short Synacthen test results. His prolactin concentration is 550 mU/L (50-450). Which of the follwoing is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",Advise trans-sphenoidal hypophysectomy,Arrange pituitary radiotherapy,Arrange serial imaging,No further investigation/treatment required,Treat with cabergoline,C,"This man has a coincidentally detected pituitary macroadenoma. The small elevation in prolactin probably reflects stalk compression and does not indicate that this is a prolactinoma. In macroprolactinomas, the prolactin concentration is greater than 2000 mU/L. In this man's case, with no visual field defects and the tumour being distant from the chiasm, the most appropriate treatment would be observation with serial scanning to assess for any change in size that would then merit surgical intervention. However, this man, who is eupituitary may never encounter any growth in this coincidentally detected non-functional pituitary tumour."

Guidelines currently suggest that metformin should be stopped if creatinine is above 150 µmol/L. The estimated prevalence of life-threatening lactic acidosis is one to five cases per 100,000, with mortality in reported cases up to 50%. Traditionally, this complication has been thought of as secondary to an accumulation of the drug. Metformin is excreted unchanged in the urine, with the half-life prolonged and renal clearance decreased in proportion to any decrease in creatinine clearance. This may occur chronically in chronic renal impairment, or acutely with dehydration, shock, and intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents, all of which have the potential to alter renal function. Tissue hypoxia also has a significant role, and acute or chronic conditions that may predispose to this condition, such as sepsis, acute myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, cardiac failure and chronic liver disease, may act as triggers. As the patient appears to have chronic renal impairment and as she has been on ramipril for a considerable period it is unlikely that she has renal artery stenosis requiring the withdrawal of the ACEi."

endocrine system,181,A 54-year-old man comes to the clinic for review of type 2 diabetes. He is noted to have a BMI of 33 and a particularly elevated waist/hip ratio. You suspect that he has elevated central adiposity. Which of the following markers fits best with increased central adiposity?,Low alanine aminotransferase,Low plasma urate,Raised HDL cholesterol,Raised LDL cholesterol,Raised triglycerides,E,"The answer is raised triglycerides. Raised triglycerides are indicative of disordered free fatty acid handling, a sign of inability of fat cells to store lipid; this is associated with peripheral insulin resistance and abnormal glucose levels. Disordered free fatty acid handling is associated with increased central fat, increased cardiovascular risk, and hepatic steatosis. Weight loss is an important treatment option in this case. In such cases you should consider looking for other features of the metabolic syndrome."

Thankfully, surgical juniors are well aware of the signs of hypocalcaemia and its treatment.  Infection is seen in 1-2% of patients undergoing thyroidectomy. Bleeding is less common, seen in around 0.5% or less of patients undergoing the operation. Bleeding risks have fallen significantly due to improvements in surgical technique. Permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy occurs in 1% of patients; superior laryngeal nerve palsy affects more patients (3-4% in case series)."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Adhesive capsulitis,Referred pain from subdiaphragmatic irritation,Rotator cuff tear,Shoulder dislocation,Supraspinatus tendinitis,A,"Adhesive capsulitis is a recognised musculoskeletal complication of diabetes. Often referred to as 'frozen shoulder', adhesive capsulitis is characterised by pain and restricted movement of the shoulder, usually in the absence of intrinsic shoulder disease. Night pain is often present in the affected shoulder. Adhesive capsulitis occurs more commonly in women after age 50. Pain and stiffness usually develop gradually over several months to a year but progress rapidly in some patients. Pain may interfere with sleep. The shoulder is tender to palpation, and both active and passive movements are restricted. Radiographs of the shoulder show osteopenia. The diagnosis is confirmed by arthrography.

Which one of the following statements is correct?,He may have Conn's syndrome,He should be treated with IV hypertonic saline,His daily sodium requirement is 5 mmol/kg,His electrolyte abnormality may be caused by bendroflumethiazide,Hydrocortisone (1 mg/kg) should be given every eight hours and the oral fluid intake restricted to 1.5 litres per day,D,"Hyponatraemia is a serum sodium less than135 mmol/L. In the scenario above, a sodium of 120 mmol/L is an indication to delay the scheduled surgery until the underlying cause has been treated. There are numerous causes, for example:  Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) secretion Diuretic therapy Hypoadrenalism, and Hypothyroidism.  However, the most frequent cause of hyponatraemia in preoperative trauma patients is intravenous administration of sodium deficient fluids, particularly 5% glucose, which is just water and glucose. The normal maintenance sodium requirement is 1-2 mmol/kg per day. Therefore, the selection of intravenous fluids should be based on the weight of the patient in kilograms together with knowledge of the electrolyte content of the various crystalloid solutions. Correction of hyponatraemia should be slow if the problem is chronic, in order to reduce the risk of pontine lesions and subdural haemorrhages. The use of hypertonic saline should be restricted to treating severe cases, that is, less than115 mmol/L."

endocrine system,191,A 47-year-old male presents with marked shortness of breath which has deteriorated over the last two weeks. On examination he has a hard irregular thyroid mass and has some difficulty breathing. There appears to be no retrosternal extension and he appears clinically euthyroid. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Anaplastic carcinoma of thyroid,Bleed into a thyroid nodule,Follicular thyroid carcinoma,Medullary thyroid carcinoma,Multinodular goitre,A,This patient is likely to have anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid with compression/infiltration of the trachea causing the shortness of breath. Bleeding into a thyroid nodule is usually associated with a rapid onset of pain. Follicular thyroid carcinoma would be unlikely to produce such marked infiltrative features in such a short period of time. Typically patients with follicular disease would present with a nodule and/or distal metastases (lung and bone) or local infiltration. Medullary thyroid cancer is associated most often with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II and would be particularly unusual. This is unlikely to be a multinodular goitre as this would be unlikely to compress the trachea unless retrosternal. The description is more compatible with a thyroid malignancy as it has deteriorated rapidly.

Ideally premature menopause should be defined as two standard deviations below the mean estimated for the reference population. Many gynaecologists consider menopause before 45 years of age as premature but the UK definition is before 40. Menopause NICE published guidelines on Diagnosis & Management of Menopause in November 2015 (NG23).

This patient has a raised thyroid-stimulating hormone but normal total thyroxine (T4) and a low tri-iodothyronine (T3). Either there is a block on the conversion of T4 to T3 or as seems more likely the patient has taken the T4 just prior to coming to clinic. The explanation is non-compliance.

Hyponatraemia may contribute to a worsening of confusion and agitation and even convulsions where the sodium falls precipitously low. Addison's seems unlikely in the absence of any elevation in potassium and no signs of hypovolaemia. Similarly both dehydration and psychogenic polydypsia are not appropriate answers because the BP is not low and there are no signs of dehydration, and we have no history of polyuria. Given that we are not presented with the results of urine testing, glomerulonephritis is not a correct option."
endocrine system,198,You are trialling a new dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitor which you believe may have greater specificity for the DPPIV enzyme than other members of the class and therefore offer advantages for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Which of the following correctly reflects one aspect of the mode of action of DPPIV inhibition?,Glucose dependent glucagon suppression,Glucose dependent insulin suppression,Increased GI motility,Increased release of GIP,Increased release of GLP-1,A,"DPPIV inhibitors reduce natural degradation of incretins, leading to increased levels of GLP-1. This results in suppression of glucagon, but at glucose levels consistent with hypoglycaemia, glucagon is not suppressed. This means that the glucose control afforded by DPPIV inhibition is not associated with hypoglycaemia when the drugs are used in monotherapy. DPPIV inhibitors enhance the incretin effect which is a peak of insulin release associated with an oral glucose load; as such they are associated with glucose dependent insulin stimulation. They are associated with reduced gastrointestinal motility; they are weight neutral when used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPPIV inhibitors do not increase the release of incretins, merely interfere with their breakdown."

Which of the following are likely consequences of his Klinefelter's?,Increased bone mineral density,Increased libido,Increased percentage of free testosterone,Low HDL cholesterol,Low LDL cholesterol,D,"Low HDL cholesterol is recognised to be associated with low levels of sex steroids and is a feature of Klinefelter's syndrome. Klinefelter's is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and this at least in part may stem from abnormalities in lipid metabolism. Klinefelter's is associated with a decrease in libido and men with the condition often find it very difficult to form lasting relationships. Bone mineral density is decreased, and they are at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels may be normal or increased, and triglyceride levels are often elevated. Overall testosterone levels are low; Klinefelter's itself does not impact on the fraction which is protein bound however."

On examination her BP is 150/80 mmHg, her pulse is 52 and she has a BMI of 29. She has thinning hair. Investigations show:    TSH 9 IU (0.5-4.5)   Free T4 10.2 nanomol/l (10-24)   Total cholesterol 6.2 mmol/l (less than5.2)   Anti-TPO Antibody positive    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Atorvastatin 10 mg,Carbimazole 10 mg,Reassurance,Thyroxine 50 mcg,Thyroxine 100 mcg,D,"This patient's symptoms are consistent with subclinical hypothyroidism. She is at significant risk of becoming clinically hypothyroid with a thyroxine (T4) below the lower limit of normal over the next few months. Her weight gain and lethargy necessitate replacement with low dose thyroxine at this stage, aiming to titrate therapy until the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is within the normal range. Atorvastatin is not an appropriate treatment because this patient's raised total cholesterol is likely to be related at least in part to her hypothyroidism which should be treated first. Carbimazole has no value in the treatment of hypothyroidism. Reassurance is not appropriate given this patient has symptoms. 100 mcg is too high an initial starting dose for thyroxine, given her T4 is at the lower limit of the normal range."
endocrine system,201,"Which drug, in addition to his metformin and gliclazide, should be given to a patient with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with a high urinary albumin excretion?",Insulin,Bisoprolol,Ramipril,Aspirin,Losartan,C,ACE Inhibitors have been shown to reduce the progression of microalbuminuria to diabetic nephropathy and thus should be utilised.  Losartan is an angiotensin receptor II blocker and should only be utilised if an ACE Inhibitors is not tolerated.  Obviously good control of diabetes is also important.

HbA1c levels will be monitored in clinic every 3-6 months but there is no recommendation on at home monitoring of levels. With respect to insulin titration however, self-monitored blood glucose results play a crucial part in appropriate dose adjustment. The consensus recommends a target of between 3.9 and 7.2 mmol/L for fasting and pre-prandial glucose levels. If fasting levels are in range yet the HbA1c is elevated, post-prandial monitoring is recommended, aiming for glucose levels of less than 10 mmol/L."

These potentiate glucose-stimulated insulinsecretion • Gastro-intestinal hormones - Gastrin, Gastric inhibitory peptide, Secretin, Cholecystokinin • Other hormones - cortisol, growth hormone, glucagon (indirectly through increased glucose),progesterone and oestrogen to a lesser extent• Fatty acids have little effect on insulin secretion• Fasting insulin levels are higher in pregnancy compared to non-pregnancy• When glucose is given orally, a greater insulin response is elicited than when it is administeredintravenously • Insulin secretion in response to a glucose load is bi-phasic: an early rise (phase 1) - release ofavailable insulin late rise (phase 2) - synthesis of new insulin. Plasma insulin peaks 30-60 minutesafter a meal• Sympathetic stimulation inhibits insulin secretion"

She has not lost any weight and has not had a menstrual period for the past six months. On examination her BP is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 65 bpm and regular. Her BMI is 23 kg/m^2. She has normal breast development, normal axillary and pubic hair. Routine full blood count, Uandamp;E, LFT and TFTs checked by the GP are normal, as are multiple urine pregnancy tests. Which of the following is likely to be the most useful next investigation?",FSH,Oestrogen,Prolactin,Testosterone,Trans vaginal USS,A,"The suspicion here, given the prolonged cessation of menses with a normal weight, normal thyroid function tests, and a past history of coeliac disease is premature ovarian failure, thought to be autoimmune in origin. As such looking for elevated FSH (28 is the upper limit of normal, 40 is the value required to confirm menopause) is the optimal next investigation. Unfortunately spontaneous return of ovarian function is extremely rare. Therefore this patient in all likelihood should be offered hormone replacement therapy. Although oestrogen may be low, it is not particularly useful in identifying the underlying cause. Hyperprolactinaemia is a possible differential, but the history of previous autoimmune pathology points us more towards premature ovarian failure rather than hyperprolactinaemia. Testosterone is a useful investigation where there are signs of virilisation and either PCOS or adrenal pathology is suspected. As such it is not useful here. Similarly, USS is useful to confirm the presence of polycystic ovaries, although that is unlikely as the underlying diagnosis."

Felty's syndrome is a complication of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), defined as the triad of RA, neutropenia, and splenomegaly. It is rare, and is most commonly seen in those with severe disease of more than 10 years duration. The cause is unknown, but it is linked with the HLA-DR4 genotype. 95% of patients are positive for rheumatoid factor. Felty's can be asymptomatic, or can present with recurrent infections. The neutropenia is often severe (less than0.2), which can lead to serious (and sometimes fatal) infections. Extra-articular features of RA are often present. Hepatomegaly and lymphadenopathy may be present. The diagnosis is clinical. Rarely, splenic rupture, hyperviscosity, and leukaemia can complicate the condition. Treatment is with immunomodulators, usually methotrexate. Alternative options are hydroxychloroquine, ciclosporin, leflunomide, and cyclophosphamide. Rituixmab has been trialled with some success, but enteracept has been linked with a reduction in neutrophil count. Splenectomy is generally reserved for those not responding to medical treatment. Patients should be immunised against influenza and pneumococcus if the neutropenia persists for more than a couple of weeks. Methotrexate toxicity is the major differential, but the splenomegaly and evidence of active inflammation makes Felty's the more likely diagnosis. Whilst haematological malignancies are also possible differentials, they would not be top of the list ahead of Felty's. However, a bone marrow biopsy could be indicated if symptoms and signs fail to improve with intensification of immunomodulator therapy."

It has been shown to normalise insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels in 90-100% of patients with a history of acromegaly. Growth hormone levels increase during treatment and no decrease in tumour size is seen, as such the major use of pegvisomant is in patients who have an inadequate response to surgery or radiotherapy. Growth hormone antagonists used prior to surgery improve metabolic risk factors for surgery, such as hypertension and hyperglycaemia, as such even use over a few weeks before adenomectomy may impact positively on morbidity / mortality associated with surgery. Prolactin may be elevated due to mass effect, and risk of colonic carcinoma is elevated in patients with acromegaly. Growth hormone secretion is pulsatile, as such it may not always be elevated, and therefore IGF-1 is a better screening test for acromegaly."

endocrine system,213,Osteomalacia may be expected in which of the following?,Auto-immune adrenalitis ,Mercury poisoning ,Pernicious anaemia ,Pseudo-hypoparathyroidism,Sarcoidosis ,B,"Osteomalacia may occur with vitamin D deficiency. Mercury poisoning or any heavy metal poisoning causes an acquired Fanconi syndrome with proximal (type 2) renal tubular acidosis. Fanconi syndrome is a disorder of the renal proximal tubules that results in decreased reabsorption of phosphorus and amino acids accompanied by metabolic acidosis secondary to proximal tubular bicarbonate wasting. Serum calcium is usually normal, alkaline phosphatase is elevated and serum 1,25(OH)2D is inappropriately low or low normal. Phosphate is also low. This can lead to osteomalacia or Ricketts. Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune condition of the GI system leading to impaired absorption of B12 and macrocytic anaemia due to antibodies against intrinsic factor. Sarcoidosis is characterised by non-caseating granulomas often involving hilar lymph nodes, though not confined to them, leading to hypercalcaemia, itch and other immune symptoms. Pseudo-hypoparathyroidism is an inherited disorder in which the tissue of the body do not respond to parathyroid hormone."

The most marked abnormality on examination is a short fifth digit on each hand. Investigations reveal a calcium of 2.05 mmol/l (2.20-2.61), and a phosphate of 1.8 mmol/l (0.8-1.5). Which of the following abnormalities is most likely to be present?",Alpha subunit G protein mutation,Beta subunit G protein mutation,Gamma subunit G protein mutation,Renal tubular disorder,Vitamin D receptor mutation,A,"The PTH receptor is a G protein receptor, and mutations in the alpha subunit lead to elevated levels of PTH, but a loss of function, resulting in hypocalcaemia. Abnormalities of other G protein receptors may also occur, including abnormalities of the thyroid receptor which lead to development of hypothyroidism. Mutations in the other G protein subunits do not occur in pseudohypoparathyroidism, so the beta and gamma subunit G protein mutation options are incorrect. Whilst a renal tubular disorder or vitamin D receptor mutation could in theory lead to hypocalcaemia, the short digit seen in this patient is characteristic of pseudohypoparathyroidism."

Investigations during the follicular phase:    Serum androstenedione 10.1 nmol/L (0.6-8.8)   Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate 11.6 µmol/L (2-10)   Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone 18.6 nmol/L (1-10)   Serum oestradiol 380 pmol/L (200-400)   Serum testosterone 2.6 nmol/L (0.5-3)   Plasma luteinising hormone 3.3 U/L (2.5-10)   Plasma follicle-stimulating hormone 3.6 U/L (2.5-10)    Which is the next most appropriate investigation?",24 hour urinary free cortisol,CT scan of adrenals,GnRH test,Short Synacthen test with measurement of 17 hydroxy progesterone (17OHP),Ultrasound scan of ovaries,D,"In this case the patient has features that would suggest polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) yet the 17OHP concentration is elevated and is compatible with non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). Congenital adrenal hyperplastia is caused by an inherited defect in the cortisol and/or aldosterone biosynthetic pathways. Non-classical forms result from milder enzyme dysfunction and therefore manifest later in life (adolescence or adulthood). The most common form is due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, but it can also result from 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency. The clinical presentation may be indistinguisable from polycystic ovarian syndrome, with hirtusism being a dominant feature. The synacthen stimulation test can evaluate adrenal gland function, and when 17-OHP levels are measured concurrently, can help to distinguish between PCOS and non-classical CAH. N-CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is diagnosed with the ACTH-stimulated 17-OHP levles are more than 30 nmol/L (although this value varies with the assay used). If this is diagnosed, antiandrogens can be used to treat hirsutism, but glucocorticoids are generally not required."
endocrine system,218,"A 38 year old female has difficult to control hypertension.  She has intermittently suffered from headaches and anxiety.  She is due to undergo abdominal surgery.  Given the underlying diagnosis, which treatment should be performed before her surgery?",Nil required,Introduction of an irreversible alpha blocker,Introduction of a beta blocker,IV fluid administration,Increase dosage of antihypertensives,B,This patient is likely to have an undiagnosed Phaeochromocytoma.  The administration of irreversible alpha blockers must be done prior to surgery as mobilisation or manipulation of the tumour can lead to a massive surge in catecholamine release and lead to malignant hypertension..
endocrine system,219,A 26-year-old male body builder is referred to the clinic by his general practitioner (GP). He and his wife have been trying to conceive for three years. The GP found him to be azospermic. An MRI of the pituitary demonstrates no abnormality. The results of his initial investigations are shown below:    TSH 3.7 pmol/L (0.5-5.0)   T4 11.1 pmol/L (12.5-25.0)   IGF-1 16.1 nmol/L (9-36)   LH less than1.0 IU/L (3.6-17.1)   FSH less than1.0 IU/L (2.25-20)   Testosterone 16.0 nmol/L (9-34.7)    Which is the likely diagnosis?,Anabolic steroid use,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,Kallman's syndrome,Non-functioning pituitary adenoma,Testicular teratoma,A,"The most likely diagnosis is steroid induced hypogonadism. Body builders may be involved in the illicit use of anabolic and androgenic steroids. These results are consistent with ongoing use of androgens. The hypogonadism, if persistent, may be treated with human chorionic gonadotropin. In the event of a non-functioning pituitary tumour, the testosterone would be low together with the luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pituitary would not miss this diagnosis. The growth hormone (GH) axis would also be likely to be suppressed, and a low insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 would result. In the event of androgen insensitivity, the patient may appear phenotypically female. One would expect a low testosterone in isolated gonadotrophin deficiency. Kallman's syndrome results in hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. A teratoma is unlikely to cause hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism."
endocrine system,220,"A 41-year-old woman presents with palpitations and weight loss to the endocrine clinic. She has lost over two stone over the last four months and is increasingly anxious. On examination her BMI is 20, her BP is 135/72 mmHg, and her pulse is 90 and regular. She has a fine tremor. A TSH is measured at less than0.05. Which of the following would you expect to find on further questioning or clinical examination?",Constipation,Decreased libido,Dry skin,Menorrhagia,Weight gain,B,"Changes in libido are reported in patients with hyperthyroidism. Often this is described as a decrease in libido which resolves once euthyroid status is attained. Constipation, dry skin, menorrhagia, and weight gain are more commonly described as being associated with hypothyroidism. More rarely patients may gain weight in hyperthyroidism however, when they succeed in eating more food than is required to compensate for their increased basal metabolic rate."
endocrine system,221,"A 42-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of weight loss of 3 kg over the course of the past six weeks, heat intolerance, and palpitations. She is referred by her GP with abnormal thyroid blood tests; apparently her mother also suffered from an overactive thyroid gland. On examination she has a BMI of 19 kg/m^2, her BP is 142/72 mmHg and her pulse is 95. She has a fine tremor. Her thyroid is diffusely enlarged.

It is usually associated with:  tachycardia increased levels of SHBG, and globally increased uptake on thyroid scan.  Decreased uptake on the scan and one hot area would be a feature of a thyroxine producing thyroid adenoma. Currently this patient has no features consistent with Graves' ophthalmopathy, but these may become apparent later in the course of the disease."
endocrine system,222,Hypermagnesaemia can occur during which of the following clinical situations?,Chronic administration of omeprazole,Chronic kidney disease,Refeeding syndrome,Untreated pre-eclampsia,Untreated renal calculi,B,"Hypermagnesaemia is much less common than hypomagnesaemia and is often iatrogenic in cause. Causes of hypermagnesaemia: Iatrogenic:  treatment with magnesium sulphate to prevent/treat seizures in patients with eclampsia or pre-eclampsia treatment with Mg containing antacids use of citrate-glucuronic acid solutions to dissolve renal calculi either through bladder irrigation or via a nephrostomy tube over-zealous IV treatment of hypomagnesaemia, and chronic use of Mg-containing enemas.  Other causes:  acute or chronic renal failure - release of Mg from tissues, Mg in dialysate, Mg in phosphate binding drugs, and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia.  Interpretation of serum Mg results:  0.7-1.5 mmol/L: reference range 1.5-2.5 mmol/L: mild hypermagnesaemia - symptoms uncommon 2.5-5.0 mmol/L: moderate hypermagnesaemia - symptoms develop including hypotension, prolonged PR and QRS intervals on ECG, arreflexia greater than5.0 mmol/L: severe hypermagnesaemia - at risk of respiratory paralysis through inhibition of acetylcholine release and cardiac arrest.  Treatment: Hypermagnesaemia does not always require treatment, if mild/moderate and iatrogenic; often it is enough to identify and stop the cause. In an emergency, dialysis or administration of IV calcium glucuronate (10 ml of 10%) will reduce the effects of hypermagnesaemia. "
endocrine system,223,What is the leading cause of primary aldosteronism?,Renal artery stenosis,Familial hyperaldosteronism,Bilateral Idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia,Renin producing tumour of juxtaglomerular apparatus,Polycystic kidneys,C,Conn's Syndrome Conn's Syndrome results from primary hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium ions (and subsequently water) in exchange for potassium in the kidney. The result is increased blood volume and therefore increased blood pressure. Hypokalaemia may be present but is often within normal range.The main causes of primary hyperaldosteronism are adrenal hyperplasia (65%) and adrenal adenoma (30-35%). Note some texts refer to primary aldosteronism as Conn's. Strictly speaking Conn's is primary aldosteronism due to adrenal adenomaSecondary hyperaldosteronism is due to increased renin production in conditions such as renal artery stenosis or a renin producing tumour.

On examination she has a bitemporal hemianopia.  Her prolactin levels are over 2000mg/L.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,PCOS,Macroprolactinoma,Microprolactinoma,Diabetes,Acromegaly,B,High prolactin levels lead to amenorrhoea and loss of sexual characteristics.  Macroprolactinoma is most likely as there is a mass effect as evidenced by the bitemporal hemianopia and also the level of prolactin.
endocrine system,225,Which of these should not be utilised in the management of a thyrotoxic storm?,Chlorpromazine,Lugols Solution  followed by carbimazole or propylthiouracil,Carbimazole or Propylthiouracil followed by Lugols solution,Corticosteroids,Beta blockers,B,"A thyrotoxic storm is associated with a high mortality (30% to 50%) and is best managed in ITU.   It can be triggered by many precipitants including infection, post thyroid surgery and withdrawal of antithyroid drugs.  It presents with hyperpyrexia, tachycardia, hypotension, cardiac failure, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and agitation.  Precipitating causes should be treated.  IV fluid resuscitation.  Carbimazole or propylthiouracil should be given followed by Lugols solution (iodine solution).  Lugols must be given following carbimazole or propylthiouracil.  Beta blockers should be utilised unless there is asthma.  IV hydrocortisone blocks T4 conversion to T3.  Chlorpromazine is used for severe agitation.  Rarely haemodialysis and plasmapheresis should be utilised."

endocrine system,227,A 26-year-old woman presents with episodes of dizziness mainly on standing. Her biochemical profile shows hyperkalaemic acidosis. Which underlying condition is she most likely to have?,Addison's disease,Bulimia nervosa,Conn's syndrome,Cushing's syndrome,Type 1 renal tubular acidosis,A,"Her symptoms are suggestive of postural hypotension, which together with hyperkalaemic (and hyponatraemia) acidosis would strongly indicate the presence of Addison's disease. Cushing's and Conn's syndromes are associated with hypertension and hypokalaemia. Hypokalaemia is the most frequent complication of bulimia which may cause cardiac arrhythmias, fits and paraesthesia. Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is due to inability of the renal tubules to maintain acid-base balance, causing a hyperchloraemia and a normal anion-gap. In type 1 (distal) RTA, there is hypokalaemic acidosis with low urinary ammonium production. Patients present with hyperventilation/acidosis and muscular weakness from hypokalaemia. In type 4 RTA (hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism), there is hyperkalaemic acidosis caused by chronic renal insufficiency from diabetes or tubulointerstitial disease."
endocrine system,228,Which hormone stimulates androgen production by action upon theca interna cells?,Luteinising hormone (LH),Inhibin,Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH),Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),Relaxin,A,"Luteinising hormone (LH) LH interacts with theca interna cells, which results in androgen production. Androgens then diffuse through to granulosa cells, where FSH stimulates aromatase synthesis, which catalyses formation of oestrogens.FSH stimulates ovum and follicle development.Inhibin inhibits FSH secretion through pituitary feedback. Oestrogens (and, to a smaller extent, androgens) give negative feedback for LH."

ADH excess leads to reduced water excretion but excretion of sodium ions stays roughly the same. This leads to increased urinary sodium concentration and decreased sodium levels on Uandamp;E measurement. Free water excretion is not elevated or normal in conditions of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) excess, therefore these answer options are incorrect. Although 24 hour excretion rates of sodium are generally unchanged, as the urine volume is low with retention of free water, urine concentrations of sodium will appear inappropriately high."

endocrine system,234,A 18-year-old girl presents with anxiety and palpitations. Her mother had been treated for an overactive thyroid gland having received radioiodine and was now on thyroxine replacement therapy. On examination she had a pulse of 104 bpm with a fine tremor and lid lag. There was no goitre palpable. Investigations revealed:    Serum free T4 33 pmol/L (10-22)   Plasma thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) less than0.05 (0.4-5)   Serum antithyroid peroxidase (anti TPO) titre 40 U/L (less than50)    Which of the following is the most likely cause of her symptoms?,Factitious thyrotoxicosis,Familial hyperthyroglobulinaemia,Graves' disease,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Riedel's thyroiditis,C,"Although the lead-in might make you think that this patient could gain access to thyroxine and so a diagnosis of factitious hyperthyroidism is possible, in practice this is extremely unlikely. Factitious hyperthyroidism is rare and it is important to exclude other causes before jumping to this conclusion. You can measure the serum thyroglobulin, which is low in facticious hyperthyroidism. A strong family history of thyrotoxicosis is typical for Graves' disease; only 85% of patients with Graves' disease have positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies, and therefore their absence does not preclude the diagnosis. The absence of a goitre is also compatible with a diagnosis of Graves' (in addition, a goitre may not be detectable clinically, and may only be seen on imaging). Familial hyperthyroglobulinaemia is extremely rare and the bloods do not suggest that. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune condition leading to hypothyroidism. Riedel's thyroiditis is a chronic condition associated with inflammation and fibrosis."

endocrine system,236,"A 16-year-old male presents with a day history of malaise, weakness, and vomiting. He was diagnosed with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus three years previously. Which one of the following supports a diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?",A random serum glucose 10 mmol/L (4.5-6.4),A serum standard bicarbonate of 10 mmol/L (22-26),Abdominal pain at onset,Decreased appetite in the past few days,Shallow respirations,B,"Abdominal pain at onset is an unusual but recognised feature, particularly in children. However it does not support a diagnosis of DKA. 'Normoglycaemic DKA' can occur and a glucose of 14 is compatible with a diagnosis, but is not suggestive as one might expect to find these sort of concentrations with diabetes per se. The low plasma bicarbonate is highly suggestive of a metabolic acidosis. Usually patients are unwell with infections and anorexia. Fasting is itself associated with the presence of ketones in the urine but not necessarily ketoacidosis. Respiratory compensation leads to rapid deep (Kussmaul's) breathing.    "

They want to know about the aetiology of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and the chances of any offspring inheriting the disease. Which of the following accurately represents one aspect of the pathogenesis of T1DM?,50% of patients developing the disease have a positive family history,All patients are ZnT8 autoantibody positive,Enteroviruses may play a role in protection from and susceptibility to T1DM,The disease is primarily mediated by pathogenic B cells,There is 100% twin concordance,C,"Accumulating evidence suggests that enteroviruses may play a role in both protection from and susceptibility to type 1 diabetes. A large cohort study has demonstrated that decline in C peptide in at risk individuals is associated with positive markers for enterovirus infection, and it is quite plausible that autoimmune attack on beta cells stems from an abnormal response to local viral infection. Type 1 diabetes is a primarily T cell mediated disorder. Whilst autoantibodies to beta cell antigens are measurable in patients with the disease, they are not thought to play direct role in its pathogenesis. ZnT8 is found within the beta cell; whilst ZnT8 autoantibodies are often positive in patients with type 1 diabetes, it is not invariable. Conventionally, anti-GAD and anti-IA2 antibodies are measured to support the diagnosis. Only 10% of patients have a positive family history, and there is 30-50% twin concordance."

There is skin thickening/oedema with overlying increased pigmentation affecting both shins, and mild proptosis on eye examination. Which of the following is the most likely cause of the skin changes over her shins?",Lichen planus,Necrobiosis lipoidica,Pre-tibial myxoedema,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Systemic sclerosis,C,"The answer is pre-tibial myxoedema. This patient's symptoms are consistent with Grave's disease, which is associated with pre-tibial myxoedema. It is thought to occur because of accumulation of glycosaminoglycans secreted by fibroblasts under cytokine stimulation. Normal fibroblasts have been shown to express TSH receptor protein, which may account for why the changes are seen in Grave's disease. Pyoderma gangrenosum manifests as ulcerated lesions, and is seen most commonly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Necrobiosis lipoidica begins as an erythematous lesion on the shin, although this later progresses to necrosis and eventually atrophy, and is classically seen on the shins of insulin-dependent diabetics. Systemic sclerosis results in calcification and thickened skin classically affecting the hands and face. Lichen planus manifests as multiple pruritic purple/violaceous plaques which can affect the skin and mucosal membranes, the cause of which is not fully understood."

The rarer male salt‐losers have the highest risk of death.The commonest cause of ambiguous genitalia at birth is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), of which 95% are deficient in 21‐hydroxylase.Less common enzyme defects involve 11β‐hydroxylase, and 3β‐hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. About two‐thirds of 21‐hydroxylase are salt losers, and present with an hypoadrenal crisis.There are normal male genitalia in 47 XXY (Klinefelter's) and XO (Turner's) XO. In intersex states, the assignation of sex is not totally based on the karyotype."
endocrine system,245,A 17-year-old female presented with a one year history of secondary amenorrhoea. She had been prescribed temazepam and dihydrocodeine previously. On examination she had galactorrhoea to expression. Her prolactin concentration was 6000 mU/L (50-450). Pregnancy test was negative. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia,Non-functioning pituitary tumour,Pituitary microadenoma,Polycystic ovarian syndrome,Turner's syndrome,C,"This patient presents with the classical signs of hyperprolactinaemia, confirmed with the finding of elevated serum levels of prolactin. There are a number of different causes of hyperprolactinaemia, and it is useful to classify them as below: 1. Hypothalamic stimulation:  Primary hypothyroidism Adrenal insufficiency.  2. Medications (inhibit dopamine release, leading to reduced inhibition and therefore higher prolactin release):  Neuroleptics - phenothiazines, haloperidol Antihypertensives - calcium-channel blockers, methyldopa Psychotropic agents - tricyclic antidepressants Anti-ulcer agents - Hs antagonists Opiates and opiate antagonists.  3. Neurogenic (via autonomic nervous system):  Chest wall injury Breast stimulation Breast feeding.  4. Physiological causes (via oestrogen stimulation):  Pregnancy Coitus Exercise Sleep Stress.  5. Increased prolactin production:  Ovarian: polycystic ovarian syndrome Pituitary tumours - adenomas, hypothalamic stalk interruption, hypophysitis  6. Reduced prolactin elimination:  Renal failure Hepatic insufficiency.  The grossly elevated prolactin concentration in this scenario is most suggestive of a microprolactinoma. This is not polycystic ovarian syndrome as the hyperprolactinaemia is far too high. The drugs that she is taking would not cause this level of hyperprolactinaemia. If she were to have a non-functioning pituitary tumour, stalk compression would be expected to produce a prolactin concentration of less than 2000 mU/L. Prolactin levels can be raised in Turner's syndrome, but you would expect some of the other classical features of the condition to be present. "

It is not usually necessary to increase the dose in times of acute illness, unlike hydrocortisone. Replacement of hydrocortisone is skewed so that ⅔ of the dose is given in the morning with ⅓ given in the evening. This reflects physiological release or glucocorticoids. Autoimmune adrenal failure is the most likely cause of hypoadrenalisim in the UK, and 70% of patients have circulating anti-adrenal antibodies. The presence of increased skin pigmentation indicates there are high levels of ACTH (which results in high levels of MSH due to a shared pregenitor molecule, and subsequent skin pigmentation) which shows that there is primary adrenal failure rather than a secondary (pituitary) cause. Other autoimmune conditions such as pernicious anaemia and thyroid disease occur more commonly in association with Addison's."

endocrine system,254,"A 30-year-old woman is known to have a pituitary microadenoma for which she takes long term dopamine agonist therapy. Since being established on therapy her mild symptoms have subsided. At her last clinic follow up she is well, has no symptoms of milk leakage, and her libido and sex life have returned to normal. She wishes to start a family with her partner. Which of the following is the correct advice for her?",She should continue her bromocriptine throughout the pregnancy,She should not start a family until post surgical removal,She should stop her bromocriptine once she knows she is pregnant,She should stop her bromocriptine prior to trying to get pregnant,She should switch the bromocriptine to cabergoline prior to getting pregnant,C,"There is no evidence that bromocriptine is teratogenic from available data on use in pregnancy, but of course, all data come from case series and not from randomised controlled trials. There are less data on cabergoline and so this is not recommended. Once pregnancy is established, bromocriptine is not necessarily required, and so most physicians recommend stopping it for the duration. Many women with a microprolactinoma can be maintained on dopamine agonists without the need to progress to surgery which itself carries associated morbidity. As such, there is no need to stop therapy or progress to surgery before trying for a child, indeed stopping therapy will reduce the chance of ovulation. There is no evidence that bromocriptine is required to be continued throughout the pregnancy.

endocrine system,255,Which test is used to confirm the diagnosis of Gaucher disease?,Abdominal ultrasound,Alkaline phosphatase,Bone marrow biopsy with Gaucher's cells identified,Clinical examination,Enzyme studies of blood leucocytes,E,"Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder characterised by complete or incomplete deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase, required for the metabolism of sphingolipid. Sphingolipids are normally found throughout the body but are particularly important in the grey matter of the brain and in myelin sheaths. Gaucher's disease results in accumulation of glycosphingolipids in liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The defective gene is located on chromosome 21 and around 200 mutations have been described. There is therefore a high degree of phenotypic variation. Certain mutations result in complete deficiency of the enzyme, and present in infancy with severe clinical effects (typically types 2 and 3). Partial deficiency of the enzyme results in a later presentation and more moderate clinical effects. Type 1 patients typically have 10-15% of enzyme activity and present in adulthood.  Type 1 disease: often presents in adulthood with organomegaly, haematological abnormalities such as anaemia, bleeding risk, abdominal pain, and skeletal abnormalities. Type 2 disease: frequently progressively fatal in infancy. Prominent neurological features are present including ophthalmoplegia, spasticity, and CNS degeneration. Type 3 disease: milder course with CNS involvement.  Diagnosis is through enzyme studies on whole blood leucocytes. Clinical examination and abdominal ultrasound may suggest the diagnosis but cannot provide biochemical confirmation. Bone marrow biopsy is not required in all patients but shows characteristic glycosphingolipid-containing macrophages called Gaucher's cells. Acid phosphatase, chitotriosidase, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β and soluble CD163 can be used for surveillance of the disease. "

Investigations revealed:    Serum sodium 144 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 2.4 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum bicarbonate 30 mmol/L (20-28)    Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bartter's syndrome,Coarctation of the aorta,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Conn's syndrome,Inhaled salbutamol therapy,D,This is a tough question as a number of answers are possible. This young asthmatic has a hypokalaemic hypertension and it is assumed that his hypertension is sustained. This would therefore suggest a secondary cause which may be either hyperaldosteronism or pseudohyperaldosteronism. A rare CAH (11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase [11-BHSD] deficiency) may be responsible for hypokalaemic hypertension and the presentation is variable ranging from birth to adulthood but typically birth. Bartter's syndrome is not associated with hypertension. Conn's syndrome is usually found in middle aged patients and would be unusual in a patient of this age but even so is probably the best answer here. Liquorice ingestion could fit this picture but would again be somewhat unusual in this patient. Salbutamol may cause hypokalaemia particularly when given via nebuliser or particularly intravenously but should not produce hypertension.

endocrine system,260,You take some pre-op bloods on a patient with Addison's. Which of the following abnormalities is mediated primarily by glucocorticoid deficiency?,Hypogylcaemia,Hyponatraemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypercalcaemia,Metabolic acidosis,A,Remember in Addison's both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones are deficient. The main mineralocorticoid is Aldosterone. Aldosterone should drive the Na/K pump in the kidney and result in sodium and water retention with potassium being excreted. In aldosterone deficiency potassium rises (hyperkalaemia) as it isn't adequately secreted whilst sodium and water are not reabsorbed (leading to volume depletion & hyponatraemia). Aldosterone should also drive H+ secretion in exchange for potassium. In deficiency H+ accumulates leading to acidosis. Volume depletion is thought to be the main cause of hypercalcaemia.Cortisol (hydrocortisone) is the main glucocorticoid. It stimulates gluconeogenesis. Deficiency can therefore result in hypoglycaemia. Addison's & Adrenal Insufficiency Addison's BasicsAddison's disease or chronic adrenal insufficiency is a rare endocrine disorder where the adrenals produce insufficient steroid hormones. The term Addison's refers to primary adrenal insufficiency i.e. the adrenals themselves are the source of low steroid hormone production. There are several causes of this autoimmune adrenalitis being the most common.Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency refer to insufficient adrenal hormone production due to a cause external to the kidney i.e:Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient ACTH production by the pituitary Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient CRH production by the hypothalamusSigns & SymptomsHypotension Hyperpigmentation (this is due to increased ATCH production) Myalgia Arthralgia Weight loss Anxiety/personality change Coma in Addisons crisisBiochemical featuresHypercalcemia Hypoglycemia Hyponatremia Hyperkalemia Eosinophilia and lymphocytosis Metabolic acidosis

If the HbA1c remains above 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) then metformin therapy should be initiated. A sulphonylurea can be considered if the patient is not overweight, metformin is contraindicated or not tolerated, or a rapid therapeutic response is required because of hyperglycaemic symptoms. If the HbA1c remains above 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) with monotherapy then the combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea should be given. A DPP-4 inhibitor or a thiazolidinedione can be used instead of a sulphonylurea if there is a significant risk of hypoglycaemia or a sulphonylurea is contraindicated or not tolerated. If the HbA1c remains above 58 mmol/mol (7.5%) despite treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea, NICE recommends addition of insulin. However, they state you can consider using sitagliptin or a thiazolidinedione instead of insulin if there would be employment, social, recreational or personal issues. Exenatide can be used if the BMI is more than 35 and there are problems with weight gain, or insulin is unacceptable because of occupational implications. According to these guidelines, the most appropriate choice in this case would be pioglitazone. Although the DVLA rules have currently changed, it is still more difficult for heavy goods drivers to be on insulin as they are required to fulfil a strict set of criteria and provide a great deal of evidence. Acarbose does not feature in current NICE guidelines. "

The underlying cause may be an over-production or under-excretion of uric acid. Monosodium urate monohydrate crystals are deposited within the synovium which becomes inflamed. Crystals may be deposited within joints, tendons or bursae. Deposits over the achilles tendon, elbow, pinnae and fingers are known as tophi and may ulcerate or destroy bone and cartilage. The serum uric acid is elevated above 420 µmol/L and typical birefringent crystals are present in the synovial fluid or on biopsy of a tophus (demonstration of rhomboid crystals with weak birefringence is characteristic of pseudogout). Gout is treated by rest and large doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (such as indomethacin). Colchicine is now rarely used because of its side effects. Surgical washout of the joint is not usually required.

Production of which of the following hormones would be selectively inhibited?,Androstenedione ,Dihydroepiandrostenedione sulphate (DHEAS) ,Dihydrotestosterone (DHT) ,IGF-1 ,Testosterone ,C,Finasteride is a 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor and inhibits the conversion of testosterone to the active DHT. Dihydroepiandrostenedione sulphate (DHEAS) is a mlae sex hormone produced by the adrenals. IGF-1 is produced in response to growth hormone release. Androstenedione is a weak steroid hormone with minimal effects on the body. Testosterone is the primary sex hormone of males.
endocrine system,272,"If a patient with a microprolactinoma who is being treated with bromocriptine is planning to become pregnant, what advice should be given?",Must stop bromocriptine once pregnant and have regular visual field testing and MRIs,Continue bromocriptine at same dose throughout pregnancy,Must stop bromocriptine once pregnant,Continue bromocriptine at reduced dose throughout pregnancy,Continue bromocriptine at increased dose throughout pregnancy,C,"Bromocriptine must be stopped when the patient becomes pregnant, as although it has not been shown to lead to congenital abnormalities it interferes with normal prolactin secretion.  Regular MRIs and visual field testing are not required unless a patient becomes symptomatic."
endocrine system,273,Which of the following is the thyroid hormone receptor?,A cell surface receptor,A cytoplasmic protein,A G-protein coupled receptor,A gated ion channel,A nuclear receptor,E,The thyroid hormone receptor is a nuclear receptor. When it binds tri-iodothyronine (T3) it is able to bind to the thyroid hormone response element (TRE) in the promoter region of thyroid hormone responsive genes and initiates transcription.
endocrine system,274,"In the thyroid gland, each molecule of thyroglobulin contains",5-6 molecules of tetra-iodothyronine (T4),5-6 molecules of T4 and no T3,10-20 molecules of tri-iodothyronine (T3),One molecule of T3 and one molecule of T4,Three molecules of T3 and 4 molecules of T4,A,"5-6 molecules of tetra-iodothyronine (T4)Thyroxine• Storage in thyroid colloid -each thyroglobulin molecule contains ~5-6 T4 molecules andone T3 molecule• Uptake of thyroglobulin by endocytosis, proteolytic cleavage and release of T3 and T4• The thyroid gland produces tetra-iodothyronine (T4) predominantly.

endocrine system,276,"A 69-year-old patient is admitted for routine hernia surgery. Pre-operatively, his serum sodium concentration is 122 mmol/L. The surgical team have asked for medical advice regarding the cause of his hyponatraemia. You have assessed him and believe he has diuretic-induced hyponatraemia and dehydration. According to guidelines, which fluid should be used to resuscitate him?",0.45% Saline,0.9% Saline,5% Dextrose,Gelofusine,Hartmann's solution,E,"Fluid resuscitation is an important and often poorly understood skill. The recent multi-disciplinary GIFTASUP guidelines were endorsed by professional organisations representing surgeons, anaesthetists, biochemists, and physicians, including nephrologists. The guidelines state:  andquot;Saline depletion, for example due to excessive diuretic exposure, is best managed with a balanced electrolyte solution such as Hartmann's.andquot;  In other clinical situations:  Losses from diarrhoea/ileostomy/small bowel fistula/ileus/obstruction should be replaced volume for volume with Hartmann's or Ringer's lactate/acetate type solutions. Excessive losses from gastric aspiration/vomiting should be treated pre-operatively with an appropriate crystalloid solution which includes an appropriate potassium supplement. Hypochloraemia is an indication for the use of 0.9% saline, with appropriate additions of potassium and care not to produce sodium overload.  "

What other investigation should be done?,Testosterone,LSH,FSH,Estradiol,Karyotyping,E,The likely diagnosis is Klinefelter’s syndrome for which Karyotyping should be done to make the diagnosis established
endocrine system,278,A 29-year-old female presents with headaches. She is noted to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg and initial investigations reveal a hypokalaemia of 2.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9). On closer questioning she is found to consume a large quantity of liquorice. Inhibition of which enzyme is responsible for the pseudohyperaldosteronism associated with liquorice?,5 alpha-reductase,11 beta hydroxylase (11 bOH),11 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 bHSD),17 alpha hydroxylase (17aOH),21 Hydroxylase,C,"11bHSD is responsible for the conversion of cortisol to the inactive cortisone, preventing activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor by cortisol but permitting activation by aldosterone. Both liquorice and carbenoxolone inhibit 11bHSD and produce pseudohyperaldosteronism with hypertension and hypokalaemia yet appropriately low renin and aldosterone concentrations. Much research is focused upon this enzyme of late."
endocrine system,279,"A 31-year-old man presents to the clinic with decreased libido and problems maintaining his erection. At first, he consulted his GP and was told that his problems were most likely to be psychological. Clinical examination is unremarkable with a BP of 122/80 mmHg and a pulse of 65 and regular. His prolactin level is elevated at 2900 mU/l. Which of the following is the most likely cause?",Drug induced hyperprolactinaemia,Hypothyroidism,Incidental finding,Macroprolactinoma,Microprolactinoma,E,"Levels of prolactin between around 1000 and 3000 mU/l are consistent with a microprolactinoma. Levels lower than 1000 would be more consistent with exposure to drugs known to increase prolactin, or greater than 3000 would raise suspicion of a macroprolactinoma. Drug induced hyperprolactinaemia tends to be associated with levels less than 1000, as does hypothyroidism. Given his symptoms and the degree of elevation, the prolactin level could not be considered incidental. Macroprolactinomas tend to be associated with prolactin levels above 3000."
endocrine system,280,Which of the following indicates premature ovarian failure?,Elevated FSH/LH ratio,Elevated LH and low oestrogen levels,Elevated FSH and LH levels and low oestrogen,High prolactin,Elevated LH,C,Premature ovarian failure is poorly understood but may be an autoimmune condition.  It leads to elevated FSH and LH and low oestrogen levels.

endocrine system,283,A 44-year-old patient has sudden onset of breathlessness and stridor few minutes after extubation for thyroidectomy. The patient had longstanding goiter for which he had the surgery. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Thyroid storm,Hematoma,Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve injury,External laryngeal nerve injury,Tracheomalacia,E,"Tracheomalacia is a process characterized by flaccidity of the supporting tracheal cartilage, widening of the posterior membranous wall, and reduced anterior-posterior airway caliber. These factors cause tracheal collapse, especially during times of increased airflow, such as coughing, crying, or feeding.Prolonged pressure over trachea by goiter is a cause of tracheomalacia and symptoms become evident following thryroidectomy"
endocrine system,284,"A 52-year-old female presents with tiredness. There are no specific abnormalities noted on examination, but investigations reveal:    T4 21.1 pmol/L (10-22)   T3 5.2 pmol/L (5-10)   TSH 0.05 mU/L (0.4-5)    Thyroid autoantibody titres are all undetectable.

endocrine system,285,A 51-year-old man is found to have bilateral breast enlargement. He says that this is normal for him and that he has not noted any change in years. He shaves infrequently and has scant pubic hair. Which of the following is most likely to be present?,"47, XXY karyotype",History of antidepressant drug therapy,Increased risk for testicular carcinoma,Increased testosterone levels,Seminoma of the testis,A,"Gynaecomastia is common with Klinefelter's syndrome. This is due to men carrying an additional X chromosome. Additional features are a lack of other secondary sexual characteristics and mild deficits in executive function. Male breast cancer is rare and is more often associated with advanced age though there is a small increased risk with Kleinfelter's. There is an association between gynaecomastia and some functioning testicular tumours such as Leydig cell tumours (or rarely, Sertoli cell tumours). Gynaecomastia is related to conditions of high oestrogens, and one of the most common causes for this is cirrhosis of the liver in chronic alcoholics."
endocrine system,286,"A 45-year-old lady complains of expressible galactorrhea, decreased libido and amenorrhea, weight gain and easy fatigue. Her serum prolactin levels are 1100um/l. what is the likely cause of hyperprolactinemia?",Hypothyroidism,Stress,Pregnancy,Prolactin secreting pituitary tumor,PCOS,A,"It is likely to be hypothyroidism because prolactin level in hypothyroidism may be 30-200ng/ml which means 630-4200 mIU/L. Though weight gain can occur but fatigue is not a feature of prolactinoma unless it is a macroadenoma causing suppression of other pituitary hormone! given prolactin level of 1100 IU/L is definitely from a microadenoma (in macroadenoma prolactin level is > 10,000 MU/L) which does not cause fatigue. So the case most likely seems to be hypothyroidism"
endocrine system,287,"A 28-year-old female is referred with a three-month history of tiredness and weakness. On examination, pulse is 82 bpm and blood pressure is 128/72 mmHg. No specific abnormalities are evident on examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal, or neurological systems. Investigations reveal:    Serum sodium 142 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 3.0 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 4.2 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 82 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum chloride 73 mmol/L (95-107)   Plasma glucose 5.5 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Urinary chloride 60 mmol/L (20-350)    Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Bartter syndrome,Conn's syndrome,Drug ingestion,Liddle's syndrome,Non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),C,"This young woman has hypokalaemia and hypochloraemia. The normal blood pressure would exclude a diagnosis of Conn's, CAH, or Liddle's syndrome (apparent mineralocorticoid excess). Similarly, drug ingestion associated with hypokalaemia liquorice/carbenoxolone is again associated with hypertension (and low urinary chloride, less than 20 mmol/L). Bartter syndrome is a rare, recessive condition associated with weakness, lethargy, and growth retardation and is found in youngsters. Hypokalaemic hypochloareamic alkalosis is seen in the condition but symptoms would be more apparent at a much younger age than this woman. If Gitelman's syndrome were offered then that would be a better option. Therefore the most likely diagnosis is diuretic abuse, as the symptoms have arisen only over the last three months and no other features are apparent on examination. "
endocrine system,288,Aromatase is key to Estradiol production in the ovaries. Which of the following statements is true?,FSH induces the theca cells to make aromatase,LH induces the theca cells to make aromatase,LH induces the granulosa cells to make aromatase,FSH induces the granulosa cells to make aromatase,Progesterone induces the granulosa cells to make aromatase,D,It is important to have a good understanding of the two main cell types of the ovaries.The theca cells produce androgen in the form of androstenedione.The theca cells are not able to convert androgen to estradiol themselves. The produced androgen is therefore taken up by granulosa cells. The neighbouring granulosa cells then convert the androgen into estradiol under the enzymatic action of aromatase FSH induces the granulosa cells to produce aromatase for this purposeOvarian Endocrine FunctionFollicular Structure Luteal Structure FunctionsTheca Cells Thecal Lutein Cells(small luteal)Androgen (Androstenedione) production Thecal Lutein cells produce progesteroneGranulosa Cells Granulosal Lutein Cells(large luteal)Convert androgen to estradiol via aromatase Granulosa Lutein cells produce progesteroneRoles of LH and FSHFSH stimulates Aromatase production in the granulosa cells LH stimulates Androgen production in the theca (interna) cells LH also stimulates the contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the theca externa. This increases intrafollicular pressure which results in rupture of the mature oocyte.
endocrine system,289,"A 23-year-old student from central Africa brings her 29-year-old sister who is visiting on holiday to see the GP because she is concerned about a fullness in her neck. There is also a history of fatigue, a dry cough and a change in the quality of her voice over the past few months. She has no other past medical history of note; you ask about her diet, she tells you she eats mainly local food and they cannot get access to fresh fish. On examination her BP is 135/70 mmHg, her pulse is 65 and her BMI is 28. There is a large, diffuse multinodular goitre. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 108 g/L (115 - 165)   White cells 7.5 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelet 179 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Sodium 136 mmol/L (135 - 146)   Potassium 4.6 mmol/L (3.5 - 5)   Creatinine 99 µmol/L (79 - 118)   TSH 6.0 (0.5 - 5.0)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Graves' disease,Hashimoto's disease,Idiopathic hypothyroidism,Iodine deficiency,Non-toxic multinodular goitre,D,"Iodine deficiency and the large goitre, coupled with mild hypothyroidism in a patient from central Africa points you to this as the correct option. Iodine deficiency occurs more commonly in central Africa. It may present in a euthyroid state, or with severe deficiency, symptoms of hypothyroidism. Diffuse goitre becomes nodular over time with prolonged deficiency. Symptoms of extrinsic compression due to goitre size, including shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing may exist. The presentation here with mild hypothyroidism (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] just outside the normal range) is entirely consistent with this picture. Graves' is associated with symptoms of thyrotoxicosis so is incorrect. Hashimoto's would be an alternative consideration here, but the patient's location and relatively indolent course of her disease is designed to point you towards iodine deficiency. Likewise, idiopathic hypothyroidism is incorrect as the location should prompt you to consider iodine deficiency. Non-toxic multinodular goitre is incorrect because of the clues that point you to iodine deficiency. It would be the default correct answer in another situation."
endocrine system,290,"A 25 year old gentleman presents to his GP.   He is concerned as he has small testes and has a low libido and impotent.  He also complains of having breasts despite him being slim and does not need to shave often.  What is the most likely diagnosis?
",Turners Syndrome,Complete androgen insensitivity syndrome,Fragile X syndrome,Klinefelters syndrome,Exogenous oestrogen,D,"The most likely diagnosis is Klinefelters syndrome, where the karyotype is xxy.  This leads to the features noted in the question.  Fragile X syndrome is differentiated as there is large testes and mental retardation.  Testicular feminisation leads to a female phenotype and Turners syndrome is whereby a female has male features due to the karyotype of XO."
endocrine system,291,"A 23-year old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism and coeliac disease comes to the clinic complaining of increased tiredness and lethargy over the course of the past few months. She is generally compliant with her insulin, thyroid medication and coeliac diet. On examination her BP is 115/72 mmHg, pulse is 62 and regular, her BMI is 21. Apart from looking pale, her general physical examination is unremarkable. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 104 g/L (115-160)   MCV 105 fL (80-96)   White cell count 5.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 158 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 µmol/L (79-118)   HbA1c 57 mmol/mol (less than36)   7.4% (less than5.5)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Addison's disease,Pernicious anaemia,Poor compliance with coeliac diet,Poor compliance with thyroid hormone replacement,Thyroid hormone resistance,B,"Given this patient is already suffering from three autoimmune conditions it is quite possible for her to acquire a fourth. The picture of tiredness and lethargy, with a raised mean corpuscular volume (MCV) anaemia against a background of well controlled diabetes fits well with this. Her relatively good HbA1c gives us no reason to suspect poor compliance either with her insulin, coeliac diet, or her thyroid medication. Her electrolytes which are in the normal range make Addison's unlikely. If she were poorly compliant with coeliac diet or thyroid hormone replacement, we would expect poor compliance with diabetes therapies and we have no evidence of that. Thyroid hormone resistance would be associated with weight gain and symptoms of hypothyroidism."
endocrine system,292,An 18-year-old woman presented with a history of 15 kg weight loss in the previous four months. She has been amenorrheic for some months. On examination she had fine lanugo hair and a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg. Which one of the following laboratory results would support the most likely clinical diagnosis?,High plasma follicle stimulating hormone concentration,High serum ferritin concentration,Low plasma cortisol concentration,Low plasma testosterone concentration,Suppressed T3 concentration,E,"The question alludes to a patient with anorexia nervosa. Anorexia is associated with functional hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) levels. Cortisol levels may be increased but are typically within the 'normal range'. They may however, may fail to suppress with dexamethasone. Plasma testosterone levels are normal in females with anorexia. Basal levels of T3 may be depressed in anorexia, though thyroxine (T4) and TSH may be normal. Ferritin levels are low in a state of malnutrition."
endocrine system,293,Which of the following serious complication can occur when hyponatraemia is corrected too rapidly?,Cerebellar dysarthria,Cerebral demyelination,Gait disturbance,Peripheral neuropathy,Postural hypotension,B,"Hyponatraemia, even in mild degrees, is associated with reduced survival and neurological sequelae. Even at serum sodium concentrations of 130-135 mmol/l, patients may be at increased risk of falls, and at increased risk of fracturing. However, it is not clear if the adverse prognosis of hyponatraemia is due to low serum sodium as such, or if this just represents a patient group with more comorbidities or polypharmacy. Hyponatraemia causes:  fatigue muscle weakness gait disturbance falls disorientation cerebral oedema seizures, and death (if untreated).  If hyponatraemia develops gradually (greater than48 hours), the body can use compensatory mechanisms. The risk of cerebral oedema is greater in patients with acute onset (less than48 hours) who are unable to use these compensatory mechanisms. The treatment of hyponatraemia however can also cause problems if it occurs too rapidly. The consequences include cerebral demyelination at pontine and extra-pontine sites. Many authorities recommend that increases in serum sodium of less than12 mmol/24 hours are likely to be safe for the majority of patients. Certain patients with hypokalaemia, liver disease, poor nutritional state or burns are at higher risk of demyelination and should have a rate of sodium correction of less than8 mmol/24 hours."

However in cranial there is a lack of ADH and thus it responds to desmopressin and therefore the urine becomes more concentrated whilst in nephrogenic there is failure of ADH receptors and thus it does not respond to desmopressin."
endocrine system,297,"A 51-year-old man with type 2 diabetes was admitted to the coronary care unit with an acute myocardial infarction (MI) and left ventricular failure. He was commenced on intravenous sliding scale insulin at admission. His other medications comprised gliclazide 160 mg twice daily, aspirin 75 mg OD, ramipril 5 mg daily, isosorbide mononitrate 20 mg BD, furosemide 40 mg OD, and simvastatin 40 mg OD. On stopping his sliding scale insulin, his blood glucose meter readings vary between 15 to 20 mmol/L. He was very obese with a BMI of 38.

The DIGAMI 2 study did not support the use of acutely introduced long-term insulin treatment in type 2 diabetic patients following an MI, but did identify glucose level as a strong independent predictor of long-term mortality. This patient is already on the maximum dose of gliclazide. Given the recent MI and use of furosemide, this is enough evidence of cardiac failure to count against use of pioglitazone. Whilst orlistat may reduce the patient's BMI with time, the reduction in blood sugar that may result will be delayed. Insulin is therefore the most appropriate therapeutic option."
endocrine system,298,Which of the following hormones acts on cartilage and liver to release IGF‐1?,Follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH),Dopamine,Somatostatin,Growth hormone,Thyroid‐stimulating hormone (TSH),D,"Growth hormone acts on the liver to release IGF‐1.IGF‐1 then acts on cells around the body, especially cells in the growth plates of the long bones to grow and divide."

The history of thyroid carcinoma in two first degree relatives raises the possibility of a familial thyroid cancer syndrome. The hypercalcaemia further increases suspicion that this is medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. If there is any suggestion of phaeochromocytoma, and the hypertension raises that possibility here, adequate investigation and possible removal of adenoma before thyroidectomy is crucial. In the event of a phaeochromocytoma, alpha blockade with phenoxybenzamine is the primary strategy for blood pressure control. Excision biopsy is incorrect, because surgery should not be attempted prior to excluding phaeochromocytoma, and thyroidectomy is the treatment of choice. Growth hormone suppression test is incorrect; pituitary adenomas are a feature of multiple endocrine neoplasia-1 (MEN-1). MRI pituitary is incorrect; pituitary adenomas are a feature of MEN-1. Pentagastrin stimulation test is incorrect because there is an obvious thyroid tumour, and this should not delay progression to surgery. This should be used to diagnose less obvious medullary carcinomas of the thyroid, where injecting pentagastrin will result in calcitonin levels significantly above normal range."
endocrine system,300,"A 48-year-old lady with hyperthyroidism was reviewed in the endocrine clinic. She had initially presented to her general practitioner a month ago with flu-like symptoms and tremulousness. Her thyroid function tests at that time were consistent with hyperthyroidism and she was commenced on propranolol. On examination, her pulse was 88 beats per minute and regular. She did not have any eye signs. She had a diffuse, tender goitre. Investigations showed:    Plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone less than0.01 mU/l (0.4-5)   Plasma free T4 66 pmol/l (10-22)    Radioactive iodine (RAI) uptake scan revealed less than 2% uptake within the thyroid gland. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Carbimazole,Lugol's iodine,Prednisolone,Propylthiouracil,Thyroidectomy,C,"This patient is likely to have de Quervain's thyroiditis as suggested by the diffuse tender goitre, hyperthyroidism due to rapid release of preformed thyroid hormones, and very low uptake on RAI uptake scan.

The repeat result is 3.9 mmol/L (2.2-2.6), the previous result four hours earlier was 3.2. The patient has a disseminated malignancy with an unknown primary. Which of the following statements is most correct when considering the hypercalcaemia of malignancy?",A prolonged QT interval is associated with hypercalcaemia,Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoblast function thereby lowering calcium,Calcitonin is of greater benefit than bisphosphonates in the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy,NSAIDs are indicated for bone pain in this patient,"On neurological examination, hyporeflexia may be exhibited",E,"This is an oncological emergency affecting 20-40% of patients with advanced cancer. Hyporeflexia is a common clinical sign in patients with significant hypercalcaemia. Other signs include the classic memonic, andquot;bones, stones, groans, and moansandquot;:  Bones - bone pain, especially if the PTH is elevated Stones - renal calculi Groans - constipation and likely subsequent abdominal pain Pyschic moans - depression and confusion Nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and pancreatitis.  Electrocardiogram changes in hypercalcaemia include bradycardia, prolonged PR interval, short QT interval, widened T waves, and arrhythmias. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption by osteoclasts, and are the first line pharmacological treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy. However, they take 3-4 days to reduce the calcium level, and can result in worsening renal function. It is therefore critical to fully hydrate the patient prior to treatment; in clinical practice we tend to give 3 litres of fluids over a 12-18 hour period prior to giving bisphosphonate. Clearly, this needs to be altered if the patient is at risk of fluid overload and cardiac failure. Calcitonin use is limited by its association with anaphylaxis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should not be prescribed in patients with hypercalcaemia as they reduce renal blood flow thus inhibiting urinary calcium excretion."

endocrine system,304,"A patient who is 16 weeks pregnant and has a BMI of 35, is found to have a fasting glucose of 6.0 mmol/L.  What is the next course of action?",Repeat fasting glucose at 28 weeks,Glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks,Glucose tolerance test,Nil required as diabetes is excluded,Dip urine to ensure no ketones,C,"In a patient with a high BMI and evidence of impaired glucose tolerance as evidenced by a fasting glucose at 6.0 mmol/L then a glucose tolerance test should be performed as the patient is at high risk of gestational diabetes. Although a fasting glucose of >7.0 mmol/L or a random glucose 11.1mmol/L is indicative, if there is evidence of impaired glucose tolerance and other risk factors fasting glucose levels of lower than this should not exclude the diagnosis.  A 75g oral glucose tolerance test should be performed  and if >7.8mml/L confirms the diagnosis of impaired glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes."
endocrine system,305,"A 70-year-old female, who is receiving amiodarone for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, presents with tiredness and weight loss. Investigations reveal:    C-reactive protein 6 mg/L (less than10)   Free Thyroxine 38 pmol/L (10-22)   TSH less than0.05 mU/L (0.4-5)    Which is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",Carbimazole,Lithium therapy,Prednisolone,Radioiodine therapy,Thyroidectomy,C,"Two types of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism are recognised:  The first occurs in patients with underlying thyroid pathology, such as a nodular goitre or Graves disease. Amiodarone contains a significant amount of iodine, which results in increased thyroid hormone synthesis. The second type is a result of amiodarone causing a subacute thyroiditis with release of preformed thyroid hormones into the circulation. This is a direct toxic effect on the thyroid follicular cells, and occurs in patients without underlying thyroid disease. A thyrotoxic phase, which may last several weeks to months, is usually followed by a hypothyroid phase and then recovery.  Both these types of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism can take a number of years to manifest, for reasons which are not fully understood. The second type is most common in Europe and North America whereas the first type is most often seen in iodine-deficienct areas. You cannot tell exactly whether this is type 1 or 2 amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism just based on the information from the question stem. However, type 2 is far more common unless you are in iodine-deficient areas, therefore this is much more likely to be correct. Differentiating between the two forms of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism has therapeutic implications, but can be difficult especially as there can be a mixture of the both mechanisms. Thyroid function tests alone cannot differentiate. A careful history and examination can determine whether the patient has underlying thyroid disease. The iodine-131 uptake scan is the most useful: uptake is typically normal or high in type 1 but minimal or none in type 2. IL-6 levels are highest in type 2. Mild amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism can resolve spontaneously on stopping amiodarone. However, the majority of cases require treatment. Type 1 is usually treated with a thionamide, but potassium perchlorate and lithium carbonate can be used. Type 2 cases are treated with glucocorticoids, usually prednisolone, which are weaned over two to three months. "
endocrine system,306,"A 55-year-old woman with a history of type 2 diabetes managed with BD mixed insulin comes to the clinic for review. Her BP is within target at 130/70 mmHg, she has recently lost 4 kg and her BMI is now 28. Her most recent HbA1c is measured at 56 mmol/mol (7.3%). The only abnormality of note on blood testing is triglycerides which are elevated at 2.5 mmol/L. Which of the following correctly represents the relative increase in cardiovascular risk associated with the elevated triglycerides in this patient?",10%,30%,70%,90%,120%,B,"The answer is 30%. Cardiovascular risk calculators apply a risk multiplier of 1.3 for triglycerides above 1.7 mmol/L. Hypertriglyceridaemia, usually accompanied by low HDL, is the commonest lipid abnormality seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. This is associated with central adiposity and increased insulin resistance. Whilst statins are effective in reducing LDL cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes, further measures are usually required in controlling hypertriglyceridaemia."
endocrine system,307,"A 28 year old pharmacist is brought to A and E after feeling very anxious and sweaty and appearing confused. Her BM was measured and was 2.8. A formal lab glucose revealed a glucose of 2.5, high insulin level and virtually undetectable Cpeptide. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Factitious insulin induced hypoglycaemia,Anorexia,Liver Disease,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,Insulinoma,A,This patient is a pharmacist and does have access to insulin. The key finding which suggests factitious insulin induced hypoglycaemia is the undetectable levels of Cpeptide. Cpeptide is secreted normally form the pancreas with insulin and would therefore be elevated in insulinoma. If Cpeptide levels are low then this suggests synthetic insulin has been injected as in this case.
endocrine system,308,"A 58-year-old man who has a history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presents to the Emergency department complaining of central chest pain which is going down his left arm. His medication includes ramipril, metformin, atorvastatin and gliclazide. On examination his BP is 129/72 mmHg, and his pulse is 81. He has bibasal crackles on auscultation of his chest.

This patient is high risk given his history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and as such should be loaded with both aspirin and clopidogrel. Further chest pain, or failure of his ECG signs to resolve may drive further intervention including progression to angiography. Offer unfractionated heparin as an alternative to fondaparinux to patients who are likely to undergo coronary angiography within 24 hours of admission. If this patient does not progress to angiogram then screening for ischaemia should be considered prior to discharge."
endocrine system,309,A 42-year-old male with a 15-year history of type 1 diabetes presents with a two month history of deteriorating pain and stiffness of the right shoulder. On examination he has painful limitation of internal rotation and can abduct the right arm to only 90 degrees. Flexion is relatively unimpaired. There is some weakness of movement of that shoulder with slight wasting of shoulder muscles. He has some reduced vibration sensation in both hands. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Adhesive capsulitis,Brachial plexopathy,Calcium pyrophosphate arthropathy,Diabetic arthropathy,Rheumatoid arthritis,A,"This patient has typical features of a frozen shoulder and this is typified by the reduced internal rotation and abduction of the shoulder. Slight wasting due to pain and reduced use of the shoulder muscles is expected. Brachial plexopathy is associated with involvement of the brachial plexus with associated specific dermatomal loss of sensation ( not the peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes as in this case) as well as specific loss of strength (not often the shoulder) such as wrist drop, ulna nerve palsy, etc. The reduced vibration sense in both hands is a slight distractor here, and likely represents the early stages of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

endocrine system,310,"You are asked to see an inpatient aged 81, who on ultrasound has been found to have a 4.5 cm infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). He is extremely anxious and concerned. On examination his aneurysm is non-tender. Which is the most appropriate course of action?",Reassure patient that he does not need surgery until AAA greater than5 cm,Reassure patient that he does not need surgery until AAA greater than5.5 cm,Reassure patient that he does not need surgery until AAA greater than6 cm,Repeat scan in 2 years,Urgent CT scan,B,"A non-tender AAA needs to be operated on once it reaches 5.5 cm. From a starting point of 4.5 cm it will take approximately two years for it to reach 5.5 cm. Repeat ultrasound scanning is required every 6 months to check the progress. If it reaches over 5.0 cm then scanning may be every 3 months. There are no universally agreed surveillance intervals. The NHS AAA screening programme (one scan at age 65 for men only: no further scan if no more than 2.6 cm) scans yearly from 3.0 to 4.4 cm and every 3 months from 4.5 - 5.4 cm. This could be considered too often. The US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) advises: 2.6 - 2.9 cm: 5 years 3.0 - 3.4 cm: 3 years 3.5 - 4.5 cm: 1 year 4.5 - 5.0 cm: 6 months 5.1 - 5.4 cm: 3 months   Once the AAA has reached 5.5 cm then a CT is mandatory to establish the exact size and anatomy. There is no evidence to support screening for women. Although they have a higher rupture rate at a slightly smaller size than men, they have a higher mortality than men from both open and endovascular repair."
endocrine system,311,Which of the following is correct of prolactin (PRL)-secreting pituitary tumours?,Are usually macroadenomas at presentation,Produce homonymous hemianopia with a suprasellar extension,Regress during pregnancy,Suprasellar extension is an indication for immediate surgical intervention,Tend to cause higher prolactin levels than idiopathic hyperprolactinaemia,E,"PRL levels above 1000 mU/L are often due to adenoma. For levels under 1000 mU/L other causes such as compression, hypophysitis, null cell adenoma, etc. should be considered. Larger tumours are usually accompanied by higher blood levels. Most prolactinoma are less than 10 mm (microprolactinoma), and rarely more than 10 mm (macroprolactinoma). The compression of the optic chiasm results typically in a bitemporal hemianopia. MRI is more sensitive to small microadenomas than CT. Generally the normal pituitary enlarges during pregnancy and a small but clinically non-significant enlargement is seen in microprolactinomas. Rarely, tumours enlarge during pregnancy to produce headaches and visual defects. Surgery is rarely now required even for large pituitary tumours, as these can be effectively treated with dopamine agonist therapy with rapid shrinkage, even with tumours that are compressing the optic chiasm."

Which of the following investigation will be most helpful in localizing the cause for Cushing’s syndrome?",Serum cortisol,24h urinary cortisol,Low dose dexamethasone suppression test,High dose dexamethasone suppression test,Overnight dexamethasone suppression test,D,High dose dexamethasone suppression test can identify whether pituitary adenoma or ectopic ACTH producing tumour. Suppression is absent in patients with Cushing syndrome due to ectopic ACTH secretion or adrenal abnormalities. Suppression is present in patients with Cushing disease
endocrine system,313,A 65 year old male with lung cancer is found to have symptomatic hyponatraemia with a sodium of 123mmol/l. Further investigation reveals this is most likely due to SIADH. He is put on fluid restriction however unfortunately after one week his sodium is only 125mmol/l. Which of the following should be considered next for management?,IV saline 1.8%,Demclocycline,Desmopressin,Slow Sodium,IV saline 0.9%,B,Initially in patients with SIADH then fluid restiction of approximately one litre per day should be aimed for.  Democycline can be useful if this fails or if the patient is very symptomatic them slow replacement with IV 0.9% oor much less commonly 1.8% can be utilised although the hyponatraemia must not be corrected too rapidly as it could lead to central pontine myelinosis. IV dextrose should be avoided as it will worsen the hyponatraemia. Desmopressin is utilised for the treatment of diabetes insipidus which can lead to hypernatraemia.
endocrine system,314,A 45-year-old woman presents with a one year history of weight gain and intermittent sweating. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Carcinoid syndrome,Hypothyroidism,Insulinoma,Lymphoma,Phaeochromocytoma,C,"The clinical scenario is classic of insulinoma. Weight gain is the key differentiating feature here; sweating being more commonly shared with the other conditions except hypothyroidism. There is nothing else offered, other than insulinoma, that explains both symptoms in this middle aged woman. As primary ovarian failure is not offered as an answer (and one which would seem the most probable) then the features would otherwise suggest an insulinoma which is more common in females and, unlike carcinoid and lymphoma, is associated with weight gain rather than weight loss. Phaeochromocytoma is associated with bouts of sweating but not weight gain; there is also no mention of other typical features such as palpitations and hypertension."
endocrine system,315,"A 70-year-old man underwent emergency surgery for an acute abdomen. Following surgery, he was noted to have become oliguric.

Therefore in this patient, the calculated value is 20 mmol/L. The normal anion gap is between 8-16 mmol/l. The excessive value here reflects the presence of other acidic anions, and in this case with the metabolic acidosis, the constituents may be lactate, etc."
endocrine system,316,A 24-year-old woman presents to the genetics clinic for pre-conception advice. She has a family history of thyroid hormone dyshormonogenesis and wonders what exactly the disorder is. Which of the following stems best characterises the defect responsible for thyroid hormone dyshormonogenesis?,Defect in iodine organification,Defect in thyroid hormone release,Thyroid hormone releasing hormone receptor mutation,Thyroxine receptor mutation,TSH receptor mutation,A,"The thyroid utilises tyrosine and iodine to manufacture thyroxine and T3. Iodide is taken into the thyroid follicular cells by active transporters and then oxidised to iodine by thyroid peroxidase. Organification occurs when iodine is attached to tyrosine molecules which themselves are attached to thyroglobulin, forming monoiodotyrosine (MIT) and diiodotyrosine (DIT). The coupling of 2 molecules of DIT forms thyroxine. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor mutations occur more commonly in association with other G protein receptor mutations such as those involved in the pathogenesis of pseudohypoparathyroidism. Other abnormalities leading to congenital hypoparathyroidism include abnormal migration or formation of the gland, not the other stems described in the question."
endocrine system,317,A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus is being considered in 32-year-old woman who is 16 weeks pregnant. Her body mass index (BMI) was 22 kg/m^2 (18-25). A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) revealed:    Time Plasma glucose concentration   0 hr 6.0 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   2 hr 12.5 mmol/L (less than11.1)    Which of the following is the most appropriate step in the management of this patient?,Glipizide therapy,Insulin therapy,Low calorie diet and exercise,Metformin therapy,Repeat her oral glucose tolerance test in four weeks ,C,"In England and Wales, 2.5% of pregnancies involve women with diabetes. Approximately 87% of these are due to gestational diabetes, 7.5% type 1 diabetes and 5% type 2 diabetes. There are a number of risks to both mother and fetus, including miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, preterm labour, stillbirth, congenital malformations, macrosomia, birth injury, perinatal mortality, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Risk factors for gestational diabetes are:  BMI greater than30 kg/m^2 previous macrosomic baby (greater than4.5 kg) previous gestational diabetes first-degree relative with diabetes, and ethnic origin (South Asian, Caribbean, Middle Eastern).  Screening with fasting plasma glucose, random blood glucose, glucose challenge tests, and urinalysis is recommended for any women with one of these risk factors. The 2-hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test is used to definitively diagnose gestational diabetes. This is performed at 16-18 weeks in women who have been affected in a previous pregnancy (with home BM monitoring prior to this, and a repeat test at 28 weeks if this is normal) and 24-28 weeks for women with any other risk factor. If it is safely achievable, women with gestational diabetes should aim to keep fasting blood glucose between 3.5-5.9 mmol/L and one hour postprandial blood glucose below 7.8 mmol/L during pregnancy. It is important to note HbA1c should not be routinely used to monitor glycaemic control in the second and third trimesters. Most gestational diabetes will respond to changes in diet and exercise. Only 10-20% of women need oral hypoglycaemia agents or insulin therapy. Women should therefore be given dietary advice, and those with a pre-pregnancy BMI of greater than27 should be advised to restrict calorie intake and exercise for at least 30 minutes daily. Hypoglycaemic therapy should be considered for women in whom diet and exercise fails to maintain blood glucose targets during a period of 1-2 weeks. If there is any evidence of fetal macrosomia, therapy should be initiated immediately. Treatment should be tailored to the individual patient, but in general may include oral hypoglycaemics (metformin and glibenclamide) and insulin. There is insufficient evidence regarding long-acting insulin analogues, and isophane insulin therefore remains the first choice for long-acting insulin during pregnancy. Insulin aspart and lispro are safe rapid-acting analogues. Women with insulin-treated gestational diabetes should be advised of the risk of hypoglycaemia (which they may be unaware of) and provided with a concentrated glucose solution. During labour and birth, capillary blood glucose would be monitored on an hourly basis in patients with diabetes and maintained between 4 and 7 mmol/L. This may require the use of a sliding scale. In this patient, diet and exercise has not yet been trialled, and there is no mention of foetal macrosomia. Metformin can then be started if glycaemic control is not achieved within 1-2 weeks. Waiting another four weeks to instigate therapy exposes both mother and foetus to potential harm. Insulin can be used if glycaemic control is not achieved with metformin. Glipizide is not used in pregnancy. "
endocrine system,318,A 60-year-old female presents with recent-onset dyspnoea and noisy breathing. Her chest x ray showed right deviation of the trachea due to a retrosternal goitre. Which of the following tests is most useful in the assessment of airflow obstruction due to the goitre?,Flow volume curve,Forced expiratory flow volume in one second,Forced vital capacity,Peak expiratory flow rate,Residual volume,A,Inspection of the maximal expiratory and inspiratory flow-volume curve is currently the simplest method to establish the presence of upper airway obstruction associated with a retrosternal goitre. This may be present in up to 40% of patients with retrosternal goitre and generally requires at least 50% obstruction of the airway before symptoms arise.
endocrine system,319,A 16-year-old woman presents to the clinic with primary amenorrhoea. Her only past medical history of note is bilateral inguinal hernias repaired as a baby during a period when she lived abroad. No records are available from that time. On examination she is 1.65 m in height. There is no evidence of acne or secondary sexual hair. Breasts and her external genitalia look normal. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 5.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 278 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 80 µmol/L (79-118)   Testosterone 9.1 nmol/L (less than2.5)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Androgen insensitivity syndrome,Autoimmune ovarian failure,Kallman's syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Turner's syndrome,A,"The testosterone which is in the male range, the history of hernias as a baby and absence of acne or secondary sexual hair are all pointers towards androgen insensitivity syndrome. The woman will in fact have a male XY karyotype although with breast development and normal external genitalia will appear female. Cryptorchidism goes hand in hand with the condition, and often it is the testes which herniated through the abdominal wall. Given the complete absence of menarche, autoimmune ovarian failure is extremely unlikely as it is usually a cause of secondary amenorrhoea. Additionally, the absence of secondary sexual hair counts against this diagnosis. Klinefelter's is associated with a male phenotype. Kallman's is associated with loss of sense of smell and failure of secondary sexual development, including breast growth. Turner's, XO karyotype is associated with a number of other features such as short stature, webbing of the skin around the neck, hypertension, and abnormalities of the aorta."
endocrine system,320,Which of the following is caused by acute adrenal insufficiency?,Alkalosis,Hyperglycaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia,Hypotension,E,"Patients with acute adrenocortical insufficiency (Addisonian crisis) may present with:  weakness nausea and vomiting abdominal pain hypotension, and fever.  Biochemical findings associated with adrenocortical insufficiency include:  hyponatraemia hyperkalaemia acidosis, and hypoglycaemia."
endocrine system,321,A 75-year-old man is admitted with a blood sugar of 40 mmol/L and lobar pneumonia and dies despite treatment. Post-mortem examination reports the presence of amyloid polypeptide on pancreatic histology. What would this would suggest?,That he had chronic pancreatitis as a cause of diabetes,That he had diabetes secondary to amyloidosis,That he had type 1 diabetes,That he had type 2 diabetes,This can be a non-specific finding,D,"The presence of amyloid polypeptide on pancreatic histology is highly suggestive of type 2 diabetes. Although the primary defect in type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, loss of insulin secretory function over time does occur in patients with type 2 diabetes, and reduction in beta cell mass due to amyloid deposition may partly account for this."
endocrine system,322,"Whilst reviewing a 34 year old patient with amenorrhoea in clinic they tell you they have gained over 10kg in weight in the past 8 weeks and have noticed worsening acne. Routine bloods taken that morning show a random glucose 11.1mmol/l, normal thyroid function tests and negative pregnancy test. BP is 168/96 mmHg.",Hyperthyroidism,Addisons disease,Addisonian crisis,Flammer syndrome,Cushing's syndrome,E,"Of the diagnoses listed Cushing's fits the bill best. A number of endocrine problems can cause weight gain and hypertension such as Conn's and hyperparathyroidism. Central obesity and moon face are key external features in Cushings. History of acne, depression, irritability, amenorrhoea and myopathy may come up in the exam. Tests may show hypertension, diabetes and hypercholesterolaemia. Hyperthyroidism typically causes weight loss. Flammer and Addisons are associated with hypotension. Cushing's Cushing's syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms due to raised levels of cortisol.Cushing's disease is a cause of Cushing's syndrome where increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary stimulates cortisol production. This is typically the result of a pituitary adenoma."
endocrine system,323,Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is noted in which of the following?,Chronic renal failure (CRF),Constitutional short stature ,Laron's syndrome,Sheehan's syndrome ,Turner's syndrome ,D,"Sheehan's syndrome is post-delivery infarction of the pituitary and growth hormone deficiency is typical. Although GH therapy is used in CRF, Turner's syndrome and short stature subjects are not GH deficient. Laron's syndrome is due to a GH receptor defect with impaired IGF-1 production. It is an autosomal recessive condition, characterised by short stature and reduced incidence of cancer and diabetes. Constitutional short stature and CRF do not lead to GHD."
endocrine system,324,Which of the following statements concerning transferrin is correct?,"In the absence of anaemia, transferrin is 80% saturated with iron",Levels are elevated in haemochromatosis,Levels are elevated in patients on the oral contraceptive pill,Transferrin binds ferrous iron,Transferrin levels fall during pregnancy,C,"Pregnancy and the oral contraceptive pill (OCP) both increase transferrin levels. Iron is carried in the blood bound to transferrin. Fe^2+ (ferrous iron) is oxidised to Fe^3+ (ferric iron) by caeruloplasmin to bind to transferrin which is about one-third saturated with iron. The saturation of transferrin (plasma iron concentration/TIBC x 100) is used as a measure of iron stores. A value below 16% is indicative of iron deficiency. The transferrin level and the TIBC rise in iron deficiency. Pregnancy and the OCP both increase transferrin levels; whereas transferrin and TIBC fall in iron overload, percentage saturation is increased in haemochromatosis."
endocrine system,325,"A 62 year old female presents with lethargy, feeling depressed, intolerant to cold and weight gain and constipation.  On examination she is bradycardic and her hands, feet and face appear puffy.  There is no evidence of a goitre.  She is found to have raised TSH and low free T4.  Her antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are positive.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hypopituitarism,TSH deficiency,Atrophic thyroiditis,Hashimotos thyroiditis,Iodine deficiency,C,"In atrophic thyroiditis, which is an autoimmune disease, there is diffuse lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid gland which leads to atrophy and thus no goitre is felt."
endocrine system,326,A 21-year-old woman is known to suffer from anorexia nervosa. Which of the following metabolic disturbances would be a characteristic finding?,A decrease in cortisol levels,An increase in LH levels,Hyperkalaemia,Impaired glucose tolerance,Raised androgen levels,D,"Patients with anorexia nervosa frequently manifest impaired glucose tolerance. The mechanism of this is not entirely understood, but in its most severe form it can result in diabetes. Cortisol levels are elevated and acquired growth hormone resistance occurs, resulting in raised basal and pulse levels compared to healthy individuals. Luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) would be low and LH response to luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) is impaired when weight loss is severe. This results in low androgen levels. Hypokalaemia (not hyperkalaemia) may be seen. There may also be hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia, leukopaenia, and raised serum carotene."
endocrine system,327,A 17-year-old woman presents with symptoms of severe lethargy and depression. According to her mother she eats minimal amounts and she suspects that her daughter is vomiting to reduce her calorie intake. On examination her BMI is 16.5. She looks emaciated and there are scars on her knuckles consistent with induced vomiting. She has fine hairs covering her arms and legs. Which of the following would you most expect to find on laboratory screening?,Decreased cortisol,Decreased potassium,Decreased TSH,Elevated sodium,Elevated TSH,B,"Decreased potassium would be consistent with both induced vomiting and abuse of diuretics. As such, it is the most likely abnormality to be seen on routine laboratory testing. Cortisol levels if anything are increased, consistent with a stress response. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are not affected by anorexia and elevated sodium would only be expected in circumstances of severe dehydration."
endocrine system,328,A 30-year-old man had a blood pressure of 150/100 mmHg. Clinical examination was normal. Which one of the following would suggest secondary hypertension?,24 hour urinary protein excretion of 1.6 g (less than0.2),A creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min (70-140),Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) criteria on the ECG,Serum potassium of 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9),The presence of arteriovenous (AV) nipping on fundoscopy.,A,"It is rather young for a 30-year-old to be hypertensive but the presence of such a degree of urinary protein would suggest that the lesion is of renal; origin polyarteritis nodosa etc. The potassium concentration is normal and although it does not exclude Conn's it is certainly not suggestive. LVH would be found with sustained hypertension of any aetiology, as would AV nipping. The creatinine clearance is normal."
endocrine system,329,Which of the following is a glycoprotein hormone?,Cortisol,Growth hormone releasing hormone,Oxytocin,Thyrotropin (TSH),Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH),D,Thyrotropin is glycosylated. Cortisol is a steroid hormone. The others are peptide hormones/neuropeptides which as a group are rarely glycosylated.

She has been complying with a healthy diet and her capillary blood glucose monitoring had revealed readings usually between 7.5 to 9 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). Her recent HbA1c measured 51 mmol/mol (20-46). Which is the next most appropriate management step?,Gliclazide therapy,Insulin therapy,Metformin therapy,Pioglitazone therapy,Repeat HbA1c in a fortnight,C,"2.5% of pregnancies in England and Wales involve women with diabetes. Approximately 87% of these are due to gestational diabetes, 7.5% type 1 diabetes and 5% type 2 diabetes. There are a number of risks to both mother and fetus, including miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, preterm labour, stillbirth, congenital malformations, macrosomia, birth injury, perinatal mortality, and neonatal hypoglycaemia. Risk factors for gestational diabetes are BMI greater than30 kg/m^2, previous macrosomic baby (greater than4.5 kg), previous gestational diabetes, first-degree relative with diabetes,and ethnic origin (South Asian, Caribbean, Middle Eastern). Screening with fasting plasma glucose, random blood glucose, glucose challenge tests, and urinalysis is recommended for any women with one of these risk factors. The two hour 75 g oral glucose tolerance test is used to definitively diagnose gestational diabetes. This is performed at 16-18 weeks in women who have been affected in a previous pregnancy (with home BM monitoring prior to this, and a repeat test at 28 weeks if this is normal) and 24-28 weeks for women with any other risk factor. If it is safely achievable, women with gestational diabetes should aim to keep fasting blood glucose between 3.5-5.9 mmol/L and one hour postprandial blood glucose below 7.8 mmol/L during pregnancy. It is important to note HbA1c should not be routinely used to monitor glycaemic control in the second and third trimesters. Most gestational diabetes will respond to changes in diet and exercise. Only 10-20% of women need oral hypoglycaemia agents or insulin therapy. Women should therefore be given dietary advice, and those with a pre-pregnancy BMI of greater than27 should be advised to restrict calorie intake and exercise for at least 30 minutes daily. Hypoglycaemic therapy should be considered for women in whom diet and exercise fails to maintain blood glucose targets during a period of 1-2 weeks. If there is any evidence of fetal macrosomia, therapy should be initiated immediately. Treatment should be tailored to the individual, but in general may include oral hypoglycaemics (metformin and glibenclamide) and insulin. There is insufficient evidence regarding long-acting insulin analogues, and isophane insulin therefore remains the first choice for long-acting insulin during pregnancy. Insulin aspart and lispro are safe rapid-acting analogues. Women with insulin-treated gestational diabetes should be advised of the risk of hypoglycaemia (which they may be unaware of) and provided with a concentrated glucose solution. During labour and birth, capillary blood glucose would be monitored on an hourly basis in patients with diabetes and maintained between 4 and 7 mmol/L. This may require the use of a sliding scale. In this patient, diet has failed to achieve adequate glycaemic control, and it is therefore reasonable to start metformin. None of the other oral hypoglycaemics listed are indicated in pregnancy. Waiting another two weeks to instigate therapy exposes both mother and foetus to potential harm. Insulin can be used if glycaemic control is not achieved with metformin. "
endocrine system,331,"Whilst reviewing a 34 year old patient with amenorrhoea in clinic they tell you they have gained over 10kg in weight in the past 8 weeks and have noticed worsening acne. Routine bloods taken that morning show a random glucose 11.1mmol/l, normal thyroid function tests and negative pregnancy test. BP is 168/96 mmHg. You suspect Cushing's. What would the most appropriate investigation be to conform the diagnosis?",Random serum ACTH,Plasma Corticotrophin Releasing Hormone,Morning urinary cortisol,Dexamethasone suppression test,9am serum cortisol,D,"In Cushing's syndrome there is excess cortisol. Causes are broadly divided into 2 types:ACTH dependent disease: excess ACTH from the pituitary (Cushing's disease), ectopic ACTH-producing tumours or excess ACTH administration. Non-ACTH-dependent: adrenal adenomas, adrenal carcinomas, excess glucocorticoid administration.The recommended diagnostic tests for the presence of Cushing's syndrome are 24-hour urinary free cortisol, 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test and late-night salivary cortisol. There are several other tests that may also be performed to find the cause. ACTH and cortisol measured together may show if this is ACTH dependent or not. MRI pituitary and CT abdo and pelvis may show if tumour is the cause. Cushing's Cushing's syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms due to raised levels of cortisol.Cushing's disease is a cause of Cushing's syndrome where increased secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary stimulates cortisol production. This is typically the result of a pituitary adenoma."

endocrine system,334,With which one of the following diabetic medications is weight loss most associated?,Exenatide,Gliclazide,Pioglitazone,Repaglinide,Sitagliptin,A,"Exenatide is one of the GLP-1 mimetics. GLP-1 is a hormone released by the gut in response to food intake that acts on the pancreatic beta cells to trigger insulin secretion. Therefore, the GLP-1 mimetics stimulate insulin release. The GLP-1 mimetics are associated with weight loss and are a good choice in patients who are significantly overweight. The glitazones and sulphonylureas are all associated with significant weight gain, whilst repaglinide may result in very minimal or no weight gain. DPPIV inhibitors (the gliptins) are thought to be weight neutral."

Which is the most appropriate treatment for the prevention of steroid-induced osteoporosis?,Bisphosphonate therapy,Calcium and vitamin D ,Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),Raloxifene,Calcitonin,A,The most appropriate therapy advocated by the National Osteoporosis Society for the prevention of steroid-induced osteoporosis would be bisphosphonate therapy such as Didronel or alendronate. These are the only class of drug shown to offer osteoprotection with steroid therapy. Patients taking 7.5 mg or more of prednisolone daily for three months or longer should be offered osteoprotection. HRT would not really be appropriate for this subject who is ten years past the menopause and likely to be free of all menopausal symptoms. Calcium and vitamin D can be used in prevention but in this case would not be quick to work. Calcitonin is used in hypercalcaemia.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Anorexia nervosa,Bacterial overgrowth,Beta-thalassaemia minor,Coeliac disease,Crohn's disease,D,"Coeliac disease is the likely option as this patient has autoimmune disease (T1DM), an iron deficiency anaemia, and little in the way of symptoms. Coeliac disease is very variable in its presentation and need not always be associated with a significantly abnormal bowel habit. Although 3-4 loose and pale bowel motions is typical, bowel habit will depend on gluten intake. Stool of normal colour and consistency does not exclude a diagnosis of Coeliac disease. As a diffuse disease process affecting the small bowel, Coeliac disease may cause malabsorption of iron and folate causing, anaemia with either micro- or macrocytosis. Sometimes the MCV may be 'normal' due to a deficiency of both causing a bimodal distribution of red cell volumes which has an average in the normal range. If patients have additional reasons to be deficient in either folate or iron (e.g. menorrhagia in women) then that may dominate the clinical picture. Symptoms of Coeliac disease are often mild and non-specific which is why the diagnosis is missed if there is not a high index of suspicion. If you see a young patient with nutritional deficits (B12, folate, iron) then you should check antibodies. Bacterial overgrowth is associated with profuse diarrhoea and a macrocytosis due to vitamin B12 consumption. Crohn's disease would be expected to be symptomatic."

Diarrhoea may persist for many years before the condition is formally diagnosed and any mass on pancreatic ultrasound is often large at the point of diagnosis. Medical management of choice is with somatostatin analogues, often small doses lead to a cessation of symptoms. Non-metastatic tumours can be surgically resected. Bromocriptine is a dopamine agonist which can be used in the treatment of prolactinoma. Cholestyramine is a bile acid sequestrant that can be used in the management of diarrhoea related to small bowel malabsorption or pancreatitis. Codeine prolongs small bowel transit time and increases stool water absorption, it may be an adjunct in patients who do not adequately respond to somatostatin.

The combination is compatible with a diagnosis of haemochromatosis and measuring ferritin would be a reasonable investigation. Haemochromatosis typically causes hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism as a consequence of the ferritin deposition within the pituitary rather than primary testicular dysfunction. Autonomic nerve dysfunction is one of the commoner causes of impotence in a person with diabetes but in this case is not the cause of his HH. For similar reasons, both nerve conduction studies and Doppler studies are irrelevant. Prolactin would be a sensible measurement, but if you were looking to confirm a diagnosis that incorporates the diabetes as well, ferritin would be the investigation of choice."

endocrine system,361,Which gut hormone promotes the synthesis of intrinsic factor?,Cholecystokinin (CCK),Gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP),Gastrin,Secretin,Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),C,"Intrinsic factor is a glucoprotein secreted from the parietal cells of the stomach in response to gastrin, food or histamine. Many substances can bind vitamin B12 in the gut, but only intrinsic factor can aid its transportation across the mucosal wall. When the vitamin B12 bound to intrinsic factor reaches the terminal ileum, it binds to receptors on the surface of the mucosal cells and is able to cross the membrane and enter the cytoplasm. The intrinsic factor is then replaced by transcobalamin II which transports the B12 out of the cell and into the bloodstream. Gastrin:  Big, little and mini forms of gastrin are made in the G-cells of the gastric antrum and duodenum called G-34, G-17 and G-14 respectively Made from cleavage of a precursor molecule, preprogastrin Multiple fragments exist; with variable degrees of biological activity. The smallest is a tetrapeptide (G-4) but it has reduced biological activity compared with larger molecules Once secreted, it enters the blood stream and travels to the gastric fundus where it stimulates the secretion of gastric acid  Stimulus for secretion:  Antral distention Amino acids partially digested in stomach - especially phenylalanine, glycine and tryptophan (gastric pH 5-7) Caffeine, alcohol, hypoglycaemia, calcium Vagal stimulation due to the smell and taste of food.  Actions:  Production of gastric acid, pepsinogen and intrinsic factor Promotes release of secretin Promotes secretion of bile and pancreatic bicarbonate and enzymes Increases intestinal and gastric motility Promotes mucosal growth Stimulates increased blood flow to stomach."

endocrine system,363,"A 73 year old female suffers a pathological fracture. She has been complaining of constipation, anorexia, thirst and urinary frequency. SHe is found to be hypercalcaemic, hypophosphataemic and a raised PTH. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bony metastases,Pagets disease,Myeloma,Osteomalacia,Primary Hyperparathyroidism,E,The most likely diagnosis is hyperparathyroidism. There is excessive secretion of parathyroid hormone leading to hypercalcaemia and hypophoshataemia. This thus results in the signs and symptoms described. The diagnosis is unlikely to be Pagets or as there is normal phosphate and calcium. Both Metastases and myeloma are associated with a normal or increased phosphate level. Osteomalacia leads to hypocalcaemia.
endocrine system,364,Which of the following concerning diabetic retinopathy is correct?,Improved glycaemic control is more effective than hypertensive control in reducing progression of disease,Is unusual in patients with type 2 diabetes,Normal visual acuity is seen in proliferative retinopathy,Progression is unlikley to be reduced with statin therapy,Soft exudates are a feature of severe proliferative retinopathy,C,Diabetic retinopathy occurs in both type 1 and 2 DM and may be a presenting feature in type 2 as the condition may have existed for many years prior to diagnosis. Progression may be slowed with improved glycaemic and hypertensive control but the latter has been shown to be more effective at reducing progression (UKPDS). Soft exudates are a feature of pre-proliferative not proliferative Rn and despite quite marked new vessel disease the visual acuity may be normal.

He was taking the following medications: atenolol 50 mg once daily,doxazosin 4 mg daily, amlodipine 10 mg daily, and bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily. On examination his pulse was 64 beats per minute, his blood pressure was 162/96 mmHg, heart sounds were normal and there were no cushingoid features. Investigations showed:    Serum urea 4.4 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 88 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum potassium 3.6 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)    Which is the most important medication to be discontinued before testing his aldosterone/plasma renin activity ratio?",All of his medications,Amlodipine,Atenolol,Doxazosin,None of his medications,C,"Screening for hyperaldosteronism should be considered for hypertensive patients with hypokalaemia (not due to treatment), those with marked diuretic-induced hypokalaemia (less than3.0) and those with refractory hypertension (failure to respond to three or more agents). Primary hyperaldosteronism was previously believed to account for less than 1% of hypertension, but recent studies have shown a much higher prevalence (up to 12%) and have demonstrated that most patients are normokalaemic. Primary hyperaldosteronism may therefore be the most common potentially curable cause of hypertension, and as such should always be considered. The renin/aldosterone ratio, together with cortisol, can be used to diagnose primary hyperaldosteronism when you would expect the aldosterone to be high, renin low, and normal cortisol. Patients ingesting large amounts of sodium, those with renal impairment, or those taking beta blockers can have false-positive results. Salt restriction, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers, spironolactone, and other diuretics can lead to false-negative results. Alpha blockers (for example, doxazosin) and calcium channel blockers (for example, amlodipine) are the hypertensives of choice in patients undergoing renin/aldosterone ratio measurements. The effect of drugs on renin and angiotensin is seen below:    Drug Renin Aldosterone Effect   Non-dihydropyridine CCB Minimal Minimal No effect   Dihydropyridine CCB Minimal Decreased/minimal No effect   Alpha-blockers Nil Nil No effect   Hydralazine Minimal Minimal No effect       ACE inhibitors andamp; ARBs Increased Decreased False negative   Diuretics Increased markedly Increased False negative   Minoxidil Increased Minimal False negative       Beta-blockers Decreased Minimal False positive   Methyldopa Decreased Minimal False positive    Aldosterone levels can fall with severe illness, so testing should be done following recovery.

endocrine system,367,"You are looking after a 48-year-old patient with alcohol-related liver disease and varices. She was admitted the previous day with haematemesis and is currently nil-by-mouth awaiting an endoscopy with variceal banding. She weighs 50 kg. Her blood test results are as follows:    Na 122 mmol/L (135-145)   K 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5.2)   Creatinine 82 µmol/L (80-120)    You wish to assess her requirements for IV fluids, while she is nil-by-mouth. Which of the following amounts is her daily potassium requirement?",10 mmol,25 mmol,50 mmol,120 mmol,None,C,"Patients need around 1 mmol/kg per day to maintain body potassium reserves. In general, patients who are nil-by-mouth awaiting procedures or surgery require maintenance doses of sodium and potassium. This is particularly important to prevent hypokalaemia as patients recovering from acute illness are often slow to normalise their potassium concentrations. The multidisciplinary GIFTASUP guidelines regarding IV fluid therapy in adults state: andquot;In the adult, daily maintenance requirements are usually the reference nutrient intake (RNI) 70 mmol sodium, and 1500-2500 ml water. In the absence of kidney disease or hyperkalaemia potassium needs to be provided in amounts close to the RNI for adults (40-80 mmol/day) - bearing in mind that in the unfed, low insulin state potassium may equilibrate more slowly with the intracellular space than when insulin or nutritionally significant amounts of carbohydrate are being administered.andquot; In the patient above, who has alcohol-related liver disease, there may be additional factors which may affect fluid and sodium prescription, such as oedema."

Her urine sodium is appropriately low and due to a relative dehydration, she has appropriately concentrated urine. This is not Addison's disease as urine sodium would be high with high urea and likely high potassium. Similarly it is not SIADH due to the low urine sodium. Diuretic abuse would cause high urine sodium. Water intoxication would produce a dilute urine."

endocrine system,371,"If you suspect a patient has acromegaly, what investigation should be utilised initially to confirm the diagnosis?",IGF1 levels,MRI of pituitary,Perimetry,Random growth hormone level,Glucose tolerance test,A,Initially in the diagnosis an IGF1 level should be taken and if this is raised then the diagnostic glucose tolerance test should be arranged. In a glucose tolerance test the patient fail to suppress there growth hormone levels. An MRI of pituitary will be required for the location of the tumour however should not be used for the initial diagnosis.

Investigations reveal:    LH 3.3 mU/L (3-10)   FSH 5.5 mU/L (3-10)   Testosterone 5.5 nmol/L (9-30)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Anorexia nervosa,Craniopharyngioma,Kallmann's syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Primary testicular failure,C,"This young male has delayed puberty with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. The most likely explanation would be Kallmann's syndrome. Klinefelter's would be associated with elevated luteinising hormone/follicle stimulating hormone (LH/FSH), as would primary testicular failure. In Klinefelter's you would also expect testicular dysgenesis. His height of 1.8 m, suggesting that he is tall, would argue against this being anorexia despite his thin appearance. If anorexia had preceded puberty then his stature should also have been affected. The only other possibility is craniopharyngioma, but this is probably less likely in an otherwise well man, and other possible features should be included to suggest this diagnosis."
endocrine system,373,"A 26-year-old man presented with exertional thigh cramps. He described his urine turning to burgundy colour especially after prolonged exertion. Investigations in the recent past had excluded presence of any significant ischaemic or inflammatory condition affecting his lower limbs.

Drug treatment of type 2 diabetes is associated with a linear reduction in mortality related to level of glycaemic lowering. The rate of macrovascular complications within 10 years of diagnosis is much higher than 20%. UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) has shown that metformin is the preferable first line drug therapy in type 2 diabetes.

Which of the following agents is most likely to be responsible?,Ethambutol,Isoniazid,Pyrazinamide,Rifampicin,Streptomycin,D,"It is to be assumed that this patient commenced thyroxine replacement after her TSH of 11.2 was recorded. Certain drugs are recognised to interfere with absorption of thyroxine, these include rifampicin, calcium supplements, amiodarone, and ferrous sulphate. As such rifampicin is likely to have blocked thyroxine absorption in this woman, leading to a hypothyroid crisis. Isoniazid, pyrazinamide, streptomycin, and ethambutol are not known to interfere with thyroxine absorption, and so cannot be the correct options here."

Type 1 renal tubular acidosis is characterised by a failure of the alpha-intercalated cells of the distal tubule to excrete hydrogen ions. This results in an inability to acidify the urine, and subsequently serum acidosis (due to build-up of H^+) and hypokalaemia (as K^+ reabsorption is linked to H^+ excretion). Alkaline urine increases the risk of calcium deposition, and therefore nephrocalcinosis is a feature of type 1 renal tubular acidosis. Subsequent bone demineralisation results in Rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. Type 2 renal tubular acidosis is caused by a failure of proximal tubular cells to resorb bicarbonate from the urine, which also results in serum acidosis. As the distal tubule functions normally, the acidosis is less severe than type 1 RTA, and they urine has a pH of less than 5.3. Rather than being a solitary defect, type 2 renal tubular acidosis is usually associated with a more generalised dysfunction of tubular cells which manifests as Fanconi syndrome (phosphaturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, uricosuria, tubular proteinuria). Phosphate wasting results in marked bone demineralisation. The presence of a urine pH of more than 5.3 here, with symptoms suggestive of a renal tract stone, means that type 1 renal tubular acidosis is the most likely diagnosis. Bartter and Conn's syndromes are causes of hypokalaemia and metabolic alkalosis, which does not fit with the electrolyte values given above."

Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 105 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 7.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 207 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 130 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 5.1 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 122 µmol/L (79-118)   TSH 0.3 IU/L (0.5-4.5)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Addison's disease,Graves' disease,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Postpartum thyroiditis,Sheehan's syndrome,E,"The clues here centre around the postpartum haemorrhage, electrolyte disturbance, and low TSH. The absence of pigmentation in the presence of electrolyte disturbance consistent with adrenal insufficiency also helps point us towards pituitary disease. MRI of the pituitary and pituitary function testing including LH/FSH are indicated. We are given the low thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) as well as electrolyte disturbance, showing that this is panhypopituitarism leading to adrenal insufficiency, rather than Addison's. Graves' is associated with thyrotoxicosis, and we have no evidence of that here apart from the low TSH, which is in fact consistent with pituitary failure rather than elevated thyroxine leading to negative feedback on TSH production. Hashimoto's and postpartum thyroiditis would not be associated with the electrolyte disturbance seen here."
endocrine system,392,A previously well 35-year-old patient presents with anxiety and weight loss. Serum corrected calcium is 2.95 mmol/l. Which of the follopwing is the most likely cause of his hypercalcaemia?,Addison's disease,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Thyrotoxicosis,Vitamin D toxicity,Williams' syndrome,C,"Hypercalcaemia is common and can be caused by:  Primary hyperparathyroidism - overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) due to hyperplasia or an adenoma of the PTH glands. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism - in a patient with chronic renal failure with prolonged hypocalcaemia the parathyroids become autonomous, even if renal function is improved with transplantation. This can lead to hypercalcaemia. Malignancy - commonly myeloma, prostate, breast, lung, thyroid, and kidney cancers. Drugs: lithium, vitamin D overdose, vitamin A toxicity, thiazides. Thyrotoxicosis - most patients with thyrotoxicosis have minor alterations in serum calcium, but a minority have significant symptomatic hypercalcaemia, probably due to increased bone turnover. Treating the thyroid disease causes resolution of the hypercalcaemia. Addison's disease - although it would be uncommon to have significant hypercalcaemia. Granulomatous disease - sarcoidosis, leprosy, TB. Infections - HIV, histoplasmosis. Williams' syndrome - a rare genetic disease affecting chromosome 7 and characterised by hypercalcaemia in infancy, anxiety and learning disability. Milk-alkali syndrome - the triad of hypercalcaemia, metabolic alkalosis and renal impairment secondary to the ingestion of large amounts of calcium and absorbable alkali (such as sodium bicarbonate for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease).  Familial hypercalcaemic hypocalciuria - autosomal dominant mutations in the calcium sensing receptor gene, leading to calcium hyposensitivity, compensatory hypercalcaemia and hypocalciuria.   Note that secondary hyperparathyroidism is a response to hypocalcaemia, not a cause of hypercalcaemia."
endocrine system,393,What is the mechanism of action of meglitinides?,PPARgamma agonist,Stimulates insulin release form a cell by closure of K ATP channel,Reduced peripheral insulin resistance,Weight loss,Stimulates insulin release from beta cells by closure of K ATP channel,E,Meglitinides lead to closure of the beta cell K ATP channel stimulating insulin release. This is similar to sulfonylureas. Glitazones act as PPARgamma agonist and reduced peripheral insulin resistance can also be observed in sulfonylurea and metformin.
endocrine system,394,A 26-year-old man with a past history of parathyroid surgery presented with galactorrhoea. Investigations showed:    Plasma follicle-stimulating hormone 4.2 U/L (1-7)   Plasma luteinising hormone 5.6 U/L (1-10)   Plasma prolactin 1654 mU/L (less than360)   Plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone 3.8 mU/L (0.4-5)   Insulin-like growth factor 1 33.4 nmol/L (7.5-37.3)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,MEN type 1,MEN type 2a,MEN type 2b,Polyglandular syndrome type 1,Polyglandular syndrome type 2,A,"The story of galactorrhoea suggests hyperprolactinaemia and in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism suggests MEN type 1. MEN type 1 is an autosomal dominant condition and is associated with hyperparathyroidism, pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours, and pituitary tumours."
endocrine system,395,A 40-year-old female who has been prescribed thyroid replacement therapy has routine thyroid function tests. On examination she appeared clinically euthyroid with no abnormal findings. Her thyroid function tests revealed:    TSH 3.2 mU/L (0.4-5.0)   Total T4 20 nmol/L (55-144)   Free T4 2.6 pmol/L (10-22)   Total T3 2.5 nmol/L (0.9-2.8)    Which one of the following statements is correct?,Her thyroid hormone replacement is adequate,Investigation of pituitary function is required,She has a thyroiditis,She has sick euthyroid syndrome,She has tertiary hypothyroidism,A,"This question is extremely poorly presented as no one, except for the RCP, measures total thyroid hormone concentrations. However, this patient has normal TSH, low total T4 with normal total T3 and really low free T4 which would suggest that she is taking T3 as replacement therapy. This may explain why no fT3 figures are provided. Consequently she is receiving adequate replacement as reflected by the normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). She does not have sick euthyroidism as it states in the run in that these measurements were routine. Although TSH is normal and tT4 and fT4 low, secondary/tertiary hypothyroidism would not explain the plum normal total T3 concentration. She may well have had a thyroiditis such as Hashimoto's to have given her the hypothyroidism originally but she is now on replacement therapy and the former would not explain her thyroid function tests."
endocrine system,396,A rise in which amino acid concentration is typically associated with increased growth hormone release?,Alanine,Valine,Methionine,Arginine,Cysteine,D,"Growth hormone Secretion is regulated by· HYPOTHALAMUS - Growth hormone releasing hormone Somatostatin inhibits release· Glucose and fatty acids - fall in concentration stimulated GH release. Oral glucose load rapidlysuppresses GH release. Secretion increased during prolonged fasting· Amino acids (arginine especially) - increased concentration stimulates GH release· Fall in plasma free fatty acids increase GH secretion· Secretion has circadian rhythm - increased secretion during periods of deep sleep. Peakrelease during first 2h of deep sleep. REM sleep inhibits GH release· Released in discrete pulses - most frequent in adolescence· Stress - trauma, surgery, fever, exercise, anxiety, pain, cold, haemorrhage - stimulate release· Thyroxine and cortisol stimulate secretion· Somatomedines (insulin-like growth factors) - inhibit release"
endocrine system,397,"A 58-year-old woman with a history of Hashimoto's disease and hypothyroidism presents to the Emergency Department some 24 hours after taking 80 x 100 microgram tablets of thyroxine because she intended to kill herself. On examination her BP is 135/84 mmHg, and she has a resting tachycardia of 122. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 134 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 5.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 191 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 105 μmol/L (79-118)   ECG Confirms tachycardia, but no ischaemic changes seen    Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage her overdose?",Activated charcoal,Carbimazole,Diazepam,Propranolol,Propylthiouracil,D,"Overdoses of thyroxine are relatively rare, and a number of strategies have been described in their management. In reality, patients may be partially protected from thyroid hormone excess by production of reverse T3. As such, the vast majority can be managed with regular propranolol to alleviate symptoms of tachycardia and anxiety. In severe cases, plasmapheresis to remove protein bound thyroxine, and cholestyramine to reduce enterohepatic circulation of thyroxine have been advocated. Diazepam may help with symptoms but not the underlying cause i.e the overdose.  Carbimazole and Propylthiouracil are used in the treatment of Grave's disease and hyperthyroidism. Activated charcoal is not effective at 24 hours post overdose."
endocrine system,398,"A 28-year-old woman presents to the clinic because she has had no periods for the past four months, she also suffers from problems with vaginal dryness during intercourse, and milk leakage when her boyfriend stimulates her breasts. On examination her BP is 122/70 mmHg, her pulse is 67, and her BMI is 23. You can express milk on minimal nipple palpation. You suspect hyperprolactinaemia. Which of the following prolactin levels fits best with drug related hyperprolactinaemia?",800,1500,3000,5000,10000,A,"Hyperprolactinaemia is commonly related to medication use. Levels less than 1000 are most likely to be drug related, the 1500 option is an intermediate level between that seen with drug related hyperprolactinaemia and a microprolactinoma. The drug class most commonly associated with hyperprolactinaemia are the dopamine antagonists, although a range of others may be implicated, these include :  Antidepressants Verapamil Methyldopa Opiates Protease inhibitors Omeprazole, and H2 antagonists.  800 is the correct answer because it most closely reflects a prolactin within the range of that usually associated with drug induced hyperprolactinaemia. 1500 is incorrect because it may be due to drug induced hyperprolactinaemia or related to a microadenoma. 3000 is incorrect because it is more consistent with a microprolactinoma. 5000 is incorrect because it is more consistent with either a micro- or macro-prolactinoma. 10000 is incorrect because it is more consistent with a macroprolactinoma."
endocrine system,399,"A 41-year-old woman presented asking for treatment to prevent osteoporosis. She was one year post-menopausal, is aware of flushes at night and has a family history of osteoporosis. Which one of the following therapies would be most appropriate?",Calcium and vitamin D supplements,Continuous oestrogen,Cyclical etidronate and calcium,Cyclical oestrogen and progestogen,Vitamin D supplements,D,"This patient with a family history of osteoporosis is one year post-menopausal and has symptoms. Calcium and Vitamin D supplements with a good diet would be unnecessary and are unproven in this age group. There is no suggestion that she has had a hysterectomy and so an unopposed oestrogen would be contra-indicated. Etidronate is licensed for the prevention of further osteoporotic fractures, prophylaxis against corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis and use when hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is contraindicated. In this patient's case, and in the absence of any specific contraindications (thromboembolic disease, breast cancer), combined HRT would be the treatment of choice despite the recent literature indicating increased risk of vascular disease. One would use HRT in the symptomatic (menopausal symptoms) but not in the asymptomatic where possibly bisphosphonates would be preferred."
endocrine system,400,"An 18-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of acne and hirsutism. She has no medical history of note and her only medication is the oral contraceptive pill. On examination her BP is 140/82 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular, and her BMI is 28. There are obvious features of virilisation.

This results in cortisol deficiency, aldosterone deficiency, and androgen excess. The classical form has its onset in infancy or childhood. The non-classical andquot;mildandquot; form, as here, can present in later childhood or adolescence. 17-OH progesterone is elevated because of the enzyme deficiency. 21-hydroxylase deficiency leads to a reduction rather than an elevation in aldosterone and cortisol levels. Due to the enzyme block, cortisol cannot be made effectively and androgens are made instead. Urinary 17-ketosteroid levels (androgen metabolites) are elevated in the condition. 21-OH progesterone levels are not elevated in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)."

endocrine system,403,A 70-year-old female presents with a six month history of frontal headaches and weight loss. On examination a bitemporal hemianopia was noted. Which of the following suggest the diagnosis of a pituitary tumour?,9 am cortisol concentration of 350 nmol/L (200-700),LH concentration of 44 uL (>30),Prolactin concentration of 650 mU/L (50-550),Random growth hormone concentration 1 µg/L (less than8 µg/L),TSH concentration of 3.8 mU/L (0.5-4.5),C,"The raised prolactin would most likely reflect stalk compression in this patient. Otherwise, the normal cortisol would be unhelpful as is the normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The elevated luteinising hormone (LH) is a reflection of this patient being menopausal. Growth hormone (GH) concentrations are frequently undetectable as they are released episodically usually during the night."
endocrine system,404,From what molecule is DHEA synthesised?,Estrone,Estradiol,Progesterone,aldosterone,Cholesterol,E,"Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is a steroid hormone synthesised from cholesterol (via Pregnenolone) by the adrenal glands.The fetus manufactures DHEA, which stimulates the placenta to form estrogen, thus keeping a pregnancy going. Production of DHEA stops at birth, then begins again around age seven and peaks when a person is in their mid-20s"
endocrine system,405,A 16-year-old female patient is referred with primary amenorrhoea. Investigations reveal a 46 XY karyotype. Which of the following concerning the condition is true?,A diagnosis of Turner's syndrome is likely,It is likely that her mother received carbimazole for thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy,Low testosterone and oestradiol concentrations would be expected,The diagnosis is likely to be androgen insensitivity syndrome,The diagnosis is Noonan's syndrome,D,"A female phenotype can occur in androgen insensitivity syndrome due to an androgen receptor defect. This was previously referred to as testicular feminisation syndrome. Stilboestrol therapy has been associated with the induction of latent tumours and with influencing sexual behaviour, but is not associated with abnormalities of sexual identity. In Noonan's syndrome, infants are males but physical features resemble those found in Turner's syndrome. Neither prednisolone nor maternal thyrotoxicosis would cause gender malassignment problems."

endocrine system,407,"An 18-year-old man develops thirst, weight loss, and polyuria. Investigations confirm that he has type 1 diabetes and is treated with basal bolus insulin. He is keen to know what limitations this diagnosis imposes on career opportunities. Which of the following professions would he not be able to pursue?",Ambulance control centre worker,Civil engineer,Milkman,Physical Education instructor,Traffic police driver,E,"The armed forces, working offshore or aboard ships, air pilot, Police, Fire, or driving in the post office are career paths closed to subjects with insulin dependent diabetes. Some local authorities do permit licences to taxi drivers with insulin treated diabetes whilst others do not. The Secretary of State's Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Diabetes and Driving has recommended that drivers with insulin treated diabetes should not drive emergency vehicles. This takes account of the difficulties for an individual, regardless of whether they may appear to have exemplary glycaemic control, in adhering to the monitoring processes required when responding to an emergency situation. Caveat: The advice of the Panels on the interpretation of EC and UK legislation, and its appropriate application, is made within the context of driver licensing and the DVLA process.

This involves pelvic floor training, scheduled voiding intervals with stepped increases, and suppression of urge with distraction or relaxation techniques. Doxazosin is an alpha blocker used in the treatment of prostatic hypertrophy and hypertension. Oxybutynin is first line drug therapy for urge incontinence with tolterodine amongst appropriate second line options. Tamsulosin is an alpha-1 selective blocker used as an alternative to traditional alpha blockers for prostatic disease."

Klienfelters syndrome patients are tall males. So the likely diagnosis is Turner’s syndrome
endocrine system,414,Which of the following is associated with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)?,Delayed puberty,Hypopigmentation,Hyporeninaemia,Persistent Wolffian duct,Premature epiphyseal closure,E,"Premature epiphyseal closure is a classical feature of CAH, and is secondary to high levels of adrenal androgens. Under- and over-treatment of CAH patients puts patients at risk of short stature: over-treatment because of the glucocorticoid-induced inhibition of the growth axis. CAH is associated with precocious puberty caused by long term exposure to androgens,which activate the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadalaxis. Similarly, CAH is associated with hyperpigmentation, and hyperreninaemia due to sodium loss and hypovolaemia. The Wolffian duct is never formed in CAH.    "
endocrine system,415,"You are looking at a potential inhibitor of gastrin for the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome. When considering gastrin, which of the following correctly reflects its function or the pathophysiology associated with it?",Fasting gastrin greater than1000 pg/ml and gastric pH less than2 suggests ZE syndrome,Gastric mucosal atrophy is usually seen in ZE syndrome,Gastrin promotes small bowel mucosal growth,Gastrin receptors do not bind cholecystokinin,It is secreted by L cells,A,"Fasting gastrin levels greater than1000 with low pH is highly correlated with a diagnosis of ZE syndrome. Where levels are less than 1000 and the diagnosis is suspected, then secretin stimulation testing, (where a rise greater than200 15 minutes after dosing is considered positive), or calcium stimulation testing, (where a rise greater than395 is considered positive) may be useful. Gastrin receptors also bind cholecystokinin and as such are also known as CCK-B receptors. Gastrin promotes gastric mucosal growth and as such gastric mucosal hypertrophy is seen in the ZE syndrome. Gastrin is synthesised in G cells which are found in gastric pits, primarily in the antrum of the stomach. "
endocrine system,416,"A 42-year-old man is referred to the endocrine clinic with a short history of hypertension, headaches, and palpitations. Which investigation would be most useful in this situation?",24-hour urinary metanephrines and catecholamines,MRI brain,Parathyroid hormone levels,Plasma calcium level,Thyroid function tests,A,"The symptoms are highly suggestive of a pheochromocytoma. Raised 24-hour urinary metanephrines and catecholamines are diagnostic in more than 95% of patients. Hypertension is not a feature of thyroid function derangement. The symptoms are not suggestive of a parathyroid adenoma. Pituitary adenomas can usually be seen on MRIs of the brain, but again this collection of symptoms is not classical of a pituitary cause. Pheochromocytomas are tumours of the adrenal medulla. They present with headaches, palpitations, sweating, and patients can be hypertensive. A small group of patients are asymptomatic. They are mostly benign but can occur outside the adrenal glands. Diagnosis should initially be confirmed biochemically. "

Metyrapone blocks cortisol production.Recurrence after pituitary surgery is of the order of 20‐40%.Yttrium implantation is never used these days.
endocrine system,418,A 65 year old was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus the previous year.  He has ongoing problems with biliary colic. He has recently lost weight and is complaining of loose malodorous stools up to 5 times a day. He is suffering from nausea and abdominal pain.    He is found to be anaemic.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Glucagonoma,Somatostatinoma,Insulinoma,VIPoma,Gastrinoma,B,"The classical presentation of somatostatinoma is diabetes, cholelithiasis, weight loss, steatorrhoea/diarrhoea and hypochlorhydria. They can be found in the pancreas and duodenum.  In the duodenum they can lead to obstructive symptoms and lead to obstructive jaundice.  They can metastasise to the liver.  There is raised fasting somatostatin levels.  In glucagonoma you would not expect biliary colic to be a feature and in the majority of cases necrolytic migratory erythema is present.  Gastrinoma and VIPoma would not explain all the features.  Insulinoma leads yo hypoglycaemia."

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) may be less than twice the upper limit of normal in primary hyperparathyroidism. PTH-related peptide can be raised in a number of malignancies. Old PTH assays may have also picked up PTH-rp but modern assays are able to distinguish between the two. Several indications for parathyroidectomy exist including:  serum albumin-adjusted calcium greater than 0.25 mmol/L above the normal range 24 hour total urinary calcium excretion greater than 10 mmol creatinine clearance reduced by 30% or more bone mineral density T-score less than −2.5 at any site age less than 50, and unwillingness of patient to follow advice of medical surveillance.

endocrine system,421,A 60-year-old male with diet controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus is commenced on metformin due to deteriorating glycaemic control. Which of the following is true regarding metformin?,As a sole agent it does not require any functioning pancreatic islet cells for its action,It is contraindicated in the immediate period following a myocardial infarction,It is safe in patients with renal impairment,It may cause metabolic alkalosis,It often causes hypoglycaemia,B,"Metformin is a biguanide which acts to improve insulin sensitivity through mechanisms that involve hepatic gluconeogenesis and improved muscle glucose utilisation. Thus, some insulin must be produced for it to have an effect. It is associated with hypoglycaemia although this side effect is unusual. It is contraindicated in subjects with renal failure, hepatic failure and heart failure due to the association with lactic acidosis. It is also contraindicated immediately following MI due to tissue hypoxia which is a risk factor for the development of lactic acidosis. The British National Formulary (BNF) states that there should be a six week andquot;cooling offandquot; period post-MI before the commencement or recommencement of metformin."

Which is the most appropriate initial investigation for this patient?",1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test,9 am plasma cortisol concentration,24 hour urinary free cortisol concentration,ACTH concentration,A short Synacthen test,C,"This patient is likely to have Cushing's syndrome. It is a difficult choice between an overnight dexamethasone suppression test and the urine free cortisol estimation and there are no clear national guidelines regarding which is best. However, Prague et al.^1 state that if the clinical suspicion of endogenous Cushing's syndrome is high then either a 24 hour urinary free cortisol (if the patient has normal renal function) or a late night salivary cortisol are the most likely to make a diagnosis. If the clinical suspicion is low and the aim is to exclude Cushing's syndrome then late night salivary cortisol or an overnight dexamethasone suppression test are more appropriate due to their higher sensitivities. 9 am cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations will not confirm the diagnosis. A short Synacthen test is used to confirm hypoadrenalism. "
endocrine system,423,Which of the following is true regarding oxytocin?,Is a large polypeptide,Is synthesised in the posterior pituitary,Causes milk ejection,Is released directly into the circulation from its site of production,Relaxes the uterus,C,Oxytocin is synthesised in the hypothalamus and passes down the nerve axons to the posterior pituitary to be released into circulation. The other hormone released by the posterior pituitary is antidiuretic hormone.Oxytocin is involved in the control of smooth muscle contraction in the uterus and milk release from the lactating breast (the 'milk ejection reflex').Oxytocin is a small peptide containing 9 amino acids.
endocrine system,424,A 32-year-old man has been repeatedly admitted to hospital for what was described as anxiety or panic attacks and palpitations. On occasions he is found to be tremulous and hypertensive. A persistent weight loss is noted. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Hyperthyroidism,Panic attacks,Pheochromocytoma,Cushing’s disease,GAD (generalized anxiety disorder),C,"There is no heat intolerance which goes against hyperthyroidism and panic attack and hypertension favours the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Weight loss is seen in phaeochromocytoma also. Catecholamine overproduction in pheochromocytoma affects basal metabolism, resulting in weight loss despite normal food intake"
endocrine system,425,"A 68 year old female has poor compliance with her normal medication. She is brought to A+E as she is drowsy. On examination she is overweight, hypothermic and bradycardic. There is no evidence of focal neurology. She is hyponatraemic and her glucose is within the normal range.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Stroke,Diabetic ketoacidosis,Thyrotoxic  storm,Myxoedema coma,Addisons disease,D,"This patient presents in a coma with poor compliance of her medications which suggests Addisons, hypothyroidism and DKA as the most likely cause. DKA is not correct as the glucose is normal.  The  diagnosis of myxoedema is the most likely given the examination findings of being overweight, bradycardic and bloods revealing hyponatraemia whereas is Addisons you would expect a slim patient, possibly hyperpigmented with hypoglycaemia and hyperkalaemia."
endocrine system,426,A 35-year-old man with type1 diabetes mellitus is dehydrated with BP of 90/50mmHg. What is the single most appropriate initial investigation?,ABG,CBC,HbA1c,LFT,Serum Urea,A,"Dehydration with low BP points towards probable DKA (diabetic keto-acidosis). Diabetic ketoacidosis is typically characterized by hyperglycemia over 250 mg/dL, a bicarbonate level less than 18 mEq/L, and a pH less than 7.30, with ketonemia and ketonuria. In patients with DKA, arterial blood gases (ABGs) frequently show typical manifestations of metabolic acidosis, low bicarbonate, and low pH (less than 7.3)"
endocrine system,427,A patient is found to have a cholesterol of 12 mmol/L.  He notes that his mother and grandmother had problems with high cholesterol.  He is thought to have familial hypercholesterolaemia. Which of the following features is highly suggestive of this?,Premature corneal arcus,Xanthelasmata palpebrarum,Xanthelasma,Elevated triglycerides,Tendon Xanthomata,E,Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant condition.  A common mutation is that of LDL receptors on chromosome 1 and mutations of apo B 100.  Tendon xanthomata is a hallmark of the disease and is highly suggestive of it.  There is elevated LDL but triglycerides are normal.  The other options are not specific to familial hypercholesterolaemia and can occur in any cause of high cholesterol. By age 50 there is a a greater than 50% risk of coronary heart disease in men and 30% in females by age 60.
endocrine system,428,"A 33-year-old female presents with tiredness and lethargy. Five years previously she had undergone a frontal surgery for a craniopharyngioma following presentation with amenorrhoea and headache. Postoperatively, she developed seizures and was treated with sodium valproate. She was demonstrated to be hypopituitary and receives hydrocortisone, thyroxine, oestrogen replacement therapy, and desmopressin. Which of the following investigations would you select to confirm a growth hormone deficiency (GHD)?",Clonidine test ,GHRH/arginine test,IGF-1 concentration ,Insulin tolerance test ,L-dopa test ,B,"This patient is more than likely to be GH deficient which would explain the lethargy but this requires confirmation before initiating treatment. Although an insulin tolerance test is the gold standard for the diagnosis of GHD, it is contraindicated due to the epilepsy. Therefore GHRH/arginine is regarded as a suitable alternative. IGF-1 levels can be used as marker of growth hormone levels, but are not diagnostic. There are situations in which the IGF-1 level is normal even though there is GH deficiency. In addition, decreased levels of IGF-1 can be seen with nutritional deficiencies, chronic kidney or liver disease and with high doses of oestrogen. Neither clonidine or L-dopa levels are routinely measured when GH deficiency is suspected."
endocrine system,429,"A 48-year-old man presented to the ER with severe low back pain. X ray revealed compression fracture of L1 and L3 vertebrae. The man had had a colectomy last year for ulcerative colitis with ileal pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA). He had had no symptoms of colitis since but had lost 8 Kg of weight after the surgery. His diet was normal. A recent medical check-up record was available which showed hemoglobin 120 g/L, bilirubin 1 mg/dl (N: 0.3-1 mg/dl), calcium 1.8 mmol/L (N: 2.2-2.6), phosphate 0.7 mmol/L (N: 0.8-1.4), alkaline phosphatase 230 IU/L (N: 50-150), Albumin: 42 g/L (N: 40-50 g/L). What is the likely explanation for his clinical presentation?",Age related bone loss,Hepatic osteodystrophy,Inadequate dietary intake,Vitamin D deficiency,Weight loss,D,"This patient shows hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia and raised alkaline phosphatase levels. This, along with radiological evidence of bone fragility, is suggestive of vitamin D deficiency (VDD). Studies have shown that colectomy with IPAA in inflammatory bowel disease leads to osteopenia and vitamin D deficiency. After formation of IPAA, villous atrophy occurs and also there is bacterial overgrowth leading to deconjugation of bile acids. Thus, vitamin D absorption is hampered. In age-related bone loss, there is no change in calcium and phosphate levels in serum. Also, this bone loss due to senility does not occur at 48 years of age. Hepatic osteodystrophy is a low bone turnover state in chronic liver disease. The cause is multifactorial. But there is no mention of chronic liver disease here. Similar to the previous option, there is no mention of inadequate dietary intake. There is mention of weight loss. The weight loss mentioned here can occur after colectomy due to altered intestinal absorption. Weight loss can, in itself, cause osteoporosis. But the metabolic alterations of VDD will not be found.

Polycystic ovaries develop when the anterior pituitary produces excess LH, in response to increased GnRH pulsality or hyperinsulinaemia. This results in excess secretion of androgens from the ovary, particularly testosterone. However, if the testosterone is significantly raised, it is important to exclude other conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (although this lady is a little old for this to be a new presentation) and androgen-secreting tumours. The exact cause of PCOS is unknown, but the condition appears to be familial. Symptoms include oligomenorrhoea, subfertility, acne, hirsutism, and psychological symptoms. Prolactin and TSH should not be significantly altered in PCOS, and if they are you should investigate for alternative diagnoses. Treatment is complex, but is primarily focused at managing the symptoms. Weight loss has also been shown to improve clinical symptoms."
endocrine system,431,Which of the following techniques is the best in differentiating between ectopic Cushing's syndrome and pituitary dependent Cushing's disease?,ACTH concentrations,CRF test,High dose Dexamethasone suppression test,Inferior petrosal sinus sampling,Urine free cortisol,D,"Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is an extremely sensitive, specific and accurate test for differentiating between Cushing's disease and ectopic ACTH production. It samples venous blood draining from the pituitary gland, using a femoral approach. A raised ACTH from here compared to the periphery suggests a pituitary cause. When done by experienced operators, the complication rate is low and is most commonly only groin haematoma. The high-dose dexamethasone suppression test can differentiate between the two forms of Cushing's syndrome, but is not as accurate as inferior petrosal sinus sampling. Urine free cortisol, corticotropin-releasing factor stimulation, and ACTH concentrations are not specific at differentiating between the two forms."

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia results from a defect in the biosynthetic pathway of cortisol and/pr aldosterone. Non-classical forms are characterised by milder enzyme dysfunction, and therefore usually only manifest in adolescence or adulthood. The most common form is 21-hydroxylase deficiency. The ACTH stimulation test is the best screening evaluation, and can diagnose 21-OH deficiency when the plasma 17-OH progesterone are more than 30 nmol/L. N-classical adrenal hyperplasia is not characterised by cortisol insufficiency, and as such glucocorticoids are rarely indicated. If the main concern is infertility, ovulation induction is the treatment of choice. If, as in this case, hirsutism is the presenting problem then anti-androgens (such as flutamide) should be used. Metformin, pioglitazone, and weight loss are all therapies which may increase insulin sensitivity in the context of polycystic ovarian syndrome. Although this woman may benefit per se from weight loss, she is likely to derive most symptomatic benefit from an anti-androgen. "
endocrine system,433,"A 68-year-old woman diagnosed with Type2 DM and BMI 33. Laboratory investigations: GFR 29, urea 13, creatinine 390mmol/L. what is the next appropriate management?",Biguanide,Sulfonylurea,Insulin,Glitazone,Sulfonylurea receptor binder,C,"Insulin is devoid of significant side effect than Glitazones (like fluid retention). In renal failure there is reduced GFR and some fluid retention. It is not desirable that glitazone to cause more fluid retention by causing oedema. The oral agents that are thought to be relatively safe in patients with nondialysis CKD include short-acting sulfonylureas (eg, glipizide) and repaglinide. If an oral agent is used, the short-acting sulfonylurea, glipizide, is the preferred agent among nondialysis CKD patients who have an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73. The dose for glipizide is 2.5 to 10 mg/day. Glyburide and other long-acting sulfonylureas are generally not recommended in any CKD patient with type 2diabetes, because of the risk of hypoglycemia. Some clinicians recommend the use of the meglitinide repaglinide (starting with a dose of 0.5 mg) for nondialysis CKD patients since these agents are not renally cleared. Nondialysis CKD patients with type 2 diabetes may be treated with an oral agent, although many patients end up on insulin therapy because it is more effective. So it may be that we can go for insulin as the answer!!"

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Addisons,PTH like peptide secretion secondary to malignancy,Hyperparathyroidism,Sarcoidosis,Thyrotoxicosis,B,"This patient has hypercalcaemia. Although all of the options can result in hypercalcaemia, the history is suspicious of a lung cancer and thus the hypercalcaemia is most likely secondary to PTH like peptide secretion and thus hypercalcaemia."
endocrine system,435,"A 64-year-old woman is taking long term amiodarone therapy for the management of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She reports that over the past few months she has had mental slowing, weight gain, and hair loss. On examination her BP is 139/80 mmHg, her pulse is 48, and her BMI is 30. She has obviously thinning, dry hair. You measure her TSH which is elevated at 12 IU/l (0.5-4.5). Which of the following is the most likely pathophysiological explanation for her hypothyroidism?",Desethylamiodarone driven inhibition of T3,Inhibition of type 1 5-deiodinase activity in peripheral tissues,Inhibition of type 2 5-deiodinase activity in the pituitary,Inhibition of T3 uptake into peripheral tissues,Iodine driven inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis,E,"Iodine driven inhibition is the only option where amiodarone related events leading to hypothyroidism are described. Production of thyroxine is under a degree of negative feedback such that where iodine levels are very high, thyroxine production may become inhibited. This is more likely to occur where there is underlying Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Desethylamiodarone driven inhibition of T3 and inhibition of type 1 5-deiodinase activity in peripheral tissues are known to precipitate an increase in thyroid hormone levels. A rise of between 20% and 40% is seen in patients between one and four months after starting amiodarone therapy. As this may not necessarily constitute the development of thyrotoxicosis, treatment is not usually indicated without clinical symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Inhibition of the entry of tri-iodothyronine (T3) into peripheral tissues also leads to a rise in thyroid hormones during the first few months after treatment. Inhibition of type 2 5-deiodinase activity leads to a rise in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) during the first one to two months after starting amiodarone, but levels usually return to normal about three to four months after starting therapy, and no intervention is required."
endocrine system,436,"A 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes comes to the nephrology clinic for review; he complains of increasing bony aches over the past few months. His diabetes is managed with gliclazide, and he also takes ramipril, amlodipine, indapamide, atorvastatin, and aspirin. On examination his BP is 155/88 mmHg, his pulse is 82 and regular, his BMI is 29. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 104 g/L (115 - 165)   White cells 8.4 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelet 183 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135 - 146)   Potassium 5.3 mmol/L (3.5 - 5)   Creatinine 187 µmol/L (79 - 118)   Calcium 2.15 mmol/L (2.20 - 2.60)   Phosphate 1.9 mmol/L (0.8 - 1.5)   PTH 14.2 pmol/L (1.0 - 6.1)    PTH was 8.5 1 year earlier. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Osteomalacia,Osteoporosis,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Secondary hyperparathyroidism,Tertiary hyperparathyroidism,D,"Secondary hyperparathyroidism is the correct answer; the raised creatinine, borderline low calcium, and raised phosphate are consistent with the condition. Phosphate retention and a lack of hydroxylated vitamin D drives increased levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as the body strives to retain calcium. Patients with renal disease however are not treated for hyperparathyroidism until the PTH level breaches twice the upper limit of the normal range. This is because of the risk of precipitating adynamic bone disease. Usual first line therapy is weekly 1-alphacalcidol. Whilst decreased levels of hydroxylated vitamin D drive an increase in PTH, low vitamin D levels are not the primary pathology, so osteomalacia is incorrect. Osteoporosis is incorrect because the bloods we are provided with are consistent with metabolic bone disease. Primary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect because the hyperparathyroidism is driven by chronic renal impairment. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism is incorrect because of the relatively short duration of his bone and joint pains, and as yet uncorrected calcium and phosphate."

She requires confirmation of the suspected diagnosis and this should be undertaken with a 72 hour fast. If the patient develops symptoms, then a plasma glucose is measured and if low, insulin and C-peptide is then collected and the fast terminated. We have been provided with a fasting plasma glucose on this patient which is normal. Measuring insulin and C-peptides with this normal glucose would provide no meaningful information.

endocrine system,438,A 45-year-old man has an ulcer on his right foot. He has had type 1 diabetes for 20 years. There is a small ulcer of 2 cm diameter on the outer aspect of his right big toe. His peripheral pulses are all palpable. He has a peripheral neuropathy to the mid shins. The ulcer has an erythematous margin and is covered by slough. Which is the most likely infective organism?,Escherichia coli,MRSA,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pyogenes,D,"Diabetic foot ulcers can be divided into:  Those in neuropathic feet, and Those in feet with ischaemia.  The neuropathic foot is warm and well perfused with palpable pulses, sweating is decreased and the skin may be dry and prone to fissures. The ischaemic foot is cool and pulseless with thin, shiny skin which often lacks hair. There may also be atrophy of the subcutaneous tissues, but intermittent claudication and rest pain may be absent due to co-existent neuropathy. Diabetic foot infections are common and always serious, and range in severity from superficial paronychia to deep infection and gangrene. Other manifestations include:  Cellulitis Myositis Abscesses Necrotising fasciitis Septic arthritis Tendonitis, and Osteomyelitis.  All are associated with increased frequency and length of hospitalisation, and risk of lower extremity amputation. Neuropathy, vascular insufficiency and reduced neutrophil function all mean that diabetics are more susceptible to foot ulceration. Once skin ulceration occurs, the underlying tissues are exposed to colonisation by pathogenic organisms. The inflammatory response is often impaired, and therefore early signs of infection may be subtle. Local signs of wound infection are:  Granulation tissue that becomes increasingly friable Yellow or grey moist tissue at the base of the ulcer Purulent discharge, and An unpleasant odour.  The most common pathogens in acute, previously untreated superficial ulcers in diabetic patients are aerobic Gram positive bacteria (particularly Staphylococcus aureus and beta-haemolytic Streptococci). In patients who have recently received antibiotics or who have deep tissue involvement, infection is usually caused by a mixture of aerobic Gram positive, Gram negative (for example, Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella) and anaerobic organisms (for example, Bacteroides, Clostridium). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is more common in patients who have been previously hospitalised or who have received antibiotic therapy, although increasingly it is community acquired. If infection is suspected, deep swab and tissue samples should be sent for culture and broad-spectrum antibiotics started. The presence of deep infection with abscess, cellulitis gangrene or osteomyelitis is an indication for hospitalisation. Indications for urgent surgical intervention are:  A large area of infected sloughy tissue Localised fluctuance and expression of pus Crepitus in the soft tissues on radiological examination, and Purplish discolouration of the skin (which indicates subcutaneous necrosis).  Antibiotic treatment should subsequently be tailored according to the clinical response, culture results and sensitivity. If osteomyelitis is present, surgical resection should be considered and antibiotics continued for four to six weeks. "

She was recently diagnosed by her GP with thyrotoxicosis after presenting with weight loss and palpitations and found to have a TSH of less than0.05 mU/L. On attendance in the Emergency Department she is found to have marked Graves' eye disease. She is started on high dose oral corticosteroids. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention for her thyrotoxicosis?,High dose carbimazole and thyroxine replacement,Low dose carbimazole,Potassium perchlorate,Radioiodine,Surgery,A,"Stability with respect to thyroid function is the key with respect to avoiding progression of thyroid eye disease. In particular, periods of hypothyroidism can significantly worsen peri-orbital oedema and thus lead to further symptoms related to optic nerve compression. As such, block replace with high dose carbimazole and full dose thyroxine replacement is the optimal step. This may be continued for up to 18 months until thyroid eye disease is stable. Low dose carbimazole is incorrect as using carbimazole alone is likely to require frequent dose adjustment and runs the risk of inadvertently dipping into hypothyroidism. Potassium perchlorate is an option for patients with severe thyrotoxicosis where surgery is planned within a very short time period. Radioiodine is known to lead to transient worsening of thyroid eye disease in some patients, and surgery is generally considered an option for patients who are unable to take thionamides or undergo radioiodine therapy."

Elevated prolactin concentrations, although a feature of PCOS, is not specific of the diagnosis and may suggest microprolactinoma. Although insulin resistance is a feature of PCOS, a raised insulin concentration is rather irrelevant and no one would measure this in clinical practice.

This would exclude pregnancy as a cause and polycystic ovarian syndrome is also unlikely. In the presence of a raised prolactin concentration, a microprolactinoma would be the most likely explanation for this patient's symptoms and results. This may be demonstrated by a pituitary MRI scan. An insulin tolerance test would usually be entirely normal in a microprolactinoma. Urine free cortisol concentration would be helpful to screen for Cushing's syndrome, but does not help with making the diagnosis here.

endocrine system,455,What is the most common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide?,Iatragenic,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Reidel's thyroiditis,Iodine deficiency,Ord's thyroiditis,D,In the UK and most developed countries 90% of cases of hypothyroidism are autoimmune or iatrogenic. Worldwide however Iodine deficiency is the most common cause. Hypothyroidism In the UK around 90% of cases of hypothyroidism are due to autoimmune thyroiditis or a side effect of treatment for hyperthyroidism. Autoimmune thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism is often referred to as Hashimoto's but this isn't strictly correct as there are other forms of autoimmune thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism (Ord's and Reidel's). Hashimoto's is the most common form of autoimmune hypothyroidism in most of the world and typically causes a goitre. Ord's typically causes an atrophic thyroid and is the most common cause of autoimmune hypothyroidism in the UK and Europe. Reidels causes a fibrous thyroid and is very rare.
endocrine system,456,Which of the following best describes the mode of action of alendronate?,Inhibits osteoclast activity,Promotes bone matrix calcification,Promotes collagen synthesis,Promotes renal absorption of calcium,Stimulates osteoblast activity,A,"Simple bisphosphonates, such as clodronate and etidronate, inhibit bone resorption through induction of osteoclast apoptosis. Clodronate, and perhaps etidronate, triggers apoptosis by generating a toxic analogue of adenosine triphosphate, which then targets the mitochondria. For nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, the direct intracellular target is the enzyme farnesyl-diphosphate synthase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Its inhibition suppresses a process called protein geranylgeranylation, which is essential for the basic cellular processes required for osteoclastic bone resorption. Although nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can induce osteoclast apoptosis, this is not necessary for their inhibition of bone resorption."

As such the most effective treatment is a period of immobilisation in a specially made cast. The normal ESR and white cell count are against an alternative inflammatory or infective diagnosis. Whilst there is some evidence that bisphosphonates improve the prognosis of the condition, they are likely to be ineffective in the absence of immobilisation. It is clear that improved blood pressure control and diabetes control will impact on progression of microvascular disease, but they will not impact on the gross Charcot's deformity that this patient already has.

The lower back pain may be loin pain due to renal colic caused by renal calculi or due to osteoporosis. The renal impairment may be associated with renal calculi, perhaps due to calculi-induced hydronephrosis in extreme cases. Renal impairment in hyperparathyroidism is not uncommon. Chronic hypercalcaemia can compromise the renal concentrating ability leading to polydipsia and polyuria. The kyphosis may be due to osteoporosis which is commonly seen in conjunction with hyperparathyroidism. Classically, hypertension has been associated with hyperparathyroidism. Associated with myeloma one would expect a drop in albumin concentration together with a markedly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Hypercalcaemia tends to be a late sign in solid organ malignancy, and you would expect additional symptoms and signs if this patient had metastatic breast carcinoma. Patients with osteoporosis in isolation should not have hypercalcaemia. In fact, inadequate calcium intake is often a contributory factor to the development of osteoporosis. Hypercalcaemia can be present in sarcoidosis, but 50% of cases are asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, constitutional upset tends to be the most common, with skin manifestations, respiratory symptoms, and inflammatory oligoarthropathy also being a possibility. It is much less common than primary hyperparathyroidism."
endocrine system,466,Which of the following situations can cause a reduction in total body magnesium content?,Acute pancreatitis,Long term treatment with omeprazole,Myocardial infarction,Recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis,Refeeding syndrome,B,"All of the conditions listed can be associated with hypomagnesaemia, but many are due to a shift of magnesium from the blood into body cells, which are not necessarily associated with a change in total body magnesium levels. Hypomagnesaemia due to a shift between blood and cellular compartments may still require treatment and can cause symptoms if severe. Omeprazole causes hypomagnesaemia which, if severe, can cause hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcaemia. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may be due to reduced uptake of Mg^2+ ions in the gut. Omeprazole reduces acid production and raises stomach pH. An acid environment can aid release of metal ions from their binding sites in food molecules which facilitate absorption. There are numerous causes of hypomagnesaemia, which are outlined below. Inadequate intake:  malnutrition, and alcohol dependence.  Malabsorption:  inflammatory bowel disease long term PPI therapy gluten enteropathy intestinal bypass, and radiation enteritis.  Renal tubular disease:  hyperaldosteronism hyperparathyroidism obstructive uropathy potassium depletion, and drugs (including diuretics, amphotericin, cisplatin, ciclosporin, amikacin, gentamicin, laxatives, and tacrolimus).  Intracellular shift:  post myocardial infarction post parathyroidectomy recovery from diabetic ketoacidosis (K+ and PO4- also enter cells) refeeding syndrome (PO4- also enters cells), and acute pancreatitis.  When investigating the cause of hypomagnesaemia blood magnesium levels can guide but do not accurately reflect total body magnesium status. Attempts to find a marker of cellular magnesium status include measuring erythrocyte or monocyte Mg but these are not generally available. Urine Mg excretion is a useful guide. When there is inadequate intake or malabsorption, the kidneys would normally conserve Mg, giving urine Mg concentrations less than7 mmol/24 hours. The reference range is around 2-7 mmol/24 hours."

However, the history of polyuria and polydipsia, with only a marginally reduced sodium make psychogenic polydipsia the more likely diagnosis. The low sodium seen is likely to result from water overload due to excess fluid intake. Her glucose and calcium are not in the range to precipitate thirst and polyuria. In this case, cognitive therapy is likely to have the greatest impact on her symptoms. Cranial diabetes insipidus occurs following damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary affecting ADH secretion. Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus occurs when the kidneys fail to respond to ADP. Hyperglycaemia-related polyuria is unlikley given the normal blood glucose."

The abnormal liver function tests (LFTs) also suggest metastases which would not be seen with an adenoma. The overnight (i.e. low dose) dexamethasone suppression test simply determines whether Cushing's syndrome is present, which it usually is in adrenal carcinoma. It is the high dose which can help determine the location of the abnormality leading to Cushing's syndrome. Progressive weight gain is a classic symptom of Cushing's syndrome and it is one of the recognised endocrine causes of obesity. Abdominal ultrasound/CT is the most appropriate next investigation. Pituitary disease would not be expected to be associated with virilisation or abnormal LFTs. Pseudo-Cushing's and simple obesity are ruled out by the abnormal clinical findings seen here."

The best evidence seems to be for multifactorial intensive therapy as in the Steno studies from Denmark. However, in this question, as worded, BP is the simplest answer. Trials have shown that antihypertensive therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and microvascular complications. The intensity of the treatment is currently of debate. Lowering HbA1c only resulted in a significant reduction in microvascular events and, in some trials after a longer period, shows cardiovascular benefit. However, the trial showed an excess of deaths in the intensive glycaemic control arm perhaps because the intensification occured later in the course of the disease when cardiovascular disease was present and may have put participants at increased risk from hypoglycaemia. Lipid lowering therapy benefits patients with diabetes as much as those without diabetes in preventing macrovascular events in sub- group analyses but has no effect on microvascular events demonstrated so far. Adding fibrate may have an effect on retinopathy (FIELDS). The jury is out on aspirin as the ADA recommend prescribing only to high risk patients, but NICE had recommended all normotensive patients over 50 (men) or 60 (women), they now also agree with risk stratification. Weight reduction may reduce progression to overt diabetes from states of impaired glucose tolerance but has not been demonstrated to reduce microvascular risk in diabetes. "
endocrine system,473,Which of the following is a potent stimulator of Aldosterone,Hypernatraemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypokalaemia,Alkolosis,Acidosis,B,Hyperkalaemia is arguably the most potent stimulator of Aldosterone. Juxtaglomerular cells will also secrete Renin (that will ultimately stimulate aldosterone production) in response to Hyponatreamia and hypotension. Aldosterone Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone should be thought of as a renal sodium (Na) regulator. It stimulates retention of water via the followingUpregulates Na/K pumps in the DCT and Collecting ducts of the kidney nephrons resulting in Na reabsorption in exchange for potassium ionloss (water follows sodium via osmotic gradient) Upregulates epithelial Sodium channels (ENaCs) resulting in increased sodium reabsorption (ADH also stimulates ENaCs) Also has a role in H+/K+ ion exchange thus regulating acid/base balanceStimulationThere are a number of pathways that stimulate AldosteroneJuxtaglomerular cells of the kidney release Renin which stimulates Aldosterone via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis Raised potassium directly stimulates Aldosterone There are several other minor modulators of Aldosterone such as ACTH and steroid hormones.NOTEADH also promotes water retention but its mechanisms of achieving this are different to those of aldosterone.

endocrine system,476,"A 51-year-old man with hypertension, morbid obesity, and type 2 diabetes is diagnosed with pituitary-dependent Cushing's. He is managed with three antihypertensives, metformin, and gliclazide, yet his preoperative BP is elevated at 175/100 mmHg, his BMI is 32 and his fasting glucose is 11.2 mmol/l. Which of the following is most appropriate to improve his metabolic parameters prior to surgery?",Insulin,Metyrapone,Mitotane,Octreotide,Somatotrophin,B,"Metyrapone inhibits 11-beta hydroxylase and as such inhibits cortisol production. It has a relatively rapid onset of action and as such may be of value preoperatively in improving blood pressure and glycaemic control without associated weight gain of other options such as insulin. Insulin may be an option to improve glycaemic control pre surgery, but it is likely to result in further weight gain and may therefore exacerbate hypertension. Mitotane has a more delayed onset of action and as such it is less appropriate for pre-surgical use. Cushing's has no response to octreotide in the majority of patients and somatotrophin, growth hormone, has no value."
endocrine system,477,Which of the following genetic loci may be implicated in maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY)?,BRCA1 and BRCA2 (breast cancer) gene products,Glucokinase mutations,Leptin mutations,Stargardt's disease mutations,ZAC/HYMAI,B,"MODY is a heterogenous group of monogenic disorders characterised by pancreatic B cell dysfunction. The most common genetic mutations in the UK are:  glucokinase (32%) HNF1A (52%), and HNF4A (10%).  It accounts for 1-2% of diabetes cases, and is an important diagnosis as the therapy may be different compared with T1DM and T2DM. "
endocrine system,478,A 65 year old male presents after noticing a lump in his neck. This is painless and not associated with any symptoms and has increased in size over the last few months. He is tall and slim with elongated fingers. He has a previous diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma. Which of the following investigation will most likely confirm the definitive diagnosis?,Antithyroid peroxidase,Free T3,TSH,Urinary catecholamines,Calcitonin,E,From the history this patient is likely to have MEN type 2B and the history is indicative of medullary thyroid cancer. Medullary thyroid cancer produces calcitonin and therefore an elevated level is diagnostic. In all thyroid cancers the patients are most likely euthyroid. Antithyroid peroxidase and antithyroglobulin antibodies are elevated in autoimmune thyroid diseases.
endocrine system,479,"A 17-year-old woman comes to the endocrine clinic for review. She has primary amenorrhoea. Other history of note includes having no sense of smell. On examination, her BP is 110/70 mmHg, her pulse is 65 and regular. She is 170 cm in height. There is an absence of secondary sexual hair and breast development. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 128 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 5.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 190 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 143 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Androgen insensitivity syndrome,Autoimmune ovarian failure,Kallman syndrome,Noonan's syndrome,Turner's syndrome,C,"The clue here is the lack of sense of smell, which suggests failure of development of the olfactory bulb. This leads to a lack of GnRH and therefore lack of pulsatile LH and FSH production, lack of development of secondary sexual characteristics, and primary amenorrhoea. LH, FSH, and oestrogen levels are all low. Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) presentation is similar, but you would expect the sense of smell to be preserved. Often, phenotypic females with AIS also have cryptorchidism where the testes present as bilateral direct inguinal hernias in infancy. Autoimmune ovarian failure would present as secondary amenorrhoea, and development of secondary sexual characteristics would be preserved. Turner's is associated with short stature, webbing of the neck, hypertension, and a number of other abnormalities. Noonan's is phenotypically similar to Turner's in females, but also occurs in males."
endocrine system,480,Which of the following is a feature of pseudohypoparathyroidism?,Increased urinary phosphate and cAMP with PTH infusion,Low serum calcium and high serum phosphate,Low serum calcium and low serum phosphate,Low serum PTH,Shortened second and third metacarpals,B,"The biochemistry shows a hypocalcaemia with hyperphosphataemia being usual but elevated PTH due to resistance to parathormone (PTH). This is due to mutation of the PTH receptor with abnormality of the Gs alpha subunit with reduced cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production following a PTH infusion. There are associated phenotypic signs including short stature, low IQ, and shortened fourth and fifth metacarpals."
endocrine system,481,A 54-year-old female presented with a neck swelling which has been more noticeable over the previous four months. Examination revealed a moderate goitre and clinically she appeared euthyroid. Investigations revealed:    T4 13.1 pmol/L (10-22)   TSH 5.3 mU/L (0.4-5)   Anti-microsomal antibodies Positive    Which is the most likely explanation of this patient's goitre?,Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma,De Quervain's thyroiditis,Graves' disease,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Multi-nodular goitre,D,"This patient has goitre with subclinical hypothyroidism, as reflected by elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone but normal thyroxine and elevated microsomal antibodies (aka anti TPO antibodies). This suggests a diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
endocrine system,482,"A 42-year-old woman who is known to have Hashimoto's thyroiditis presents to the clinic with muscle pains and fatigue, and pins and needles affecting her hands intermittently. She takes no regular medication apart from thyroxine replacement. Clinical examination is unremarkable. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 122 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 6.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 190 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 108 µmol/L (79-118)   Calcium 2.05 mmol/L (2.20-2.61)   Phosphate 1.65 mmol/L (0.8-1.5)   Alkaline phosphatase 62 U/L (39-117)    Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage her symptoms?",Calcitonin,Calcium and vitamin D3,Cinacalcet,PTH analogue,Risedronate,B,"The blood picture raises the possiblity of osteomalacia, as such calcium and vitamin D are most appropriate. Hypophosphataemia is only present in 25% of cases of osteomalacia, and therefore this level should not preclude the diagnosis. Calcitonin is licensed for the treatment of osteoporosis and is therefore not appropriate here. Risedronate is a bisphosphonate, which can also be used to treat osteoporosis. Cinacalcet is appropriate for the treatment of tertiary hyperparathyroidism where the patient cannot undergo surgery, such as occurs in chronic kidney disease. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) analogues are used in the treatment of osteoporosis."
endocrine system,483,A 46-year-old woman has gained weight. She has sensitivity to cold. Her pulse is regular at 50 bpm and heart is enlarged. What is the single most likely underlying mechanism for this condition,Autoimmune,Degenerative,Congenital,Infective,Nutritional,A,The most common cause of hypothyroidism in UK is autoimmune hypothyroidism. In developing countries it is often nutritional (iodine deficiency).The diagnosis is autoimmune hypothyroidism (in hypothyroidism heart is often gets enlarged)
endocrine system,484,A 52-year-old woman presents with tiredness and weight gain. She is confirmed to have autoimmune thyroiditis. Which of the following tumours is she at increased risk of developing?,Anaplastic carcinoma of the thyroid,Follicular carcinoma of the thyroid,Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid,Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid,Thyroid lymphoma,E,There is a small but recognised risk of developing thyroid lymphoma associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (also known as Hashimoto's disease or lymphocytic thyroiditis). The risk is small and would certainly not be screened for.  None of the other subtypes of thyroid malignancy is thought to be associated with autoimmune thyroiditis.  
endocrine system,485,"A 24-year-old law student attends with visual loss affecting the right eye. She reports a constant headache for the last three months, and absence of menses for six months. On examination her visual acuity in the right eye is 6/24, with slight constriction of both temporal visual fields but she has no other neurological deficit. She is afebrile and haemodynamically stable. What is the diagnosis?",Glaucoma,Migraine,Multiple sclerosis,Pituitary tumour,Pregnancy,D,"This patient has a pituitary lesion; the history of headache and amenorrhoea suggests a prolactinoma or non-functioning tumour. This has been complicated by involvement of the visual pathway, which has precipitated her visual loss. She needs urgent assessment of her pituitary function, imaging of the pituitary gland by MRI scanning. One of the most important investigations to perform would be a serum prolactin. The amenorrhoea would argue against this being retrobulbar neuritis associated with MS and similarly the peripheral visual field constriction would be unusual as a central scotoma and fluctuating visual loss would be more typical."
endocrine system,486,"You are planning to start a 72-year-old man who has chronic renal failure and secondary hyperparathyroidism on 1,25-OH vitamin D supplementation. Which of the following correctly represents an action of 1,25-OH vitamin D supplementation?",Decreased calcium reabsorption in the kidney,Decreased IL6 production,Decreased intestinal reabsorption of calcium,Decreased mobilisation of calcium from bone,Decreased muscle strength,B,"As well as its documented effects on the kidney and bone, vitamin D is recognised to modulate cytokine production and may have a role in the treatment of inflammatory disorders in the future. One example is decreased production of IL6 in response to vitamin D supplementation. With respect to calcium metabolism, the actions of vitamin D are to increase serum calcium. This includes increased intestinal absorption of calcium, increased mobilisation of calcium from bone, and increased calcium reabsorption from the kidney. Vitamin D deficiency, rather than supplementation, is thought to contribute to decreased muscle strength."
endocrine system,487,"If a patient is symptomatic with thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy, how should this be managed?",Monitor,Carbimazole,Radioiodine therapy,Block and replace,Thyroidectomy,B,Both carbimazole and propylthiouracil can be utilised during pregnancy.  Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated as is block and replace as it will lead to hypothyroidism in the foetus.  Thyroidectomy is rarely utilised if carbimazole does not control the thyrotoxicosis.
endocrine system,488,"In a caucasian patient, with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and a BMI of 50, who is already on maximal metformin and sulphonylurea, which of the following is likely to be the most appropriate drug to add to his current management?",Pioglitazone,Insulin,Acarbose,Exenatide,Sitagliptin,D,In a patient with a BMI of 50 already on maximum metformin and sulphonylurea therapy the most appropriate addition would be exenatide rather than insulin or the other options as it can lead to significant  weight loss.
endocrine system,489,An 18-year-old woman is noted to have persistent polyuria in excess of 4 litres per day whilst recovering from a head injury she sustained in a road traffic accident. Investigations:    Potassium 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Calcium 2.4 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Glucose 5.6 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)    Which is the most effective method of confirming the diagnosis?,Autoantibodies to vasopressin neurones,MRI of the hypothalamus and pituitary,Therapeutic trial of low dose DDAVP,Vasopressin concentration,Water deprivation test,E,The history and confirmed polyuria are suspicious of diabetes insipidus which is not uncommon after head injury. This can be confirmed with a water deprivation test where failure of urine concentration would be expected. A MRI of the pituitary and hypothalamus may show no abnormality but would be undertaken after the diagnosis of DI is confirmed. Similarly anterior hormone assessment would also be undertaken after the diagnosis is confirmed. A therapeutic trial of DDAVP is only appropriate if the diagnosis of DI is confirmed as primary polydipsia can also be a feature of trauma and in these circumstances DDAVP may precipitate hyponatraemia. Autoantibodies to ADH neurones are irrelevant.
endocrine system,490,"A 49-year-old man is referred to the clinic with possible Cushing's syndrome. He is grossly obese having gained 8 kg during the past six months. He has hypertension on four agents and impaired glucose tolerance. On examination his BP is 155/85 mmHg, pulse is 75 and regular and his BMI is 35. Assuming he has Cushing's, which of the following features would you most expect on routine biochemistry?",Decreased bicarbonate,Decreased sodium,Increased bicarbonate,Increased potassium,Increased sodium,C,"Metabolic alkalosis is commonly seen. Excess ACTH production leads to upregulation of corticosteroid production, increase in mineralocorticoid production, and consequent hypokalaemia with metabolic alkalosis. Whilst salt and water retention occurs in conjunction with Cushing's syndrome, this does not usually lead to hypernatraemia. Alkalosis rather than acidosis occurs. Hypokalaemia rather than hyperkalaemia is seen in some patients."
endocrine system,491,"A 26-year-old man with a three year history of type 1 diabetes presents with fever, vomiting and is dehydrated. Investigations revealed:    Sodium 148 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 3.3 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 24 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Glucose 33 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Blood pH 7.18 (7.36-7.44)    What would be the typical total body water deficit associated with his diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)?",1 litre,3 litres,6 litres,8 litres,10 litres,C,"The typical fluid deficit associated with DKA is approximately 6 litres. The initial half of this amount is derived from intracellular fluid and precedes signs of dehydration, while the other half is from extracellular fluid and is responsible for clinical signs of dehydration. Appropriate fluid replacement requires 1 litre of normal saline over the first 1/2 hour, then 1 litre over the next hour, then 1 litre over the next two hours followed by 1 litre every 4 hours depending on the degree of dehydration. Diagnosis is made by the prescene of hyperglycaemia, lactic acidosis and a low bicarbonate."
endocrine system,492,A-54-year-old male patient of diabetes mellitus with BMI 33 who has been treated using dietary control up till now presents to his GP with a fasting blood sugar of 14mmol/l and creatinine of 90 micro-mol/l. Urine shows glycosuria. No other abnormalities are found. What is the best next step in management?,Biguanide,Sulfonylurea,Insulin,Sugar free diet,ACEi,A,Patient is obese type2 diabetic with normal renal function for whom biguanide is the treatment of choice
endocrine system,493,Which of the following statements is true of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHT)?,It is associated with bone resorption by PTH to restore depressed serum calcium levels to normal,It is associated with hypocalciuria due to elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels,It is usually caused by an adenoma of a single parathyroid gland,It progresses to tertiary hyperparathyroidism with time,PTH is secreted in a pulsatile manner from the posterior pituitary and acts through PTH receptors on parathyroid cell membranes,C,"Primary hyperparathyroidism has three main causes:  adenoma hyperplasia, and carcinoma.  Adenomas are the most prevalent entity representing 80-85% of cases. Hyperplasia is the second most common diagnosis constituting 15% of cases. Carcinoma represents less than1% of total cases. All three cause inappropriate PTH release, which leads to hypercalcaemia and (usually) hypercalciuria. In secondary hyperparathyroidism hypocalcaemia stimulates the parathyroid to produce excess PTH. It may progress to tertiary hyperparathyroidism, whereby the parathyroid becomes autonomous in producing PTH even without the stimulus of hypocalcaemia, but primary does not. PTH is produced by the parathyroid gland, not the posterior pituitary. "
endocrine system,494,A 65 year old gentleman is on metformin and gliclazide however continues to have a HbA1c of 8.7%. He is not keen to commence insulin. He has previously had an episode of left ventricular failure. His BMI is 21. Which of the following should be considered next?,Pioglitazone,Insulin,Exenatide,Monitor,Sitagliptin,E,"In a patient with poor diabetic control despite being on maximum doses of metformin and gliclazide the next option is normally insulin or consideration of a thiazolidinedione, DPPIV inhibitor or exenatide if the patient is not appropriate for insulin therapy.   In this gentlemans case he is not keen for insulin and has had a previous episode of LVF and weight gain is not a concern thus sitagliptin would be the most appropriate due to the risk of pioglitazone precipitating heart failure."
endocrine system,495,A 35-year-old woman with type 1 diabetes mellitus presents for annual assessment. Which one of the following features on fundoscopy would require urgent referral to an ophthalmologist?,Asteroid bodies,Hard exudates in the macular region,Intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA),Scattered microaneurysms,Soft exudates,B,Scattered microaneurysms signify background diabetic retinopathy (DRn). IRMAs and soft exudates signify pre-proliferative retinopathy. Urgent referral to an ophthalmologist (seen within one week) is required if there is proliferative retinopathy or there is evidence of clinically significant macular oedema (hard exudates at the fovea).   
endocrine system,496,Which of the following drugs is the most likely to cause gynaecomastia?,Omeprazole,Spironolactone,Atenolol,Thyroxine,Citalopram,B,"From the options spironolactone is most likely to lead to gynaecomastia.  Other drugs which can lead to gynaecomastia include digoxin, antipsychotics, flutamide, finasteride, metronidazole, amiodarone, cimetidine, calcium channel blockers and TCAs."
endocrine system,497,"A 25-year-old nurse presents with fatigue, fever, dysphagia, tremulousnes,s and a 3 kg weight loss over the past two weeks. On examination she has a tachycardia and fine tremor. Thyroid function tests show:    Free thyroxine 40 pmol/L (10-23)   TSH less than0.01 mU/L (0.5-5.0)    Which one of the following would best support the diagnosis of de Quervain's thyroiditis?",Elevated free T3 concentration,Failure of TSH to rise following IV TRH,High titre of thyroid peroxidase antibodies,Negative four hour radioiodine thyroid uptake,Raised ESR,D,"The cause of de Quervain's thyroiditis is probably viral in origin, and results in release of T3 and T4 into the circulation in large quantities. As the condition resolves, patients become hypothyroid and then euthyroid. The ESR is often raised, but this is not as specific a finding as a radioiodine scan which demonstrates no uptake by the thyroid. In Graves' disease you would expect homogenous uptake on RAI scan, whereas a toxic nodule would show a solitary area of high uptake. Antibodies such as TPO, and TSH receptor antibodies are found in autoimmune thyroid disease. The TRH test is seldom used except in thyroid oncology. Elevated T3 is not diagnostic."
endocrine system,498,A 35-year-old woman is noted to have ++ glycosuria by her GP. Her BMI is 35 kg/m^2 and a fasting plasma glucose is 7.4 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). Which one of the following measures would be most effective in reducing her insulin resistance as a first line measure?,Glibenclamide,Insulin,Metformin,Weight loss,Repaglinide,D,"The most appropriate treatment of this obese patient with type 2 diabetes which would also substantially reduce insulin concentrations is weight loss. Glibenclamide may be associated with increased insulin resistance as it stimulates insulin secretion, as does repaglinide. Metformin would improve insulin sensitivity but would not do it as much as weight loss. The unfortunate thing is that weight loss is the most difficult strategy for the patient to adhere to."
endocrine system,499,"A 51-year-old man presents with abdominal pain, stiffness and muscle spasms. You understand that a few days earlier he injured himself when he stabbed a fork through his foot. He cleaned and dressed it himself, but refused to attend the Emergency Department for a check up. On examination he is pyrexial 37.8°C, his pulse is 95, and his BP is 105/70 mmHg. He has obvious jaw and neck stiffness on examination and his abdominal muscles are held rigid. His left foot is erythematous with signs of local infection. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 129 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 13.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 180 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 120 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most appropriate next intervention?",Human tetanus immunoglobulin IV,Immediate debridement of the wound,Local application of tetanus toxoid,Metronidazole IV,Penicillin IV,A,"Prior to wound debridement, it is crucial to give human tetanus immunoglobulin. This is because of the risk that debridement may precipitate further release of tetanus toxin into the systemic circulation. Although debridement is a logical next step after immunoglobulin, it should be delayed for a few hours if possible. Debridement is incorrect because it should be delayed until a few hours after immunoglobulin has been administered. Systemic antibiotics are largely disappointing. Whilst penicillin has been the traditional first choice, evidence suggests that where there is sensitivity to metronidazole, this is a better option. Local application of human tetanus immunoglobulin has no value."
endocrine system,500,An elderly asthmatic lady on treatment with high dose prednisolone complains of a four week history of right hip pain. She denies any significant trauma before the onset of pain. She comments that recently she seems to be developing more facial hair and adds that she has also been diagnosed with high blood pressure and diabetes. On examination she is noted to be unable to weight bear on the right side. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her hip pain?,Avascular necrosis of femoral head,Dislocation of the hip joint,Fracture neck of femur,Gout,Osteoarthritis of the hip joint,A,"This question tests the knowledge of side effects of corticosteroids, which is a common examination question. The patient has features of hypercortisolism with weight gain, hirsutism, hypertension, and impaired glucose tolerance. Avascular necrosis of femoral head is a recognised complication of steroid use and is the most likely cause of her right hip pain. It is reported to affect 3-40% of patients who take long-term corticosteroids. The mechanisms are complex, but include an imbalance in bone resorption and repair, impaired vascularity, and dysregulated apoptosis. You would expect a more acute history if the patient had a fracture or dislocation. It is unusual for gout to affect the hip joint, and she does not have other risk factors which would suggest this. Osteoarthritis is common, and is a possibility in this case. However, she is completely unable to weight bear on this side and therefore AVN is more likely to be the diagnosis."
endocrine system,501,Which of the following is a recognised feature of achondroplasia?,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Increased liability to pathological fractures,May be diagnosed radiologically at birth,Shortened spine,Subfertility,C,"Achondroplasia an autosomal dominant condition and one of the commonest forms of short-limbed dwarfism. It is caused by an activated point-mutation of the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (at 4p16.3). The incidence increases with paternal age. Epiphyseal growth cartilage fails, but there is normal bone formation and repair. There is therefore no increased risk of fracture. The homozygous form is usually fatal. Affected persons have short stature due to shortening of the limbs, but spinal length is maintained. In addition they have characteristic facies with frontal bossing and mid-face hypoplasma, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, limited elbow extension, and trident-like hands. The fingertips may only come down to the iliac crest, and the shortness of the limbs is often most marked proximally. The limbs appear broad with deep creases. It may be diagnosed radiographically at birth, or becomes obvious within the first year with disparity between a large skull, normal trunk length, and short limbs. An x ray will show metaphyseal irregularity, flaring in the long bones, and late-appearing irregular epiphyses. The pelvis is narrow in anteroposterior diameter with deep sacroiliac notches and short iliac wings. The spine shows progressive narrowing of the interpedicular distance from top to bottom (reverse of normal). Subfertility is not associated with achondroplasia. "
endocrine system,502,"A 54-year-old man who has gained significant amounts of weight over the past six months is referred to the endocrine clinic with suspected Cushing's disease. He has hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance. On examination his BP is 165/90 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular, and his BMI is 33. As part of the routine work up, a discrete mass is discovered on chest x ray. When considering further work up, which of the following is the most appropriate option to rule out/in ectopic ACTH production as a cause of Cushing's?",24 hour urinary free cortisol,High dose dexamethasone suppression test,Low dose dexamethasone suppression test,Midnight cortisol,Plasma ACTH,B,"The 8 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test and 48 hour high-dose dexamethasone test are useful when baseline ACTH levels are equivocal. They can be very useful in determining whether a patient has pituitary or ectopic ACTH production. Greater than 90% reduction in basal urinary free cortisol levels supports the diagnosis of a pituitary adenoma; ectopic ACTH causes lesser degrees of suppression. All of the other options are possibilities for determining whether there are excess circulating corticosteroids, or there is excess adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) production. They are not useful, however, in determining the origin of excess ACTH."
endocrine system,503,"A 60 year old presents with tiredness, depression, polyuria, polydipsia and constipation. He is found to have a calcium of 3.0mmol. His phosphate level is low and alkaline phosphatase high. Urinary calcium excretion is also elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sarcoidosis,Myeloma,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcaemia,Metastases,C,"The most likely diagnosis is hyperparathyroidism. This leads to elevate calcium, low phosphate, increased alkaline phosphatase and increased urinary calcium excretion. In sarcoidosis, myeloma and metastases you would not expect to find a low phosphate and in familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia you would expect to see a low urinary calcium excretion."
endocrine system,504,With respect to vasopressin (ADH),Plasma levels are increased,The renal effects of ADH are blocked by lithium,ADH release following dehydration is reduced,The renal effects of ADH are potentiated by hypokalaemia,Plasma levels fall with increasing gestation age,B,"ADH • Potent vasoconstrictor acts on arteriolar smooth muscle of skin and splanchnic circulation • Also causes bradycardia and decreased cardiac output. Physiological effect on blood pressureis very small. However, plays important role during haemorrhage and dehydration • Has CRF-like activity and stimulates ACTH release• Renal effects of ADH blocked by: hypokalaemia, hypercalcaemia, lithium therapy• Large doses of ADH cause smooth muscle contraction and can cause hypertension andstimulate peristalsis• In pregnancy plasma osmolality decreases from 285 to 275mosm/kgIn pregnancy both the plasma level of vasopressin and the release of vasopressin followingdehydration or water loading remain unchanged"
endocrine system,505,A 29-year-old female student nurse presents with a discrete thyroid swelling. An isotope scan reveals it to be a andquot;cold noduleandquot;. She has scattered local cervical lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Anaplastic carcinoma,Graves' disease,Medullary carcinoma,Papillary carcinoma,Subacute thyroiditis,D,"Papillary carcinoma makes up 75% of thyroid tumours, and this patient's age (under 45) puts her in a low risk group. Usually these tumours present as andquot;cold nodulesandquot; on isotope scanning. These cancers may extend by intraglandular spread or local lymph node invasion. They are slow growing, but may become more aggressive, spreading locally or metastasising, especially to the lung. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is from the C-cells rather than the thyroid epithelium. Calcitonin is a tumour marker, and it usually occurs in the setting MEN type 2 (i.e. you would expect a family history of malignancy). Thyroid epithelial cancers (in order of increasing malignancy and decreasing frequency) are papillary, follicular and anaplastic. Anaplastic carcinoma is very aggressive and more common in elderly subjects. Subacute thyroiditis presents with moderate thyroid enlargement, fever, malaise, and neck pain. The gland is tender, and there may be signs of thyrotoxicosis. Graves' disease commonly presents with thyrotoxicosis, and the gland takes up a normal or increased amount of radioiodine on isotope scanning."
endocrine system,506,"A 68 year old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus, for which he takes metformin, has been unwell for the last few days. He has now been brought to A and E as he is drowsy and confused. His bloods reveal a ARF, glucose of 9 mmol/l and a metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap. How would you manage this patient?",IV dextrose,IV hydrocortisone,IV fluids,Sodium bicarbonate,Insulin sliding scale,C,"This patient is likely to have lactic acidosis (given the raised anion gap) which may have been caused by metformin and renal impairment, as metformin is much more likely to lead to lactic acidosis when there is renal impairment. When a typ2 diabetic presents like this then hyperosmolar hyperglycaemia should be suspected however the glucose precludes this as a diagnosis. IV fluid resuscitation is essential and sodium bicarbonate should only be given in very specialist settings and as a last resort."
endocrine system,507,A 60-year-old patient with metastatic breast carcinoma attends clinic complaining of pain in the jaw and ulceration within the oral cavity which has persisted for four weeks following a dental extraction. She has had a course of antibiotic therapy for suspected secondary infection of the ulceration. On examination there is ulceration within the oral cavity which extends as far as the underlying mandible. Which of the following drugs is likely to be responsible for her presentation?,Anastrozole,Diclofenac,Prednisolone,Tamoxifen,Zoledronic acid,E,"The likely causative agent is the nitrogen containing bisphosphonate zoledronic acid. The clinical scenario suggests a diagnosis of bisphosphonate associated osteonecrosis of the jaw. This is a recently recognised adverse effect of bisphosphonate therapy. This is a consequence of potent anti-resorptive action of the nitrogen containing bisphosphonates. Most cases have been associated with zoledronic acid and pamidronate given intravenously for metastatic bone disease. The reported incidence in patients with malignancy treated with these drugs is between 1.3-4.0%. Dental disease is a recognised predisposing factor. The lesions usually heal with minimal surgical debridement, chlorhexidine mouthwashes, antibiotics, and analgesia. "
endocrine system,508,Which of the following statements regarding individuals with porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase deficiency is correct?,Excrete faecal PBG between acute attacks,Experience significant photosensitivity,Have a greater than 75% chance of remaining asymptomatic throughout their lives,Have markedly increased faecal protoporphyrin excretion during attacks,When manifesting clinical disease generally present within the first decade of life,C,"Porphobilinogen (PBG) deaminase deficiency is the basis of acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). Photosensitivity is unusual in AIP and patients excrete urinary PBG between and during acute attacks. Faecal porphyrin excretion is usually normal or slightly increased. Clinical disease is manifested more frequently in females, and only rarely presents before puberty: 90% of affected individuals remain asymptomatic throughout their lives."
endocrine system,509,"A 19 year old female presents with recurrent episodes of sweating, palpitations, dizziness and weakness. These episodes can occur at any time of the day but she has noticed them particularly at night. Her mother has type 1 diabetes  mellitus. You admit her for a 48 hour fasting glucose. 12 hours after admission her glucose is noted to be 2.8 mmol/L and her insulin levels  are greatly elevated. Which of the following investigation should be performed to confirm the diagnosis?",Proinsulin,Insulin Tolerance Test,Insulin Growth Factor 1 levels,C-peptide level,Glucose Tolerance Test,D,"The most likely diagnosis to consider is an Insulinoma. They are the most comon neuroendocrine tumour and the majority are found in pancreatic islet cells. 90% are benign whilst 10% are malignant. They are a feature of MEN type 1. Diagnosis is made via a fasting glucose, C peptide, insulin and proinsulin levels. Traditionally a 72 hour fast was utilised however many have shortened this to 48 hours. Sulfonylureas should also be screened for. In self administered insulin, c peptide levels would be low and therefore measuring c peptide alone is only useful in excluding this as it will be normal or elevated in insulinoma or sulphonylurea abuse. In this patient's case she does have access to insulin and the fact the episodes occur mostly at night (rather than the morning in insulinoma) suggests this may be factitious and therefore the measurement of c peptide levelsis the next most important investigation in this case. Glucose tolerance test are utilised in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Insulin stress tests are not indicated."
endocrine system,510,"A 32-year-old man is referred to the clinic with hypertension. He is currently taking amlodipine, ramipril, and bendroflumethiazide but his blood pressure in the clinic is 160/90 mmHg. Clinical examination is unremarkable and a range of investigations are arranged. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 6.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 193 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.6 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 140 µmol/L (79-118)    Ultrasound: Right kidney 6.9 cm, left kidney 10.5 cm.   Prior to testing he did not stop his medication. Which of the following most accurately reflects the likely findings on renin/aldosterone testing?",Levels are not likely to be linked to any pathology seen here,Renin and aldosterone will be low,Renin will be high and aldosterone will be high,Renin will be high and aldosterone will be low,Renin will be low and aldosterone will be high,C,"This man's hypertension is significant, bearing in mind he has elevated blood pressure even after three anti-hypertensive medications. The differential size on renal ultrasound scan raises the possibility of renal artery stenosis, which would result in elevated renin and aldosterone levels. Even in essential hypertension, renin and aldosterone may be elevated. As such the stems suggesting that both will be low, or that the levels are not linked to any pathology here must be incorrect. Hyporeninaemic hyperaldosteronism is consistent with adrenal hyperplasia or a Conn's adenoma. Hyperreninaemic hypoaldosteronism is linked to aldosterone deficiency which may be genetic in origin and would not result in hypertension. It is also important to note that ideally antihypertensives should be stopped prior to measuring renin and aldosterone, if it is possible to do so safely. In this case the gentleman is still severely hypertensive and therefore the renin and aldosterone are likely to still be raised. The effect of antihypertensives on renin and aldosterone levels (and the renin:aldosterone ratio) is shown below:    Medication Renin Aldosterone Overall Effect   Non-dihydropyridine CCB (nifedipine, verapamil) Minimal Minimal No effect   Dihydropyridine CCB (amlodipine) Minimal Decreased (minimal) No effect   Alpha blockers Nil Nil No effect   Hydralazine Minimal Minimal No effect       ACE inhibitors Increased Decreased False negative   Diuretics Increased markedly Increased False negative   Minoxidil Increased Minimal False negative   Angiotension receptor blockers Increased Decreased False negative       Beta blockers Decreased Minimal False positive   Methyldopa Decreased Minimal False positive"

They state that the dose of metformin should be reviewed if the serum creatinine exceeds 130 mmol/litre (or the eGFR is below 45 ml/min/1.73m^2). Metformin only needs to be stopped if the creatinine exceeds 150 mmol/litre (or the eGFR is below 30 ml/min/1.73m^2).  Although bariatric surgery may be associated with weight loss of 20 kg or more and reversal of metabolic abnormalities, guidlines stop short of making a recommendation qualified by body mass index (BMI). It is generally only considered where dietary changes have been made and weight loss has occured, but more significant weight loss is requried.  Whilst acarbose may result in a small degree of weight loss and modest reduction in HbA1c, it is not recommended by NICE as an initial drug treatment option.  Pioglitazone causes weight gain and increases the risk of bone fracture and as such, it would not be recommended as initial therapy here. "
endocrine system,512,A 26-year-old woman was being treated in the outpatient clinic for autoimmune hypothyroidism.

The most probable explanation is poor compliance. This also explains the slightly high prolactin concentration too; a consequence of reduced dopaminergic tone on the lactotrophs. The typical scenario is that the patients take their medication in the days before the clinic. The most likely explanation is that thyroid hormone is not being absorbed or even taken, (the compliance argument). Given that amiodarone has no effect on thyroid hormone absorption, it can't be the answer here and she is on a a stable dose."

A CXR reveals bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. She has also noticed polydipsia, polyuria and constipation over the last few weeks and bloods reveal hypercalcaemia. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the cause of her hypercalcaemia?",Hyperparathyroidism,Bony metastases,Increased hydroxylation of Vitamin D,Reduced Urinary calcium excretion,Secretion of PTH like peptide,C,This history is highly indicative of sarcoidosis. In sarcoidosis there is formation of granulomas.  Within these granulomas the macrophages lead to increased 1 alpha hydroxylation of vitamin D and thus hypercalcaemia.

As such, patients have a spectrum of external genitalia development which ranges from normal female, to female with cliteromegaly, to under-developed male (hypospadias). Cryptorchidism is common, as is the development of abdominal hernias. Unfortunately some patients are still diagnosed relatively late when they present with primary amenorrhoea in their teenage years. Kallman's syndrome is associated with failure of the olfactory bulb to develop, leading to loss of gonadotropin releasing hormones. Klinefelter's is associated with male phenotype, and an XXY karyotype. Noonan's is associated with short stature and a similar phenotype to Turner's in women, although patients with Noonan's do have normal female organs. In males, Noonan's may be associated with delayed puberty. Turner's is associated with X0 karyotype, absent uterus and streak ovaries. "
endocrine system,516,You perform a full blood count on a patient with known Addison's disease.

Several papers have been published on using eosinophil counts as a marker of adreno-cortical function. Addison's & Adrenal Insufficiency Addison's BasicsAddison's disease or chronic adrenal insufficiency is a rare endocrine disorder where the adrenals produce insufficient steroid hormones. The term Addison's refers to primary adrenal insufficiency i.e. the adrenals themselves are the source of low steroid hormone production. There are several causes of this autoimmune adrenalitis being the most common.Secondary and tertiary adrenal insufficiency refer to insufficient adrenal hormone production due to a cause external to the kidney i.e:Secondary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient ACTH production by the pituitary Tertiary adrenal insufficiency is due to deficient CRH production by the hypothalamusSigns & SymptomsHypotension Hyperpigmentation (this is due to increased ATCH production) Myalgia Arthralgia Weight loss Anxiety/personality change Coma in Addisons crisisBiochemical featuresHypercalcemia Hypoglycemia Hyponatremia Hyperkalemia Eosinophilia and lymphocytosis Metabolic acidosis

The fetus rapidly sulphates steroids, preventing biological activity.∙ The placenta has an active sulphatase to remove sulphate groups∙ Fetal DHEA-S is converted to oestradiol and oestrone. The placenta cannot produce oestriolfrom DHEA-S∙ Fetal DHEA-S is hydroxylated by the fetal liver to 16-alpha-hydroxy-DHEA-S. This is thenutilised by the placenta for OESTRIOL production. Oestriol is first detectable at 9 weeksgestation when fetal adrenal gland secretion of precursor begins.∙ In the absence of a normal fetal adrenal gland, maternal oestrogen concentrations are very low(for instance, anencephaly)∙ OESTRIOL is the main placental oestrogen.

Her thyroid function has been stable over the past few months and her most recent TSH is measured at 2.5 mU/l. She is concerned however that her eyes are more itchy and swollen and that she needs treatment from the ophthalmologist. Which of the following would prompt urgent referral with respect to her thyroid eye disease?",Change in the intensity or quality of colour vision,Increased itchiness of both eyes,Increased light sensitivity,Intermittent diplopia,Orbital ache,A,"Thyroid eye disease occurs in between 25 and 50% of patients with Graves' disease. Impaired perception of colour implies acute progressive neuropathy and as such is a consideration for urgent ophthalmological referral. Other indications for urgent referral include:  sudden deterioration in visual acuity globe subluxation swelling of the optic disc corneal opacity, and an inability for the eyelids to sufficiently cover the cornea.  High dose corticosteroids are the mainstay of initial therapy for thyroid eye disease. The role of radiotherapy remains controversial, with surgical decompression preferred by many ophthalmologists. A change in the intensity or quality of colour vision is the correct answer, as it is an indication of acute progressive neuropathy. Increased itchiness of both eyes is incorrect because increased itchiness is a common feature of thyroid eye disease, a failure to respond to topical steroids may prompt referral. Increased light sensitivity is incorrect because progressively worsening light sensitivity over one to two months prompts referral. Intermittent diplopia is incorrect because it is only progressive or worsening diplopia that should prompt referral. Orbital ache is incorrect because this is a common feature of thyroid eye disease, particularly in the mornings."

Lack of intrinsic factor may arise from deficient production by parietal cells due to antiparietal cell antibodies in pernicious anaemia (autoimmune gastric atrophy) or following total or partial gastrectomy. In the absence of intrinsic factor vitamin B12 will not be absorbed in the terminal ileum, and megaloblastic anaemia will result."

On examination there is galactorrhoea to expression and visual fields are normal to confrontation. Investigations confirm the diagnosis of a macroprolactinoma, with a prolactin concentration of 10,500 mU/L (50-500) and MRI of the pituitary revealing a 1.5 cm tumour with some suprasellar extension. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this woman?",Cabergoline therapy,Combined oral contraceptive,Pituitary surgery,Somatostatin analogue therapy,Stereotactic pituitary irradiation,A,"This young woman has a macroprolactinoma and these are exquisitely sensitive to dopamine agonist therapy and rapid tumour reduction with restoration of menses and cessation of galactorrhoea expected. If she were asymptomatic, there is no absolute requirement for treatment. Indications for treatment are adverse effect of tumour size or effects of prolactinaemia. The dopamine agonists, cabergoline and bromocriptine, reduce prolactin levels thereby allowing oestrogen levels to normalise. They are effective in most patients, but do normally need to continued long-term. Contraindications to treatment are cardiac valve fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. Pituitary surgery is rarely required in prolactinomas and is generally reserved for patients intolerant of or resistant to dopamine agonist therapy. Radiotherapy can be used to reduce the chance of tumour recurrence, but is rarely required. The fact that she does not want to become pregnant is a bit of an irrelevance. However, it is important to note that there is a small risk of tumour enlargement during pregnancy and the patient should be closely monitored by an Endocrinologist. If possible, dopamine agonists can be held during pregnancy but if treatment is required bromocriptine has the most safety data. Combined oral contraceptives can lead to mild rises in serum prolactin, and therefore should only be used with caution in patients with prolactinomas. Somatostatin analogues are used to treat carcinoid and other neuroendocrine tumours, but not prolactinomas."

As such the investigation most likely to contribute to making the diagnosis is a short Synacthen test. Abdominal x ray may be useful if adrenal calcification is suspected, and a chest x ray may reveal underlying TB, but both of these are investigations to be performed after the initial diagnosis is made. Equally, adrenal antibodies may establish if the cause is autoimmune. Random cortisol is less useful than a short Synacthen test as cortisol production varies during the course of a day."

endocrine system,533,You review a 30 year old women in clinic who's thyroid function tests have demonstrated hypothyroidism. On taking a detailed history she reports having felt tired for around 6 months and noticed some weight gain but there are no other symptoms and no recent illness. Examination reveals a non-tender hard goitre. Further bloods show anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and also anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) antibodies are present. What is the likely diagnosis?,De Quervains thyroiditis,Graves disease,Toxic diffuse goitre,Hashimoto's,Endemic goitres,D,Endemic goitre is due to iodine deficiency and wouldn't typically have positive antibodies. De Quervains Thyroiditis is also not autoimmune mediated and shouldn't result in positive antibodies. De Quervains causes hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. In the hyperthyroid phase there is typically neck pain and fever of which there is no history here.Graves AKA Toxic diffuse goitre causes hyperthyroidism. The answer therefore is Hashimotos. It should be noted that TPO antibodies are not always positive in Hashimotos. Hypothyroidism In the UK around 90% of cases of hypothyroidism are due to autoimmune thyroiditis or a side effect of treatment for hyperthyroidism. Autoimmune thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism is often referred to as Hashimoto's but this isn't strictly correct as there are other forms of autoimmune thyroiditis leading to hypothyroidism (Ord's and Reidel's). Hashimoto's is the most common form of autoimmune hypothyroidism in most of the world and typically causes a goitre. Ord's typically causes an atrophic thyroid and is the most common cause of autoimmune hypothyroidism in the UK and Europe. Reidels causes a fibrous thyroid and is very rare.
endocrine system,534,Which of the following statements regarding bariatric surgery is correct?,Associated with a significant post-operative mortality,Contraindicated in adolescents,Indicated in patients with a BMI of greater than 30,Indicated in patients with a BMI less than 35 kg/m^2,Reduces cardiovascular mortality,E,"Bariatric surgery is the only intervention for obesity that has significant and enduring weight loss and comorbidity resolution. The Swedish Obesity Study demonstrated significantly reduced cardiovascular event and death rates up to 15 years following bariatric surgery compared with usual care.^1 Bariatric surgery in adolescents raises social, psychological, and developmental issues, but adolescents are not excluded from surgery, and some hospitals have specialised programmes for younger patients. Potential candidates for surgery are those with a body mass index (BMI) exceeding 40, or BMI greater than 35 with serious comorbidities (for example, sleep apnoea, type 2 diabetes).^2 Post-operative mortality ranges from 0.1-2%. The rate of post operative complications following bariatric surgery is no greater than other elective major abdominal operations but there is a higher risk of intervention if a complication occurs. Specific post bariatric complications depend on the procedure used:  Laparoscopic adjustable gastric band - band slippage, erosion, infection, pouch dilatation, band/tubing leak, megaoesophagus. Laparoscopic roux en y gastric bypass - stomal stenosis, internal hernia, malnutrition. Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy - reflux, staple line leak, sleeve dilatation and weight gain.  "
endocrine system,535,A chromophobe adenoma of the pituitary would be expected in which of the following?,Acromegaly,Cushing's disease,Non-functioning pituitary tumour,Prolactinoma,TSH secreting tumour,C,A chromophobe adenoma refers to no uptake of dye within the tumourous specimen. This occurs in the non-secretory/non-functioning pituitary tumours. The other answers are all secretory tumours.
endocrine system,536,A patient who has been stable on thyroxine for hypothyroidism for a long time is found to have a high TSH and normal free T4. What is the most likely cause?,Poor compliance,Inadequate dose,Normal in thyroxine treatment,Low FT3,Over replacement,A,The most common cause for a high TSH despite treatment with thyroxine which was previously stable is compliance issues. If the dose were too low you would expect the T4 to be low as well as the high TSH. It may be that although T4 is normal the patient has a low T3 and this is what is causing the problem however it is less common than poor compliance.

endocrine system,538,An 18-year-old woman sustains severe head injuries in a road traffic accident. The following day her investigations show:    Sodium 160 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Chloride 120 mmol/L (95-107)   Urea 3.0 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 90 µmol/L (60- 110)    Which one of the following statements is correct?,Rapid rehydration with 5% dextrose is indicated,She has the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH),She should be treated with sodium restriction,She will have a hypercholraemic acidosis,Urine osmolality will be low,E,"There is a marked hypernatraemia with elevated chloride but normal potassium and urea in a patient with severe head injuries. The likely cause of this presentation is diabetes insipidus. Urine osmolality is therefore likely to be low. You cannot say that she has a hyperchloraemic acidosis as you do not have her bicarbonate concentration but if you assume that the anion gap would be normal, that is 10-12, then this would suggest that the bicarbonate is elevated, suggesting either a metabolic alkalosis or respiratory acidosis with compensation. Although restoration of normal volaemia and osmolality is required, giving 5% dextrose may exacerbate any cerebral oedema and so correction should be gradual."
endocrine system,539,A 22-year-old woman comes to see you with her partner. She is keen to start a family but there is a history of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (DI) affecting her male relatives. Which of the following options is the most likely underlying defect?,Aquaporin-1 gene mutation,Aquaporin-2 gene mutation,Aquaporin-3 gene mutation,V1 ADH receptor gene mutation,V2 ADH receptor gene mutation,E,"Nephrogenic DI related to vasopressin-2 receptor mutation is X linked. This fits best with only male members of the family being affected by the condition. Nephrogenic DI may also occur as a sporadic condition or be autosomal recessive, although drugs are the commonest precipitants. Autosomal recessive nephrogenic DI is related to mutations in the aquaporin-2 gene, leading to reduced water reabsorption in the distal tubule. Rarer forms of X linked recessive disease have also been described. On the other hand, the V2 ADH mutation is usually X linked recessive, and is therefore the correct answer here. Mutations of aquaporin-1, aquaporin-3, and vasopressin-1 receptors are not described in conjunction with nephrogenic DI."

endocrine system,542,A 64 year old gentleman with type 2 diabetes mellitus is found to have pre-proliferative retinopathy on his annual screening. He is obese and his blood pressure is 155/90 mmHg. He has evidence of proteinuria on urinalysis. A recent HBA1c is 8.0%. Which of the following would be most useful for reducing the progression of both the retinopathy and proteinuria?,Smoking cessation,Weight reduction,Tight blood pressure control,Improved diet,Intense Glycaemic control,C,"All of the options are obviously important however to prevent the progression of both retinopathy and renal disease, blood pressure control is the most important. Good glycaemic control is very important in the primary prevention of all complications of diabetes. UKPDS showed that tight glycaemic control can lead to a 17% reduction in risk of progression of retinopathy and a 29% reduction in need for laser.  However a rapid and intense improvement in glycaemic control can actually worsen retinopathy especially in preproliferative and proliferative retinopathy. Tight blood pressure control has been shown to reduce progression of retinopathy and development and progression of microalbuminuria. ACE inhibitors have been shown to be very effective in reducing the progression of microalbuminuria to proteinuria and renal failure. They have not yet been shown to reduce progression of retinopathy. ACE inhibitors may therefore be the preferred anti hypertensive initially."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Conns syndrome,Carcinoid syndrome,Poor compliance,Essential Hypertension,Cushings syndrome,A,"Conns syndrome leads to increased aldosterone secretion, reduced renin level, hypertension and hypokalaemia.  It is usually secondary to adrenal hyperplasia or aldosterone producing adenoma."
endocrine system,547,Which of the following is a feature of Horner's syndrome?,Dry nose on affected side,Exophthalmos,Increased sweating on affected side,Mydriasis,Myosis,E,"Horner's syndrome results from interruption of the sympathetic innervation to the head. It was originally described with cervical lesions causing damage to the T1 contribution to the cervical sympathetic chain, but may be due to lesions anywhere along the sympathetic pathway. The features of Horner's include:  Partial ptosis Myosis (contraction) Apparent enophthalmos Lack of sweating, and Nasal stuffiness on the affected side.  Myosis occurs due to paralysis of the dilator pupillae and ptosis is due to paralysis of the sympathetic muscle fibres transmitted via the oculomotor nerve to the upper eyelid. Horner's may follow:  Operations on, or injuries to, the neck in which the cervical sympathetic chain is damaged Malignant invasion from lymph nodes or adjacent tumour, or Spinal cord lesions at the T1 segment."

Which of the following is the most likely cause?",Acute blood loss,Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL),Erythropoietin deficiency,Microangiopathic haemolysis,Sideroblastic anaemia,C,The most likely cause is progressive renal failure which leads to reduced release of erythropoietin from the kidneys. Sideroblastic anaemia (myelodysplasia) is seen in older age groups. CLL or microangiopathic haemolysis are possible causes but unlikely.

endocrine system,552,In active acromegaly with associated diabetes mellitus which of the following findings would be expected?,Diabetes mellitus is due to an auto-immune process,Growth hormone concentrations are suppressed with hyperglycaemia,IGF-1 concentrations are low,There is insulin resistance,Treatment with a somatostatin analogue is contraindicated,D,Insulin resistance stems from the excessive growth hormone concentrations (anti-insulin effects) that of course fail to suppress with hyperglycaemia. Acromegaly is often effectively treated with somatostatin analogues which may improve glycaemic control. Many of the effects of growth hormone (GH) are mediated through insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 the concentrations of which are high in acromegaly. Diabetes mellitus is due to the insulin resistance and is not due to auto-immune insulinitis.

He is stable when reviewed, with a BP of 135/70 mmHg, and pulse 75 bpm and regular. His BMI is 31 kg/m^2. There is no epigastric tenderness on abdominal palpation. An Hb checked the day before clinic is 125 g/L. When is the first time his HbA1c is likely to be accurate post blood transfusion?",2 weeks,1 month,2 months,3 months,6 months,D,"Red cell life is between 100 and 120 days, which equates to slightly longer than three months. Given this man has received a significant blood transfusion, it is opportune to wait three months before re-assessing his HbA1c. This allows glycation over the previous three months to also affect the transfused red cells and avoid a falsely low HbA1c. Fructosamine is a potential alternative measure as it reflects glucose control over the previous month, and can therefore be measured earlier. All of the time periods shorter than three months risk underestimating glycation and leading to false reassurance about glucose control. Waiting for six months is unnecessary given that red cell life is approximately 100-120 days and HbA1c reflects three months of glucose control."

Pseudohypoparathyroidism occurs because of a mutation in the alpha subunit of the G protein receptor which renders it non-functioning. This leaves patients with hypocalcaemia and raised alkaline phosphatase, but with a significant elevation in PTH levels. The commonest other mutation which leads to a loss of function is that in the TSH receptor. Mutations in the gonadotrophin receptor are less common than those seen causing hypothyroidism; mutations leading to low levels of cortisol are rarer still but are reported in some patients."

Which of the following is the most likely long-term complication of this treatment?,Hypoparathyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Increased risk of developing cancer,Osteoporosis,Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage,B,"RAI is safe and that is why it is given across all ages as a definitive treatment of thyroxicosis. The most likely side effect of radioactive iodine is hypothyroidism with approximately 80% developing hypothyroidism after therapy. There is no evidence to suggest that RAI is associated with any cancers. However, RAI must not be given to pregnant females particularly after the 12th gestational week as it would be taken up by the developing fetal thyroid causing fetal hypothyroidism and is also considered to be teratogenic. Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage is a potential risk of thyroid surgery, not RAI."

endocrine system,565,A 60-year-old man who was previously fit and well presented with a six week history of blurring of vision. His investigation revealed a fasting plasma glucose of 12.9 mmol/L (3.0 - 6.0). What is the most likely cause of his blurred vision?,Cataract ,Maculopathy,Osmotic changes in the lens ,Proliferative diabetic retinopathy ,Retinal vein thrombosis,C,"Without being given too much here, this patient is a newly diagnosed diabetic as we are told he was previously fit and well. Therefore the most probable explanation for his blurred vision is osmotic change. Cataract does not fit with the clinical history nor does maculopathy.  The early diagnosis od diabetes would mean that there has not been enough time for retinopathy to set in.  Retinal vein thrombosis usually presents with amore rapid onset of total visual unioccular loss."

The answer is unlikely to be carcinoid given the lack of symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. The flushing attacks of the carcinoid syndrome are accompanied by hypotension. Renal anatomy and function are studied with sequential images using radionuclides that are indexes of tubular function (131-I Hippuran). The clinical history here is not suggestive of renal artery stenosis. Given the patient's young age, and markedly raised BP on treatment we should consider an endocrine cause. The electrolyte disturbance is mild and is of dubious relevance in this question. Diuretic use may be causing the hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia, indeed the commonest cause of hypokalaemia in hypertension is diuretic therapy. However, spironalactone use could, theoretically, mask a more significant hypokalaemia. There is no clinical history to suggest Cushing's and primary aldosteronism is not associated with a tachycardia. An aldosterone:renin ratio would not be appropriate at this stage given that the patient is receiving spironalactone. The history of episodic headaches is central to this question, together with the tachycardia. These paroxysmal headaches suggest the diagnosis of phaeochromocytoma; often the symptoms are vague and rarely is the classical presentation encountered. Patients with phaeochromocytoma may develop a severe vascular headache^1. Thomas et al.^2 reviewed the histories of 100 patients with proven phaeochromocytoma seen at the Mayo Clinic and found that episodic headache was present in 80%. It was usually of rapid onset, bilateral, severe, throbbing, and associated with nausea in about half of the cases. "
endocrine system,569,A 19-year-old female is concerned following exposure to meningococcal meningitis. Her flatmate contracted meningococcal meningitis and she now wants preventative treatment. She is generally well without any past medical history. She takes Logynon as a contraceptive agent and uses a salbutamol inhaler infrequently. Which prophylactic antimicrobial treatment would you select?,Augmentin,Ciprofloxacin,Clarithromycin,Doxycycline,Rifampicin,B,Rifampicin is a reasonable choice as prophylaxis against meningococcal infection but in this 19-year-old sexually active student may be expected to reduce the efficacy of the oral contraceptive through liver enzyme induction. Therefore Ciproxin would be the most appropriate agent from the above list as it does not induce cytochrome p450. Cipro is now considered first line prophylaxis

endocrine system,571,Which of the following is the treatment for life threatening hypokalaemia?,10 ml 10% calcium gluconate with IV 0.9% NaCL with 40 mmol/l KCl infused over four hours,10 ml 10% calcium gluconate with oral Sando-K tablets,1L IV 0.9% NaCL with 40 mmol/l KCl infused over four hours,Dialysis,Insulin and 50% dextrose infusion,C,"Hypokalaemia should be treated by administering potassium, either orally (if Kgreater than2.5 with no symptoms or ECG changes) or intravenously (if Kless than2.5 with symptoms or ECG changes). IV treatment is required in life threatening cases with cardiac monitoring often performed. Potassium should be given in NaCl. Concentration should not exceed 40 mmol/l and no more than 10-20 mmol/hour should be given. Careful monitoring of potassium, sodium and creatinine concentrations with water balance is required. Life threatening hypokalaemia should ideally be managed with cardiac monitoring. Check magnesium: hypomagnesaemia can cause refractory hypokalaemia. The following are treatments for hyperkalaemia:  10 ml 10% calcium gluconate (or calcium chloride) insulin and dextrose infusion, and dialysis."
endocrine system,572,A 17-year-old female who is 16 weeks pregnant reports that her elder brother has vitamin D resistant rickets. Which of the following is the most likely mode of inheritance of this condition?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance,Autosomal recessive,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,D,"Vitamin D resistant rickets is inherited in an X-linked dominant manner. Therefore an affected female will transmit the disease to 50% of her sons and 50% of her daughters. An affected male will transmit the condition to all of his daughters but none of his sons. In this case as the mother is unaffected, therefore there is no risk of the condition being passed to her unborn child."

endocrine system,574,Chronic alcohol abuse is typically associated with which abnormal laboratory results?,Hypermagnesaemia,Increased carbohydrate deficient transferrin,Microcytosis,Reduced AST:ALT ratio,Reduced iron and ferritin concentrations,B,"Unfortunately, most of the tests available are not specific to alcohol excess. However, a combination of several consistent abnormalities occurring together gives a better indication of the cause being alcohol related. Carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) is usually elevated and gradually falls after weeks and months of abstinence. It is very useful in some situations, where verifying abstinence is of particular importance. However, it is an expensive, time-consuming, and specialised test which limits its usefulness in routine clinical practice. The following abnormalities are common in chronic alcohol dependence:  macrocytosis elevated GGT - this is due to enzyme induction but does not necessarily indicate that there is liver damage hypertriglyceridaemia - can contribute to pancreatitis hyperuricaemia - can cause gout hypoglycaemia - can contribute to seizures and coma hypomagnesaemia hypogonadism thiamine deficiency increased carbohydrate deficient transferrin - considered a marker of chronic abuse and sometimes checked to ensure abstinence, for example, while awaiting liver transplantation iron levels are variable in alcohol dependence: hepatitis causes increased serum iron while poor diet can result in iron deficiency ferritin can be elevated in the acute phase response, but reduced in advanced liver disease due to possible reduced synthesis rates hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia are often seen in established liver disease ALT is elevated in liver disease and hepatocellular damage AST is elevated (but can also be increased in cardiac or muscular damage), and AST:ALT ratio can be elevated due to the mitochondrial effects of alcohol causing a disproportionate increase in AST. However, this is not specific."
endocrine system,575,Oestradiol,Stimulates pituitary FSH secretion during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle,Circulates in plasma bound mainly to albumin,Acts via a receptor located in the cytoplasm,Is a less potent oestrogen than oestriol,Inhibits pituitary FSH secretion during the menstrual phase of the menstrual cycle,C,"OESTROGENS∙ Steroid hormones synthesised from cholesterol and secreted mainly by the ovary but alsoby the adrenal cortex and in large quantities by the placenta∙ Three forms - Oestradiol, Oestrone and Oestriol.Oestradiol is the major oestrogen secretedby the ovary.Oestrone is mainly formed from androgens while Oestriol is an oxidativeproduct of oestradiol and oestrone∙ Oestradiol has 12 times the oestrogenic potency of oestrone and 80 times that of oestriol∙ Serum oestradiol concentrations are maximal just before ovulation on day 14 of a regular 28day cycle∙ Circulate bound loosely to plasma proteins (mainly SHBG and albumin)∙ Conjugated by the liver into glucuronides and sulphates. 20% of these are excreted in bileand 80% in urine.

endocrine system,576,"If a patient has a calcium of 3.5 mmol/L with a T score of -2.7, secondary to hyperparathyroidism, what is the best management?",Surgery,Bisphosphonates,HRT or raloxifene,Watch and Wait,Block and Replace,A,"The first line management of patients with hyperparathyroidism should be surgery if serum calcium greater than  3 mmol/l, t score of less than minus 2.5, urinary calcium excretion of greater than 10mmol or worsening renal function.  Watch and wait can be utilised in patients with mild elevation and normal renal function and bone density.  Medical management may be used if there is contraindications to surgery.  This includes raloxifene/ HRT in post menopausal women and bisphosphonates.  Block and replace therapy is utilised in hyperthyroidism and not hyperparathyroidism."
endocrine system,577,Which of the following statements best describes menarche?,Is followed by the growth spurt,Occurs later in blind girls,Occurs earlier in girls below normal weight,Usually follows an ovulatory cycle,It is preceded by the onset of breast development,E,The menarche often begins with anovulatory cycles and traditionally is preceded by pubertal development including pubic hair and breast development.Low BMI may result in delay in menarche as per anorexia.Typically the menarche is preceded by a growth spurt.In ex‐prems with retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) causing blindness menarche was earlier than their peers.
endocrine system,578,Which apolipoprotein is characteristically found in low density lipoproteins (LDL)?,Apo A-I,Apo B-100,Apo B-48,Apo C III,Apo E,B,"The main apolipoprotein in LDL is ApoB-100, which contains several very hydrophobic areas responsible for binding large quantities of lipid. It also contains a domain allowing binding to the LDL receptor. Apo A-I is the major apolipoprotein in high density lipoprotein (HDL), comprising around 70% of its protein. The remainder is largely Apo A-II. Apo A-I is thought to be responsible for reverse cholesterol transport. Apo B-48 is the major apolipoprotein in chylomicrons and is a fragment of ApoB-100 and comes from the same gene. Apo B-48 is only produced by the intestine and cannot bind to the LDL receptor. Apo C-III is present in large amounts in very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and in lesser quantities in chylomicrons and HDL. It works to inhibit the enzyme lipoproteinlipase (LPL) and to reduce hepatic uptake of chylomicron and VLDL fragments. Apo E is found in all lipoproteins except LDL. It is made in the liver and is subject to genetic polymorphisms which can affect chylomicron handling and accumulation in the population. It is important in the removal of chylomicron and VLDL remnants from the blood. "
endocrine system,579,"A 32-year-old man who is a non-smoker and only occasionally drinks alcohol presents to the outpatient endoscopy unit with worsening symptoms of indigestion. He was scoped only five months earlier, where multiple gastric ulcers were found and he was started on high dose omeprazole. Helicobacter biopsy was negative. Repeat endoscopy showed further evidence of ulceration. Investigations showed:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 7.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 210 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 114 µmol/L (79-118)   Glucose 5.2 mmol/L (less than7.0)   Calcium 2.98 mmol/L (2.2-2.61)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Gastric carcinoma,MEN-1,MEN-2a,MEN-2b,Missed Helicobacter infection,B,"MEN-1 is associated with parathyroid hyperplasia and consequent hypercalcaemia in 80% of patients, this accounts for the hypercalcaemia seen here. In addition, the recurrent/resistant gastric ulceration is likely to represent a gastrinoma, with pancreatic endocrine tumours occurring in around 70% of patients with MEN-1. There is no evidence of obstruction or a mass on endoscopy which would support a diagnosis of gastric carcinoma. Equally, negative Helicobacter biopsies, when in fact infection has occurred, are highly unlikely. With respect to MEN-2a, it is associated with pheochromocytoma, parathyroid hyperplasia, and medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. MEN-2b has the features of MEN-2a without parathyroid hyperplasia but with Marfanoid body habitus and mucosal neuromas."
endocrine system,580,Which of the following statements is correct concerning the relationship between type 2 diabetes and colonic cancer?,Increased concentrations of C peptide are a marker of increased colorectal cancer risk,Insulin treatment increases recurrence free survival after treatment of colonic cancer,The increased risk of colorectal cancer in diabetes is related to BMI,The increased risk of colorectal cancer in diabetes is related to total cholesterol,Type 1 diabetes has similar risks of colonic cancer as does type 2 diabetes,A,"Type 2 diabetes is associated with a 40-60% increase in the risk of cancer of the large bowel. This increase is linked to changes in HbA1c. Type 2 diabetes is associated with significantly higher rates of overall mortality and reduced disease-free and recurrence-free survivals after chemotherapy/radiotherapy and insulin has not been shown to have any effects on mortality. No association has been found between colonic malignancy and type 1 diabetes, nor gestational diabetes. A number of studies have independently linked high circulating concentrations of C-peptide, as a marker of insulin production, with increased colorectal cancer risk. The molecular basis has not been proven but it may be reasonable to extrapolate it is linked to the growth stimulation effects of insulin. "
endocrine system,581,"An 80-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes mellitus is referred with weakness. She had been taking bendroflumethiazide, digoxin, and tolbutamide. On examination she had a temperature of 37.8°C, a pulse of 98 bpm in atrial fibrillation, and a blood pressure of 118/72 mmHg.

This is probably due to the bendroflumethiazide which should be stopped. It is unlikely to be SIADH, of which tolbutamide is a cause, as the hypokalaemia is not typically associated. Her hyperglycaemia with an osmotic diuresis would cause dehydration. Addison's disease would be associated with hyperkalaemia, hypotension, and elevated urea."
endocrine system,582,The ovaries produce androgen and progesterone. What is the common precursor for both of these hormones?,Cholesterol,Gylcerol,Inhibin A,Pyruvate,Sorbitol,A,is the common precursor for progesterone and androgen production. Ovarian Endocrine FunctionFollicular Structure Luteal Structure FunctionsTheca Cells Thecal Lutein Cells(small luteal)Androgen (Androstenedione) production Thecal Lutein cells produce progesteroneGranulosa Cells Granulosal Lutein Cells(large luteal)Convert androgen to estradiol via aromatase Granulosa Lutein cells produce progesteroneRoles of LH and FSHFSH stimulates Aromatase production in the granulosa cells LH stimulates Androgen production in the theca (interna) cells LH also stimulates the contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the theca externa.

endocrine system,583,A 40-year-old obese man with a BMI of 36 kg/m^2 was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus one year ago. He is now eating a healthy diet and getting sufficient exercise. He did not report any osmotic symptoms and so far had been free from any micro- or macrovascular complications. He is currently not taking any medications. Investigations at his annual diabetic follow-up were as follows:    HbA1c 57 mmol/mol (20-46)   7.4 % (3.8-6.4)   Fasting plasma glucose 9.8 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   176 mg/dL (54-108)   Serum sodium 138 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 4.7 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 4.3 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 88 µmol/L (60-110)    Which would be the most appropriate management to optimise his glycaemic control?,Continue with lifestyle measures,Gliclazide therapy,Metformin therapy,Orlistat therapy,Pioglitazone therapy,C,"This obese male has sub-optimal control of his hyperglycaemia (HBA1c 57 mmol/mol) despite diet. One should aim for a HbA1c below 53 mmol/mol and so the addition of metformin would be the most appropriate choice for this man. In the event that he was not able to tolerate metformin, an alternative agent which does not increase the risk of weight gain should be prescribed, such as a DPPIV inhibitor."
endocrine system,584,"A 42-year-old alcoholic presents to the clinic with symptoms of lethargy and muscle pains. He also reports intermittent tingling and loss of sensation in his hands and feet. He admits to drinking six to eight pints of lager per day. On examination his BP is 116/72 mmHg, his pulse is 65 and regular. There are signs of chronic liver disease.

The condition is known to occur with increased frequency in alcoholics, particularly in association with hypomagnesaemia. The biochemical abnormalities automatically preclude pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism, as both the calcium and phosphate are abnormal. Pseudohypoparathyroidism may fit with this picture, but only if the PTH is elevated. In osteomalacia it would be expected to see a raised alkaline phosphatase. Hypothyroidism is not associated with abnormalities in calcium metabolism."
endocrine system,585,A 64-year-old retired Caucasian solicitor attends the surgery. He is overweight and takes little exercise. He has been treated for hypertension for five years and is controlled on 5 mg of ramipril. He also takes 20 mg of simvastatin for hypercholesterolaemia. A 75 g oral glucose tolerance test was recently performed and gave a result consistent with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) with a two hour plasma glucose concentration of 9.3 mmol/L (7.8-11.0 mmol/L). The patient is keen to know what would be his risk of developing type 2 diabetes. What do you tell him?,6% over 6 years,10% over 6 years,33% over 6 years,60% over 6 years,100% over 6 years,C,"Individuals with IGT are at significant risk of progression to type 2 diabetes. A number of studies have looked at the absolute risk of progression from IGT to type 2 diabetes. The large and widely-quoted Hoorn study which looked at 1342 Caucasian non-diabetic subjects found that 33.8% progressed to type 2 diabetes over six years follow up. This increased to 64.5% if individuals had both IGT and impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG). A similar rate of progression for individuals with IGT was Vaccaro who studied a Caucasian group in Italy. Intensive lifestyle changes involving diet changes, regular exercise and weight loss have been shown to reduce the rate of progression to type 2 diabetes. "
endocrine system,586,Which of the findings listed below is true of acromegaly?,A random growth hormone (GH) concentration may be diagnostically useful,Growth hormone concentrations are suppressed to normal by bromocriptine therapy,It is unusual for the pituitary fossa to be enlarged,Pituitary hormones other than growth hormone are rarely affected,The majority of patients demonstrate an abnormal glucose tolerance test (GTT),E,"Random GH concentrations are pretty useless in the diagnosis of acromegaly, which depends upon non-suppression of GH in the oral glucose tolerance test, in which approximately 50% also have either impaired GTT or diabetes. GH concentrations seldom suppress to normal with bromocriptine but often respond far better with octreotide. Usually at presentation the fossa is enlarged (about 80%). Prolactin is often elevated (30%) although hypopituitarism would be unusual unless the tumour is particularly large. "

Diabetes mellitus as an alternative diagnosis is ruled out by the normal glucose which we are given as part of the scenario. Whilst cranial diabetes insipidus (DI) is not impossible, it is less likely than nephrogenic DI in a patient taking chronic lithium therapy. Diuretic abuse and psychogenic polydypsia are ruled out by the fluid deprivation test. Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) results in water retention and hyponatraemia."
endocrine system,588,A 38-year-old man has had a liver biopsy as part of investigation for abnormal LFTs. The pathologist report states: special stains demonstrate the presence of a very large amount of iron pigment within the hepatocytes. What single condition is identified by the pathologists report?,Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency,Hemangioma,Hemochromatosis,Hemosiderosis,Wilson’s disease,C,In hemochromatosis distribution pattern of iron in liver biopsy by pearl’s stain is more prominent iron granules in periportal hepatocyte and relative sparing of kupffer cells and decreased intensity near the central vein. By contrast iron overload in hemosiderosis causes to accumulation of iron granules predominantly in kupffer cells and more in central area rather than peripheral hepatocyte.

endocrine system,594,"On routine screening of a 50-year-old woman who complained of tiredness, she is found to be hypercalcaemic. She is being treated for manic depression and cardiac failure. Which of the following is most likely to be the cause of the raised calcium?",ACE Inhibitor therapy,Furosemide therapy,Lithium therapy,Seroxat treatment,Vitamin D deficiency,C,Lithium can produce diabetes insipidus and also raise calcium. Neither Seroxat nor angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are related to hypercalcaemia. Excess of vitamin D causes elevated calcium. Furosemide lowers calcium but thiazides reduce excretion and so can exacerbate hypercalcaemia.

Which of the following is a likely feature on biochemistry testing?",Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypokalaemia,Increased bicarbonate,Increased pH,C,"The suspicion is that this woman has an underlying VIPoma. As such she is over-producing large quantities of small bowel secretions, leading to bicarbonate and potassium loss. This leads to a normal anion gap metabolic acidosis.  Decreased pH rather than increased pH occurs because it is small bowel secretions which increase in volume rather than stomach acid. Hyperkalaemia does not occur; serum bicarbonate is decreased due to bicarbonate loss. Hypernatraemia would only be seen in a state of severe dehydration. The family history should lead you to consider one of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes as a underlying cause."

Which of the following is the next appropriate investigation ?",Abdominal CT,Aldosterone / renin ratio,DMSA,Renal angiogram,Urinary electrolytes,B,"Hypokalaemia in the presence of ACE inhibition and thiazide use is highly suspicious of primary hyperaldosteronism. The incidence of primary aldosteronism is now thought to be much higher than previously considered, (up to 4-5% of patients with hypertension). The next investigation of choice is the aldosterone/renin ratio which will help differentiate between primary hyperaldosteronism and renovascular disease as possible causes. If renovascular disease is suspected, then angiography is a reasonable approach to investigation, but this may follow aldosterone/renin estimation. CT scanning is appropriate if an adrenal adenoma is suspected. DMSA has largely fallen out of favour and been replaced by either MRA or traditional angiography. Urinary electrolytes are of less value as an investigation as they may be confounded by factors such as use of diuretics."
endocrine system,601,A 39-year-old male presents with gynaecomastia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his gynaecomastia?,Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH),Hypopituitarism,Hypothyroidism,Prolactinoma,Seminoma,E,"Gynaecomastia is due to a perturbation in the testosterone to oestradiol ratio. Neither hyperprolactinaemia nor hypopituitarism disturb this ratio and are rarely associated with gynaecomastia. Unlike hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism is not a cause. CAH is not a cause. However, gynaecomastia may be a presenting symptom of a seminoma and may arise due to human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) secretion. Prolactinoma is a benign tumour of the pituitary gland which in the large majority of cases is asymptomatic."

Thisaccounts for the longer half life of HCG (24h) compared to say LH (2h)∙ Alpha chain similar to alpha chain of FSH, LH, TSH - therefore has some intrinsic TSH activity∙ Unique beta chain∙ All human tissues make HCG but the placenta is unique in being able to glycosylate it,increasing the half life and giving biological activity. Sialic acid residues are essential for thelonger half life∙ HGC is produced mainly by the syncytiotrophoblast although gene expression also occurs incytotrophoblasts∙ HCG is detectable in the 8 cell stage embryo and takes over from LH in supporting the corpusluteum about 8 days after ovulation (1 day after implantation)"
endocrine system,603,A 53-year-old woman comes to the clinic for review. She is obese and has a history of hypertension which is managed with ramipril and amlodipine. Her blood pressure is 155/85 mmHg. Her BMI is 29. Which of the following most accurately predicts her level of insulin resistance?,Blood pressure,BMI,HDL cholesterol,LDL cholesterol,Triglyceride / HDL ratio,E,The answer is triglyceride / HDL ratio. Cross-sectional studies across the Caucasian population have suggested that triglyceride/HDL ratio is most predictive of insulin resistance. As such TG/HDL can be used to stratify both future risk of the development of cardiovascular disease and future risk of diabetes mellitus. Weight loss and exercise training is seen to impact on TG/HDL ratio; pioglitazone and metformin which impact on insulin resistance both lead to modest increases in HDL and a decrease in triglycerides in some patients.
endocrine system,604,Alpha-glucosidase is deficient in which of the following disorders?,Andersen disease (glycogen storage disorder type 4),Cori's disease (glycogen storage disorder type 3),McArdle's disease (glycogen storage disorder type 5),Pompe's disease (glycogen storage disorder type 2),Glycogen storage disorder type 1,D,"Pompe's disease is a deficiency in alpha-glucosidase which can be treated with supplementation of the enzyme. It produces a myopathy and also restrictive cardiomyopathy and hepatomegaly. Some of the glycogen storage disorders can have muscle involvement. These include:  Pompe's disease or acid maltase deficiency Cori's/Forbes' disease or amylo-1-6- glucosidase deficiency, and McArdle's disease or myophosphorylase deficiency.  Andersen disease is a deficiency of amylo-1,4-1,6 transglucosidase. Glycogen storage disorder type 1, formally known as Von Gierke's disease, is a deficiency of glucose 6 phosphorylase. "

However, the eldest son has recently been investigatedby the neurology department for slightly erratic behavior and fidgety restless movements of both legs. Based on the likely clinical diagnosis, which one of the following genetic patterns is most likely?",AD inheritance with anticipation,AD with variable penetrance,AR,X-linked,Mitochondrial disorder,A,"Patient is suffering from Huntingtons disease and that is autosomal dominant with anticipation which means a genetic disorder is passed on to the next generation, the symptoms of the genetic disorder become apparent at an earlier age with each generation"
endocrine system,606,"A 25-year-old woman presents to the endocrine clinic with recurrent episodes of collapse. During one of these episodes she is found to have hypoglycaemia with a venous blood glucose of 2.0 mmol/L, coupled with raised insulin and C peptide. Sulphonylurea screen is negative. Which of the following other pathologies is most likely to be found?",Medullary thyroid carcinoma,Neuromas,Parathyroid hyperplasia or adenomas,Phaeochromocytoma,Prolactinoma,C,"This patient has an insulinoma, which should lead you to suspect she has multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. This is the combination of parathyroid hyperplasia or adenoma, pancreatic endocrine tumours, and pituitary adenoma. The genetic abnormality is in a proto-oncogene on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13), and is autosomal dominant with a high degree of penetrance. Hyperparathyroidism is the presenting feature in 80% of patients with MEN-1. Pancreatic endocrine tumours are present in 70%, of which 60% are gastrinomas and 30% are insulinomas. 30% of patients have a pituitary prolactinoma diagnosed during life, but they are found in closer to 50% at post-mortem. The association of medullary cell carcinoma of the thyroid and phaeochromocytoma is the basis of MEN-2, which has two variants. The genetic defect is within a tumour suppressor gene on chromosome 10q11.2. MEN-2a is also known as Sipple's syndrome, and in addition to medullary cell carcinoma and phaeochromocytoma, there may also be parathyroid hyperplasia and nephrolithiasis. MEN-2b has the characteristic features of mucosal neuromas and a phenotype resembling Marfan's syndrome. A third variant, which is familial medullary cell carcinoma in isolation, is also recognised.

Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome leads to multiple hormone deficiencies, including Addison's, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. Whilst neurofibromatosis is a cause of café au lait spots, it is not usually a cause of precocious puberty and other endocrine abnormalities such as the thyrotoxicosis seen here. Osteomalacia can occur as a consequence of McCune-Albright, but is not the primary diagnosis seen here."

This patient does not fit the Conn's phenotype, and the potassium of 4.8 is also high for a patient with aldosterone excess. Given the cortisol is only just above the lower limit of detectability, all of the options for Cushing's are incorrect. "
endocrine system,611,A 17-year-old female is referred following a visit to the dentist where marked erosion of her teeth was noted.

This suggests a diagnosis of bulimia which may cause a mild hypocalcaemia. Alkaline phosphatase is often raised, due to bone loss resulting from nutritional deficiencies. Hypoparathyroidism is a possible answer as tooth erosion and the like is typical of primary hypoparathyroidism, but the alkaline phosphatase would be expected to be normal/low with this condition. Conn's is unlikely in this age group, is not associated with tooth erosion and hypertension would be expected. Laxative abuse would be associated with hypokalaemia but the hypocalcaemia with raised alkaline phosphatase would not be expected. Early pregnancy would not fit this picture."

Which single diagnosis would explain this patient's illness?,Addison's disease,Antiphospholipid syndrome,Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome (Schmidt's disease),Pituitary infarction,Protein S deficiency,B,"With a history of recurrent DVT and confirmed hypoadrenalism, this patient is likely to have antiphospholipid syndrome. Antiphospholipid syndrome is a primary diagnosis or may co-exist with systemic lupus erythematosus. In this case, it is likely to have caused adrenal infarcts which have resulted in hypoadrenalism. Anticardiolipin antibodies or lupus anticoagulant may be present. It is associated with arterial and venous thrombosis and has a predilection for the adrenal veins causing adrenal infarction with consequent hypoadrenalism. Addison's disease is an autoimmune phenomenon and is not associated with DVT. The pigmentation, which is due to increased adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in hypoadrenalism, would exclude pituitary infarction as the cause of the hypoadrenalism. Hypoadrenalism is not associated with protein S deficiency. Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome is associated with:  hypothyroidism type 1 diabetes, and Addison's disease.  "

We know that there is no learning difficulties, and we are told that physical examination is normal and sense of smell would usually not be tested. Consequently a diagnosis of Kallman's is suggested. We are not told of a family history of growth delay, thus this is unlikely to be constitutional delay.

Investigations revealed:    LH concentration 1.0 U/L (1-10)   FSH concentration 1.0 U/L (1-7)   Serum testosterone 3.0 pmol/L (9-35)   Free T4 19 pmol/L (10-22)   TSH 3.0 mU/L (0.4-5)    CT scan reported as normal. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Constitutional delay of puberty,Kallmann's syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Noonan's syndrome,Prader-Willi syndrome,B,"The combination of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and anosmia would suggest a diagnosis of Kallmann's syndrome. This is one of the commonest causes of isolated hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism and is due to a failure of migration of the olfactory neurones and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRh) neurones during development. Klinefelter's syndrome is the karyotype 47XXY and associated with infertility, gynaecomastia and tall stature.  Noonan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder associated with multiple structural abnormalities such as neck webbing, craniofacial problems and cardiac issues.  Prader-Willi syndrome is a genetic condition leading to learning difficulties, impaired muscle tone and behavioural problems."
endocrine system,630,"A 35 year-old woman presented with a five year history of weight gain associated with a one year history of amenorrhoea. Over this time she had also noticed hirsutism and had been trying to conceive. On examination, she had a BMI of 32 kg/m^2, a pulse was 84 beats per minute, and a blood pressure of 154/100 mmHg. Features suggestive of Cushing's syndrome were also noted. Which of the following would be the most useful initial investigation?",24 hour urinary free cortisol (UFC) concentration,Combined 9 am ACTH concentration and serum cortisol concentration,Midnight cortisol concentration,Serum sodium and potassium concentrations,The 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (ODST),A,"Of 1 mg ODST or UFC, either test would be appropriate, but UFC is often recommended and has a 95% specificity (85% specificity in the obese) and a 98% sensitivity. It is however important to recognise that these values for specificity and sensitivity only apply to a high threshold for abnormal urinary free cortisol, set at 3-4 times the upper limit of the normal range. A number of patients with Cushings may therefore not fulfil the criteria for diagnosis of Cushings based on UFC alone. The ODST has a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 75-80% in obese subjects with a cut-off value of 50 nmol/L. Therefore, purely for convenience sake, a UFC would probably be the expected response here. Midnight cortisol is pointless as a screening test expecting the patient to be fast asleep when blood is taken. Sodium and potassium concentrations offer nothing, nor do ACTH and cortisol."
endocrine system,631,A 55-year-old obese man with type 2 diabetes mellitus is uncontrolled on diet alone. Which antidiabetic therapy would increase insulin sensitivity in this patient?,Acarbose,Gliclazide,Glimepiride,Pioglitazone,Repaglinide,D,"Type 2 diabetes is due to two defects: insulin resistance and insulin deficiency. In 95% of patients it is insulin resistance that is the main cause of the diabetes. These patients are typically obese with features of the metabolic syndrome. The bulk of the insulin resistance appears to be in skeletal muscle. The state of insulin resistance is associated with abnormal glucose metabolism and excessive free fatty acids in the blood. Drugs and lifestyle modifications that increase insulin sensitivity (and thereby reduce insulin resistance) help to reverse these abnormalities. Of the drugs listed only pioglitazone would boost insulin sensitivity. Metformin also boosts insulin sensitivity, but pioglitazone has more effect on peripheral insulin resistance. Pioglitazone, a PPAR gamma agonist, is an insulin sensitiser. It upregulates genes for enzymes which deal with the metabolism of free fatty acids. These lead to increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, and improve glucose uptake. It also leads to fluid retention in around 10% of patients, is contraindicated in cardiac failure, and leads to a reduction in bone mineral density. It reduces HbA1c by between 1 and 1.3%. Gliclazide, glimepiride and repaglinide are insulin secretagogues; they boost insulin secretion. Acarbose has a modest effect on the absorption of sugars from the gut, but its main effect is to cause flatulence."
endocrine system,632,Which tissues produce oxytocin?,The hypothalamus only,"The hypothalamus, ovary and testis",The posterior pituitary gland only,The posterior pituitary gland and the ovary only,The hypothalamus and the ovary only,B,"OXYTOCIN• Polypeptide hormone, 9 amino acids, produced mainly by the para-ventricular nucleus of thehypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary. Also produced locally in the ovary and testis• Differs from ADH (arginine vasopressine) in only 2 amino acids• Circulate largely unbound in plasma• Kidneys, liver and brain are the main sites of clearance• Half life ~1 min• Secreted episodically by calcium-dependent exocytosis• Basal concentrations are similar in males and females• Oestrogen increases the sensitivity of the myometrium to oxytocin, while progesteronedecreases sensitivity"
endocrine system,633,Which tumour marker has the highest specificity when used appropriately?,AFP,Bence Jones protein,CA 19-9,CA 125,LDH,B,"Tumour markers ideally need to be both sensitive and specific. Sensitivity: the ability of a test positively to identify people who have the disease, that is, not missing cases and avoiding false negatives. Specificity: the ability of a test to give a normal result to people who do not have the disease, that is, appropriately reassuring unaffected patients and avoiding false positives. In practice, no tumour marker is perfect and false positives and negatives can always occur. However, some perform better than others. Bence Jones protein is specific for myeloma, false positives are rare, and therefore it is more specific than the other markers. In monitoring of myeloma blood samples for paraprotein detection as well as for free light chains are done.  AFP is elevated in hepatocellular carcinoma and in teratomas but false positive results occur with non-malignant liver disease. CA125 is used to identify patients with ovarian cancer but false positives occur due to ascites, other abdominal malignancies, endometriosis, and pelvic inflammatory diseases. CA 19-9 is elevated in patients with pancreatic and colorectal carcinomas but is also elevated in obstructive jaundice, cholangitis, and cholestasis. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a very non-specific marker but can be elevated in some haematological malignancies."
endocrine system,634,"A 78-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis is brought to the medical admissions unit with confusion. She can give no useful history. There is a swollen right knee, and a temperature of 38.6°C. A blood sugar reading records 24.8 mmol/L. Which of the following statements in relation to her condition is correct?",Insulin inhibits ketogenesis,Mortality risk is low,The patient is likely to be hypo-osmolar,There is osmotic shift to the extravascular space,Urine dipstick reveals reduced specific gravity,A,"The diagnosis in this patient is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS). In general, there is enough insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes to suppress ketogenesis, but insufficient to prevent hyperglycaemia and the hepatic resistance to glucagon. The risk of mortality in HHS is 10-20%, with a strong predilection to thrombotic events. In general, HHS results in osmotic fluid shift to the intravascular space. Urinalysis reveals increased specific gravity denoting dehydration."
endocrine system,635,Which of the following is a characteristic feature of acute intermittent porphyria?,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Excessive faecal protoporphyrin excretion,Excessive urinary porphobilinogen during an acute attack,Hypernatraemia during attacks,Photosensitivity,C,"Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) causes the classic acute attacks of porphyria, with abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is caused by reduced hepatic porphobilinogen deaminase activity, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. This leads to increased urinary porphobilinogen and aminolaevulinic acid, especially during attacks. The urine classically turns deep red on standing. Hyponatraemia is often present during acute attacks and may, in part, be due to inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Episodes of porphyria are more common in females, possibly due to the effects of oestrogens, and the onset is usually in adolescence. Attacks are characterised by motor polyneuropathy, hypertension, tachycardia, and abdominal pain associated with vomiting and constipation. Tubulointerstitial nephritis may be present. There is no photosensitivity or rash. Attacks may be precipitated by drugs (including alcohol, benzodiazepines, rifampicin, oral contraceptives, phenytoin, and sulphonamides), stress, pregnancy, premenstruation, infection, and fasting. Treatment is usually supportive, with high carbohydrate supplementation and withdrawal of precipitating factors. Daily haem arginate infusions can be given for 3-4 days. Faecal protoporphyrin is raised in protoporphyria and variegate protoporphyria, but normal in AIP."
endocrine system,636,What is the primary endogenous mineralocorticoid?,Pregnenolone,Fludrocortisone,Aldosterone,Progesterone,Cortisol,C,"is the primary endogenous mineralocorticoid and is thought to account for over 90% of mineralocortocoid activity in humans.

Treatment with other forms of steroid lead to decreased levels of cortisol due to negative feedback."
endocrine system,639,"A 62 year old with type 2 diabetes mellitus complains of dizziness on standing up.  He also complains of diarrhoea, vomiting and impotence.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Hypoglycaemia,Peripheral neuropathy,Autonomic neuropathy,Medication related,Inflammatory bowel disease,C,"This patient presents with autonomic neuropathy as postural hypotension, impotence and diarrhoea and vomiting are ll features of this.  Peripheral neuropathy would lead to sensory symptoms and the other options are less likely to lead to all of the symptoms evident."
endocrine system,640,"A 56-year-old male presents with a five year history of increased sweats and change in shoe size. Examination reveals prognathism and macroglossia, with large hands. Blood pressure is 180/94 mmHg and visual field examination is full to confrontation. Which of the following tests would be diagnostic?",IGF-1 concentration ,Insulin tolerance test ,Oral glucose tolerance test ,Pituitary MRI ,TRH test ,A,The diagnosis of acromegaly used to be confirmed with a failure of growth hormone (GH) suppression during an oral glucose tolerance test (i.e. if the GH remains more than 2 mU/L despite 75 g of oral glucose). This test is largely outdated and many centres don't use it. The investigation of choice in most centres is serum IGF-1 monitoring. Though a pituitary adenoma may be present it is not diagnostic of acromegaly. 
endocrine system,641,"A 72-year-old male presents with a two month history of weight loss and weakness. He says that his symptoms started with a severe pain, affecting lower back and anterior thighs. It had a burning quality and was worse at night. Examination reveals a BMI of 24.5 kg/m^2 and a blood pressure of 146/90 mmHg. Examination of the lower limbs reveals a bilateral weakness of knee extension. He is unable to rise from the squatting position. There is absence of the knee reflex but the ankle reflexes are preserved and both plantars are flexor. There are no abnormalities on sensory examination. Which of the following tests may be diagnostic?",Oral glucose tolerance test,Thyroid function test,Urine free cortisol concentration,Vitamin B12 concentration,Vitamin D concentration,A,"This patient has a number of features of diabetic amyotrophy, which usually presents with a painful asymmetrical proximal motor neuropathy of the lower limbs (although it can be bilateral). It initially presents with pain in the thigh, which progresses to proximal muscle wasting, loss of knee reflexes and tender proximal muscles. The plantars can become extensor, but this is unusual. Diabetic amyotrophy is thought to be caused by the occlusion of the vasa nervorum of the proximal lumbar plexus and/or femoral nerve. It is often associated with poor diabetic control, and may improve with good control (although it often self-resolves with time). Osteomalacia, hyperthyroidism and Cushing's would be unlikely as the proximal myopathy involves quadriceps and hamstrings and knee reflexes would be preserved. Pain is usually not a predominant feature. Vitamin B12 deficiency tends to initially cause peripheral neuropathy, with loss of vibration sense and position followed by areflexia and weakness. This then develops into spasticity, Babinski plantars and ataxia if left untreated. "
endocrine system,642,A 62-year-old female with a six year history of type 2 diabetes attends for annual review. Her HbA1c is 86 mmol/mol (20-42). Into what average plasma glucose concentration does her HbA1c translate?,7.5 mmol/L,10 mmol/L,13.5 mmol/L,15.5 mmol/L,19 mmol/L,C,"The HbA1c is an important reflection of control over a three month period (life expectancy of the erythrocyte). There is a good relationship between the rise in glucose and its ability to glycosylate the Hb molecule (there is a difference between average plasma glucose and blood glucose). Thus a HbA1c of 53 mmol/mol would translate into an average plasma (higher than value of blood glucose) glucose of 9.5 mmol/L and a HbA1c of 86 mmol/mol into 13.41 mmol/L. This is the reason why so much emphasis is placed on controlling HbA1c rather than the specific glucose measurements, as these vary so much throughout the day. This is a difficult question and it is very unlikely that you would be asked to translate average blood glucose into an exact HbA1c figure without being provided with a conversion calculator; however, the learning point here is that you realise that the numerical values are not the same.

endocrine system,643,"A 58-year-old woman is admitted with a collapse and palpitations, having passed out in front of her husband whilst coming out of the bathroom. She has a history of severe diarrhoea over the past few days. Medical history of note includes ketoconazole for a fungal infection, and bendroflumethiazide for hypertension. On examination her BP is 100/60 mmHg, her pulse is 80. She looks dehydrated. Whilst you are watching her monitor she feels unwell again and you notice a run of torsades de pointes VT. Which of the following electrolyte abnormalities is most likely to be contributing to her risk of VT?",Hyperkalaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hyperuricaemia,Hypocalcaemia,Hypomagnesaemia,E,"This woman is taking ketoconazole, which is known to lead to possible QT prolongation and increase the risk of torsades de pointes VT. Additionally, she has been suffering from severe diarrhoea which will lead to GI magnesium loss, and is taking bendroflumethiazide which in itself contributes to low magnesium levels. She should have her magnesium levels measured early, and be considered for IV magnesium supplementation if she is found to be hypomagnesaemic. Of course it is also vitally important to stop her ketoconazole. Hypocalcaemia can cause a long QT. However, clinically significant hypocalcaemia resulting from diarrhoea is less common than seeing hypomagnesaemia. This lady also takes bendroflumethiazide which may further contribute to low magnesium, making this the most likely answer in this case."
endocrine system,644,A 35-year-old female is found to have a solitary mass on the chest x ray. Biopsy confirms this to be a carcinoid tumour of the lung. Which of the following are likely to be associated with this lesion?,Carcinoid syndrome,Cushing's syndrome,Hyponatraemia,Pellagra,Pulmonary hypertension,B,"Classical carcinoid syndrome occurs in less than 10% of patients with carcinoid tumours, but occurs most commonly in those with tumours of the small intestine, appendix, and proximal small bowel. Those in the lung rarely cause carcinoid, but have been associated with ACTH secretion and subsequent Cushing's syndrome. Other associated conditions where foregut carcinoid tumours are found in the pancreas are associated with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and VIPoma. A bronchial carcinoid tumour has rarely been reported in association with acromegaly (ectopic growth hormone-releasing hormone [GHRH]). They may also be found in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 where pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours predominate."
endocrine system,645,"A 37-year-old woman is trying for a child with her new partner. She is very concerned as she has had no menstrual periods for the past seven months, but serial pregnancy tests have proved negative. If she has entered the menopause then which of the following blood tests would fit most with this picture?",Elevated FSH,Elevated oestradiol,Low LH,Low LHRH,Low testosterone,A,"Ovarian failure is most likely to be associated with elevated FSH, but levels can vary and should be repeated over four to eight weeks. FSH levels above 30 IU/L are generally considered post menopausal. Levels above 12 are considered raised in a woman still having periods. Testosterone levels vary in women and are increased in women who are overweight because of peripheral conversion to androgens in fat, and in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome. Low luteinising hormone (LH) is not consistent with the menopause, nor is low luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH), as sex hormone releasing hormones would be elevated in an attempt to drive LH and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) release. Elevated oestradiol is not associated with ovarian failure."

endocrine system,650,Conn's syndrome is the result of what?,Cortisol deficiency,Aldosterone deficiency,Cortisol hypersecretion,Pregnenolone deficiency,Aldosterone hypersecretion,E,Remember Conn's is a condition of raised Aldosterone (with subsequent effects on the aldosterone-renin-angiotensin system). Catecholamines and cortisol tests are not useful in diagnosing this. Conn's Syndrome Conn's Syndrome results from primary hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium ions (and subsequently water) in exchange for potassium in the kidney. The result is increased blood volume and therefore increased blood pressure. Hypokalaemia may be present but is often within normal range.The main causes of primary hyperaldosteronism are adrenal hyperplasia (65%) and adrenal adenoma (30-35%). Note some texts refer to primary aldosteronism as Conn's. Strictly speaking Conn's is primary aldosteronism due to adrenal adenomaSecondary hyperaldosteronism is due to increased renin production in conditions such as renal artery stenosis or a renin producing tumour.

Quite marked hypokalaemia, even in the presence of ACE inhibition, is a further pointer to the diagnosis. MRI abdomen is the investigation that is likely to confirm the possibility of an adrenal adenoma. Whilst addition of further anti-hypertensives may drive his blood pressure closer to goal they are unlikely to be effective and surgery is the most appropriate intervention.

Other features include macroglossia, headaches, visual field defects, excessive sweating, carpal tunnel syndrome and hypertension and impaired glucose tolerance.  Galactorrhoea can also occur. In growth hormone there will be an elevated IGF1 and the diagnosis is confirmed when growth hormone is not suppressed with glucose tolerance test. Panhypopituitarism can occur due to compression and the other hormones should be measured.  An MRI may locate the pituitary adenoma which results in acromegaly. There is an excessive risk of colorectal cancer in acromegaly and therefore colonoscopy should be offered. Transphenoidal surgery is the treatment of choice. Somatostatin analogues such as octreotide, can be used for medical management and have overtaken dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine and cabergoline.  Pegvisomant is a human growth hormone analogue and is a highly selective antagonist. It is utilised in those who have inadequate response to surgery or other medical treatments."
endocrine system,662,A 33-year-old woman with an 18 year history of type I diabetes mellitus presents with proteinuria. She is a smoker of 20 cigarettes daily. Examination reveals a blood pressure of 155/95 mmHg. Investigations reveal:    Serum cholesterol 7.6 mmol/L (less than5.2)   HbA1c 67 mmol/mol (20-42)   24 hour urinary protein excretion 1. 5 g (less than0.2)    Which intervention is most likely to retard the development of renal failure?,Bendroflumethiazide,Improve glycaemic control with HbA1c less than 53 mmol/mol,Lisinopril,Simvastatin,Stop smoking,C,"This patient has diabetic nephropathy with marked proteinuria. To attenuate the progression towards end stage renal disease, stringent blood pressure control should be employed maintaining a BP less than 130/80 mmHg and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor would probably offer even greater reno-protection than any other anti-hypertensive. Simvastatin has no proven benefit on renal disease and improved glycaemic control although of benefit would be of less benefit than BP control (UKPDS/DCCT trials). Again stopping smoking would probably be of greatest benefit to her with regard to reducing cardiovascular risk but would not itself offer any reno-protective effect."
endocrine system,663,A 32-year-old lady presented with episodes of polydipsia and polyuria for the last six months.

Parathyroid hormone has a number of direct effects:  it enhances the release of calcium from bones by binding to osteoblasts which stimulates the formation of osteoclasts, and it enhances reabsorption of calcium in the distal tubules."
endocrine system,664,"A 29-year-old woman with a history of type 1 diabetes comes to the endocrine clinic for review. She is very concerned as she has begun to lose significant amounts of hair from a patch on her scalp over the course of the last few months. On examination, she has a circular area of hair loss with an area of normal looking skin in the middle of it. Skin scrapings taken by the GP have not produced any growth. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Griseofulvin,Intra-lesional triamcinolone,Oral ciclosporin,Topical clotrimazole,Topical hydrocortisone,B,"The non-scarring and circular nature of the hair loss is typical of alopecia, which occurs with increasing frequency in patients suffering from other autoimmune disorders. Intralesional corticosteroids are the initial management of choice in patients with limited disease. Griseofulvin and topical clotrimazole are both anti-fungals. With a negative culture specimen and the lack of scarring this is highly unlikely to be due to fungal infection. Topical hydrocortisone is likely to be ineffective in managing alopecia, and systemic treatment with oral ciclosporin is usually an option when disease is more extensive."
endocrine system,665,Which physiological mechanism controls water loss (aquaresis) without loss of sodium (natriuresis)?,Arginine vasopressin,Atrial natriuretic peptides,Renal glomerular filtration rate,Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS),Thirst,A,"Disorders of sodium concentrations are closely linked with water homeostasis. When sodium is excreted, water usually follows, such as occurs with diuretic therapy and natriuretic peptides. When sodium is retained, water will also be retained by the kidneys. This is seen in prolonged activation of the RAAS in heart failure where there is increased total body water and total body sodium. The only hormone system which can disrupt this is the arginine vasopressin (AVP) system, also known as anti-diuretic hormone. AVP maintains a close control of water homeostasis by the use of a water channel called aquaporin. AVP, travelling in the blood stream stimulates:  short term release of pre-formed aquaporin which is incorporated into the collecting duct basement cell membrane, and transcription and translation to make more aquaporin, on a longer-term basis.  Aquaporin is a very specialised channel protein with a very tight lumen, which allows only water through. Water from the lumen of the collecting duct enters the aquaporin allowing concentration of the urine and conservation of water which re-enters body cells. Sodium and other ions cannot get through the aquaporin channels. Disorders of AVP include:  SIADH - syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH levels are high causing conservation of water without conservation of sodium. This causes hyponatraemia with inappropriately high loss of sodium in the urine. Diabetes insipidus - inadequate ADH leads to conservation of sodium and loss of water. Patients become hyperosmolar and hypernatraemic with polyuria and polydipsia."

GLP-1 is a hormone released by the gut in response to food intake that acts on the pancreatic beta cells to trigger insulin secretion. There is an association, albeit uncommon, between exenatide and severe pancreatitis. Patients being started on exenatide should be counselled about the symptoms of pancreatitis and the diagnosis should be suspected in all individuals on the drug who present with abdominal pain. Pancreatitis is less commonly associated with sitagliptin and not with the other medications listed here.

The most likely cause is lithium. Chlorpropamide causes a SIADH as does carbamazepine and fluoxetine. Furosemide is another possibility but if it had dried the patient out the plasma sodium would be expected to be higher. It is most likely that the patient has started lithium for a psychiatric disorder. A 46-year-old man would be unlikely to be receiving high doses of furosemide."

endocrine system,678,"A 42-year-old male presents with tiredness and central weight gain, two years after having undergone pituitary surgery for a non-functional pituitary tumour. He has otherwise recovered from his pituitary surgery well, has been found to have complete anterior hypopituitarism and is receiving stable replacement therapy with testosterone monthly injections, thyroxine, and hydrocortisone. On examination there are no specific abnormalities, his vision is 6/9 in both eyes and he has no visual field defects. From his notes you see that he has gained 8 kg in weight over the last six months and his BMI is 31 kg/m^2. His blood pressure is 122/72 mmHg. Thyroid function tests and testosterone concentrations have been normal. A post-operative MRI scan report shows that the pituitary tumour has been adequately cleared with no residual tissue. Which of the following is the likely cause of his current symptoms?",Aldosterone deficiency,Depression,DDAVP deficiency,Growth hormone deficiency,Somatisation disorder,D,"This patient presents with deteriorating tiredness and weight gain after having had pituitary surgery for a non-functioning pituitary tumour. He has associated anterior hypopituitarism but is receiving appropriate and stable replacement therapy. However, these symptoms are typical of an untreated adult growth hormone deficiency and reductions in quality of life, reduced energy and detrimental changes in body composition are well recognised. Recent evidence would suggest that growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy in addition to his current replacement therapy does improve symptoms and quality of life and is endorsed by NICE guidance on Growth hormone deficiency (adults) - human growth hormone (TA64). The renin-aldosterone system is independent of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis and therefore aldosterone is not necessary. The patient does not have any symptoms of thirst or polyuria and therefore vasopressin deficiency is also an unlikely cause of his problems. Whilst depression or somatisation are possibilities it is important to recognise that the symptoms of tiredness and the weight gain are more in keeping with GH deficiency and no other features of either of the former diagnoses are suggested."
endocrine system,679,A 44-year-old female presents with features suggestive of Cushing's syndrome. Initial investigations reveal a 24 hour urine free cortisol concentration of 350 nmol/day (less than250). Which is the most appropriate investigation of this patient's suspected Cushing's syndrome?,9 am and midnight cortisol,ACTH concentration,Dexamethasone suppression tests,Glucose tolerance test,Short Synacthen test,C,This patient is clinically suspected to have Cushing's syndrome with the diagnosis being supported by elevated urine free cortisol concentrations. The dexamethasone suppression test can add information by helping to differentiate some of the causes of hypercortisolism. If cortisol is not suppressed by the low or high dose dexamethasone suppression test then either primary adrenal Cushing's syndrome (low/undetectable ACTH) or ectopic ACTH is the cause (high ACTH). If cortisol is not suppressed by low dose dexamethasone but is by high dose then Cushing's disease is the likely cause. 9 am and midnight cortisol concentrations would not add much to the suspicion of hypercortisolism which is provided by the urine free cortisol. Short Synacthen tests are used to assess for hypoadrenalism. Glucose tolerance test is used in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus and acromegaly.

She is likely to have type 2 diabetes given the BMI with uncontrolled hyperglycaemia but does not have diabetic ketoacidosis because the urine is negative for ketones, so would not require fixed rate insulin infusion. It is important that her glycaemia is controlled to promote recovery from the sepsis. This is best achieved with intravenous insulin initially.    "
endocrine system,681,"A 57-year-old man attends the outpatient clinic. He was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes seven years ago following an acute myocardial infarction at 50 years of age. His diabetic control has been deteriorating, with blood glucose readings of 9-12 at home, despite following a diet and taking regular exercise. More recently, in an effort to improve control he has been commenced on pioglitazone. His current treatment is metformin 850 tds, pioglitazone 30 mg, aspirin 75 mg/day, carvedilol 12.5 mg bd, ramipril 10 mg od, furosemide 80 mg daily, simvastatin 40 mg/day. On examination he is overweight with a BMI of 29, his blood pressure is 128/74 mmHg with pulse rate of 63 min^-1. He has no heart murmurs and there is some pitting oedema in the lower limbs. Auscultation reveals a clear chest with no evidence of pulmonary oedema. He is obese with no organomegaly. His ECG shows sinus rhythm with poor r wave progression. His HbA1c checked in the clinic is 69 mmol/mol (20-42). Which of the following is the most appropriate management strategy for this patient?",Add gliclazide 80 mg bd,Increase pioglitazone to 45 mg daily,Stop metformin and use Competact (combination of pioglitazone and metformin),Substitute pioglitazone with gliclazide 80 mg bd,Substitute pioglitazone with acarbose,D,"This patient is likely to be insulin resistant; however there is evidence of heart failure and fluid overload, so use of pioglitazone would be contraindicated. These drugs promote fluid retention by means of an action on the collecting ducts of the kidney so promoting sodium and water retention. The only appropriate action therefore is to stop pioglitazone, substituting this with the insulin secretagogue gliclazide which will hopefully improve his glycaemic control."

Which one of the following would most likely be present in this patient?",Anti-thyroglobulin antibody ,Thyroid microsomal antibodies,Thyroid peroxidase antibodies,TSH receptor inhibiting antibodies,TSH receptor stimulating antibodies ,E,This patient is most likely to have Graves' disease as revealed by the thyroid bruit. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor stimulating antibody is specific for Graves' disease and is present in the vast majority of cases.
endocrine system,693,Aldosterone promotes water retention via which of the following mechanisms?,Stimulation of Potassium resorption in the tubular lumen,Up-regulation of Aquaporin protein channels in the collecting duct,Down-regulation of urea transport channels in the collecting duct,Up-regulation of urea transport proteins in the collecting duct,Up-regulation of the sodium/potassium pumps in the distal tubule and collecting duct,E,Aldosterone stimulates Sodium resorption in the kidney via the mechanisms described below. Up-regulation of Aquaporin and Urea Transport proteins are mechanisms of water retention stimulated by Vasopressin (ADH). Aldosterone Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid steroid hormone produced in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone should be thought of as a renal sodium (Na) regulator. It stimulates retention of water via the followingUpregulates Na/K pumps in the DCT and Collecting ducts of the kidney nephrons resulting in Na reabsorption in exchange for potassium ionloss (water follows sodium via osmotic gradient) Upregulates epithelial Sodium channels (ENaCs) resulting in increased sodium reabsorption (ADH also stimulates ENaCs) Also has a role in H+/K+ ion exchange thus regulating acid/base balanceStimulationThere are a number of pathways that stimulate AldosteroneJuxtaglomerular cells of the kidney release Renin which stimulates Aldosterone via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis Raised potassium directly stimulates Aldosterone There are several other minor modulators of Aldosterone such as ACTH and steroid hormones.NOTEADH also promotes water retention but its mechanisms of achieving this are different to those of aldosterone.

Depression is a common cause of lethargy in the elderly; however other causes should be excluded. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause lethargy and anaemia. However, other features in this scenario cannot be explained. Occult malignancy is another cause of anaemia. However, weight loss and gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding are important features and change in character is rarely a feature."

NICE has therefore released guidelines regarding the use of metformin in patients with renal impairment. Clinical circumstances should be reviewed when the eGFR falls below 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (or the serum creatinine exceeds 130 µmol/L). metformin should then be stopped if the serum creatinine exceeds 150 µmol/L (or eGFR is below 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2).  Metformin may be continued (or initiated) with an eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2, but renal function should be monitored closely (every 3-6 months). The dose of metformin should be reviewed and reduced in those with an eGFR of less than 45 mL/min/1.73 m^2, and renal function should be monitored every three months. Metformin should not be initiated in patients as this stage however. The drug should be stopped once eGFR falls to less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2 (creatinine more than 150 µmol/L). Caution should be taken in patients with anticipated significant fluctuations in renal function, or those at risk of abrupt deterioration in function (based on history, comorbitities, proteinuria and other medications). In this case the eGFR is more than 30 mL/min/1.73 m^2, and the creatinine is less than 150 µmol/L, therefore metformin can be continued (albeit at a reduced dose). Further review of her medication is likely to be needed due to her raised HbA1c, however this is not what the question asks. "
endocrine system,702,"A 25-year-old woman presents to the endocrine clinic for review. She has not had a period for four months. Her periods are usually irregular and often heavy. A recent pregnancy test has proved negative. On examination her BP is 149/90 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular. Her BMI is 31 kg/m^2. She has facial acne and hirsutism including over the upper chest. The GP has checked some routine bloods and has found the testosterone to be 4.8 nmol/L. Which of the following is the most useful investigation?",24-hour urinary free cortisol,ACTH,Fasting blood glucose,LH/FSH ratio,TSH,D,"Given the clinical picture described here the suspicion is of PCOS. The cut-off point for suspicion of an underlying adrenal tumour or CAH is a total testosterone greater than5 nmol/L. The most appropriate next step is to check the LH/FSH ratio which is expected to be greater than2. Trans-vaginal USS is likely to confirm the presence of polycystic ovaries. Cushing's disease related to elevated ACTH is usually not associated with significant virilisation. Fasting blood glucose may be useful as PCOS is associated with impaired glucose tolerance, although it is not a primary investigation for confirming the diagnosis. Hyperthyroidism is a cause of amenorrhoea, although there are no symptoms of hyperthyroidism here. 24-hour urinary free cortisol is useful as an initial screening test for Cushing's syndrome."
endocrine system,703,A 17 year old female attends with primary amenorrhoea. She has severe acne and a deep voice and has an enlarged clitoris. Her male cousin had precocious puberty. Which of the following should be performed to confirm the diagnosis?,Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone,Testoterone levels,Pelvic Ultrasound,Steroid hormone binding globulin,FSH and LH,A,"This patient most likely has congenital adrenal hyperplasia. This most often due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency and leads to cortisol deficiency, with or without aldosterone deficiency and androgen excess. There is classic and mild/non classic forms. In females in the classic form there is ambigious genatalia and in males this often presents later with salt losing form (dehydration, hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia) or non salt form with early virilisation. In the mild forms there is no adrenal or cortisol insufficiency but hyperandrogenism. In boys this presents as precocious puberty and in females with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea and virilisation. The clue in this question is the family history. An elevated Serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone confirms the diagnosis."

On examination her BP is 145/90 mmHg, pulse is 82 bpm and regular. She has male pattern hirsutism and acne over the face and upper chest. Her BMI is 33 kg/m^2. Routine bloods are normal and include a fasting blood glucose which is 5.8 mmol/L. Which of the following is the optimal intervention for this patient?",Clomifene,Metformin,Pioglitazone,Pulsed gonadotropins,Weight loss,E,"Although a number of agents can be used to improve ovulation in women with PCOS, NICE guidelines from 2013 recommend weight loss as the most important initial step. Given this patient is obese with a BMI of 33 kg/m^2, and has a fasting plasma glucose at the upper end of the normal range, loss in weight is likely to improve both the outcomes in any pregnancy and reduce future risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Both clomifene and metformin can be used for inducing ovulation in patients with PCOS. Metformin may lead to modest weight loss. Studies have shown that their effects are similar in monotherapy and there appears to be no advantage in combination therapy. Pioglitazone is rarely used in the treatment of PCOS because of its side effect profile (weight gain, loss of BMD, fluid retention). Gonadotropin therapy is usually reserved for patients who are resistant to therapy with clomifene. "

It occurs because of a decrease in conversion from carotene to vitamin A. The consumption of vitamin A in hypothyroidism is also decreased. Anorexia nervosa is associated with hypercarotenaemia but does not fit here with the history of weight gain and elevated BMI. Diabetes mellitus is also associated with hypercarotenaemia, but the sodium at the lower end of normal is a better pointer towards hypothyroidism as the alternative diagnosis. Dietary carotene excess is unlikely, and occurs more frequently in children. The only mildly raised bilirubin makes chronic liver disease unlikely. Hyperbilirubinaemia is not normally detectable clinically as jaundice until the level is more than 40 µmol/L. In hypothyroidism, the activity of bilirubin UDP-glucuronyltransferase is decreased, resulting in a reduction in bilirubin excretion. This would account for the slightly raised value seen here."
endocrine system,720,A 32-year-old woman presents with a one-year history of secondary amenorrhoea. She had been prescribed temazepam and dihydrocodeine. On examination she had galactorrhoea. Her serum prolactin was noted to be 6000 mU/L (less than450 mU/L). Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia,Hypothyroidism,Pituitary dependent Cushing's disease ,Pituitary adenoma,Stress,D,"This patient has amenorrhoea, galactorrhoea, and a grossly elevated prolactin concentration of 6000. The diagnosis is likely to be a prolactinoma most likely due to a pituitary microadenoma (microprolactinoma). Temazepam and dihydrocodeine would not cause hyperprolactinaemia. Drugs that could be responsible include:  dopamine antagonists antipsychotics (haloperidol, sulpiride) metoclopramide domperidone, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (to a lesser extent).  Hypothyroidism may cause hyperprolactinaemia but is usually mild. However, there is nothing in this patient's history to suggest either hypothyroidism or Cushing's. Stress would not produce such a picture."

Somatuline, like most other synthetic somatostatin analogues, has high affinity for HSSR-2 and 5, and low affinity for 1,3, and 4. It is activity at the 2 and 5 receptors which is thought to be primarily the reason why growth hormone secretion falls. There is no significant effect of Somatuline on fasting gastrin or secretin secretion. Prolactin levels are generally reduced by somatostatin use."
endocrine system,722,"A 20 year old female presents as she has never started her periods. On examination you notice she is short in stature, has a webbed neck and widely spaced nipples. She has a low hairline and low set ears. Bloods reveal elevated FSH and LH levels and low oestrogen levels. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pituitary disease,Premature ovarian failure,Hypothyroidism,Pregnancy,Weight loss,B,This patient is showing signs of Turners syndrome. Premature ovarian failure is poorly understood but may be an autoimmune condition. It is a feature of Turners syndrome and can occur before the age of menarche and lead to primary amenorrhea. It leads to elevated FSH and LH and low oestrogen levels. In weight loss you would expect a low FSH and LH. The other diagnoses do not explain the signs or the blood results.

He was also found to have a phaeochromocytoma. She asks about the risks of her children inheriting their father's cancer and whether they require screening. Which of the following is the correct advice?,"24 hour BP recording, yearly from age 10",Annual testing of calcium and PTH from age 10,There is no chance of them inheriting the condition,Yearly external thyroid examination,Yearly thyroid USS from age 10,B,"The prognosis of MEN-2, the underlying diagnosis here, is significantly improved by early identification of both medullary thyroid cancer and parathyroid disease. As such, yearly testing of calcium and PTH from the age of 10 is recommended. Incidence of thyroid cancer increases from the early 20s, and peaks in the fifth decade of life. Screening for MTC with yearly calcitonin is therefore usually instigated from the late teenage years. External thyroid examination is inadequate for detecting small tumours, this is therefore not recommended for screening. Thyroid USS is not superior to biochemical screening and is also therefore not recommended. Phaeochromocytoma peaks from the third decade. Screening therefore usually begins from the late teenage years. MEN-2 is an autosomal dominant condition."

A testicular germ cell tumour would no lead to this. This is not a typical presentation of sarcoidosis although it may lead to pituitary dysfunction you would expect other features to be present such as erythema nodosum and an elevated calcium. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is an abnormal proliferation and dissemination of histiocytes. Birbeck's granules within the cells are characteristic. It can present in many ways with the most typical being bony lesions, diabetes insipidus ad respiratory symptoms. It can lead to pituitary-hypothalamus dysfunction if the sella turcica is involved."
endocrine system,726,A 58 year old female with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with a swollen and deformed left ankle and foot.  There was no clear history of trauma. It is mildly painful. On examination the foot appeared flat and her ankle is red and hot and appeared deformed.  There appears to be dislocation of the joint and osteoarthritis. Inflammatory markers are normal and she is systemically well.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Gout,Fracture,Charcots joint,Osteomyelitis,Dislocation,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Charcots joint which is associated with diabetes mellitus and neuropathy.  It leads to a red, swollen, hot , deformed joint which can be painful although it is not as painful as one might expect from the clinical examination.  It can look like osteoarthritis early on in the disease.  Osteomyelitis can complicate it but this is unlikely as is gout due to the normal inflammatory markers.  Fracture and dislocation are very unlikely as there is no history of trauma and you would expect more pain to be reported."

Despite the fact that the upper limit of the normal range for triglycerides in men is considered to be 2.1, and in women it is 1.7, the JBS2 guidelines recommend a target of 1.7 mmol/l for both men and women. The reason for this is that epidemiological analyses suggest that triglycerides above 1.7 are associated with a 30% relative risk increase with respect to cardiovascular events. With respect to patients with type 2 diabetes, risk calculators should not be used to estimate 10 year cardiovascular risk when making treatment choices, this is because type 2 diabetes is considered as a secondary prevention equivalent.

In each menstrual cycle the corpus luteum develops from an ovarian follicle. The follicular theca and granulosa cells are luteinized into theca lutein (or small luteal) and granulosa lutein (or large luteal) cells respectively. These form the corpus luteum in the ovary. Large luteal cells produce the majority of progesterone but both types of luteal cells produce progesterone. Progesterone is synthesized form cholesterol.Ovarian Endocrine FunctionFollicular Structure Luteal Structure FunctionsTheca Cells Thecal Lutein Cells(small luteal)Androgen (Androstenedione) production Thecal Lutein cells produce progesteroneGranulosa Cells Granulosal Lutein Cells(large luteal)Convert androgen to estradiol via aromatase Granulosa Lutein cells produce progesteroneRoles of LH and FSHFSH stimulates Aromatase production in the granulosa cells LH stimulates Androgen production in the theca (interna) cells LH also stimulates the contraction of the smooth muscle cells of the theca externa.

You suspect Conn's syndrome. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next test?,9am Cortisol,Synacthen® test,Aldosterone-to-renin ratio,Dexamethasone suppression test,24 hour urinary catecholamines,C,Remember Conn's is a condition of raised Aldosterone (with subsequent effects on the aldosterone-renin-angiotensin system). Catecholamines and cortisol tests are not useful in diagnosing this.High aldosterone-to-renin ratio is useful in looking for Conn's (primary hyperaldosteronism) and would be an appropriate next test.The diagnosis is made via one of the following:Saline suppression test Ambulatory salt loading test Fludrocortisone suppression testIf primary hyperaldosteronism is confirmed biochemically then adrenal CT or MRI is typically performed to find the cause. Conn's Syndrome Conn's Syndrome results from primary hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium ions (and subsequently water) in exchange for potassium in the kidney. The result is increased blood volume and therefore increased blood pressure. Hypokalaemia may be present but is often within normal range.The main causes of primary hyperaldosteronism are adrenal hyperplasia (65%) and adrenal adenoma (30-35%). Note some texts refer to primary aldosteronism as Conn's. Strictly speaking Conn's is primary aldosteronism due to adrenal adenomaSecondary hyperaldosteronism is due to increased renin production in conditions such as renal artery stenosis or a renin producing tumour.

Co-existent hypertension may occur because of weight gain, but is not particularly indicative of an insulinoma. Indeed, hypertension in the context of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) may indicate a phaeochromocytoma, which of course is associated with MEN2 where insulinomas do not occur.

Among the causes of recurrent hypoglycaemic episodes in seemingly healthy patients, discriminating between sulphonylurea-induced hypoglycaemia and insulinoma is extremely important due to the different management strategies. Inappropriately high serum levels of insulin and C-peptide during episodes are characteristic features of both conditions. In contrast, hypoglycaemia caused by exogenous insulin is associated with low serum C-peptide. The history of weight gain which this patient reports is supportive of increased appetite in response to hyperinsulinaemia. In the exam you would expect the question to include a family or personal history of diabetes mellitus, or for the patient to have an occupation which allows them access to hypoglycaemics, to lead you to a diagnosis of inappropriate use of sulphonylureas. The diagnosis of insulinoma can be difficult, as tumours can be small and may only secrete insulin episodically. In this case the optimal investigation would be a prolonged fast, up to 72 hours, followed if necessary, by a period of supervised exercise. In the vast majority of cases this is enough to precipitate release of insulin from an insulinoma. During any period of hypoglycaemia, you should measure insulin, glucose, sulphonylureas, C-peptide, proinsulin and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Determination of sulphonylureas in serum or urine is possible with liquid chromatography, and should be sent at the time of an episode to exclude this diagnosis. A negative sample at a time of normoglycaemia does not assist with the diagnosis, and therefore is not indicated as a first line investigation in this case where insulinoma should be suspected. Some laboratories will decline to process a sample if it was taken during a period of normoglycaemia. It should however be done if the patient suffers an episode of hypoglycaemia whilst in hospital. No imaging technique has been shown to be sufficiently sensitive to localise insulinomas, and therefore is not the investigation of choice here. Proinsulin is the precursor of insulin and C-peptide. Only 1-3% is secreted intact, but it has a longer half-life than insulin and can bind to the insulin receptor. Levels are elevated in insulinomas, which is most marked in the fasting state. As an aside, in children and younger adults, the differential diagnosis of hypoglycaemia is broader and includes a number of inherited metabolic defects. "
endocrine system,746,Which of the following is true concerning oral hypoglycaemic agents?,Acarbose promotes insulin secretion in response to meals,Glibenclamide is excreted unchanged by the kidney,Gliclazide inhibits gluconeogenesis,Metformin can be used safely in renal failure,Metformin inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis,E,"Metformin is an insulin sensitiser and although its actions are not fully understood its main role appears to be through inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis. It is renally excreted, and can be associated with lactic acidosis when used in the setting of renal failure. Current NICE guidelines state that metformin should be avoided if the creatinine is more than 150 µmol/L or the eGFR is less than 30 ml/min/1.73m^2. Acarbose is an alpha glucosidase inhibitor which inhibits the splitting of disaccharides into glucose and so inhibits glucose absorption from the gut. Glibenclamide is cleared by hepatic metabolism but has two active metabolites, 4-trans-hydroxyglibenclamide and 3-cis-hydroxyglibenclamide, which are both renally excreted. Renal impairment therefore increases the risk of hypoglycaemia in patients taking glibenclamide. Gliclazide promotes insulin release by binding receptors on pancretic beta cells."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Adrenal adenoma,Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia,Essential hypertension,Familial glucocorticoid remediable aldosteronism,Renal artery stenosis,D,"Familial GRA is an autosomal dominant condition where a mutation leads to ACTH responsive aldosterone production from the zona fasciculata rather than the zona glomerulosa. It occurs because the regulatory portion of the 11b-OH gene binds to the aldosterone synthase gene. The hypokalaemia, resistant hypertension, and strong family history are all pointers to the underlying diagnosis. An adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia should not be responsive to corticosteroid therapy, ruling these out as possible scenarios. Equally, essential hypertension is highly unlikely given hypokalaemia in the presence of maximal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor dose. Finally, normal kidney size with no differential, and no bruits on clinical examination, whilst not ruling out renal artery stenosis, certainly diminishes the chances of this being the potential problem."

The restricted active and passive movements confirm that this patient's problems are either capsular or articular in origin rather than periarticular tendon problems where active movements are generally more restricted than passive movements. The shoulder joint is rarely affected by primary osteoarthritis.
endocrine system,751,"A 62-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus takes 30 units of long acting insulin per day and 10 units of actrapid with each meal. His HbA1c is 56 mmol/mol (7.3%) and he is having problems with hypoglycaemic episodes either late in the afternoon or during the early hours of the morning. A recent creatinine is 130 µmol/L. On examination is BP is 148/82 mmHg, pulse is 70 and regular, respiratory and abdominal examination is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Advise him to eat a snack before going to bed,Advise him to eat a snack in the mid afternoon,Decrease all three of his actrapid doses,Decrease his long acting and lunch time insulin doses,Decrease his long acting insulin dose,D,"This man is not at HbA1c target, yet he is having hypoglycaemic episodes because of the profile of his mixed insulin. As such, the best way to manage him is to transition him to meal time boluses with basal insulin at night. This can allow short acting insulin to be titrated according to the size of his meals and planned physical activity in the day. Whilst eating a snack before going to bed will help avoid hypoglycaemia, it will also lead to weight gain which he should avoid; the same applies with respect to a mid-afternoon snack. Decreasing his lunchtime insulin will reduce the likelihood of a late afternoon hypo, and decreasing the background will reduce the risk of a hypo in the early hours of the morning. His HbA1c is relatively well controlled at 56 mmol/mol (7.3%) and he is likely to be hungry around the time of the late afternoon hypo in particular, so it is by no means certain this will increase with the reduction in insulin dose."
endocrine system,752,Which of the following is a metabolic effect of exenatide?,Accelerates gastric emptying,Improves insulin sensitivity,Inhibits insulin release,Promotes gluconeogenesis by the liver,Suppresses appetite,E,"Exenatide mimics the effect of the gut hormone GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) and has favourable effects on the metabolism of individuals with diabetes mellitus. Exenatide suppresses appetite, inhibits glucose production in the liver, slows gastric emptying and stimulates insulin release. It does not increase insulin sensitivity which is achieved by drugs such as metformin and the glitazones. In summary exenatide has the following metabolic effects:  Stimulates insulin release Inhibits glucose production by the liver Slows gastric emptying, and Suppresses appetite.  "

The only relevant finding on history is that he has a very poor sense of smell. On examination he has no axillary or pubertal hair, a 3 cm penis and testicular volumes of approximately 5 ml bilaterally. Smell test reveals that he is unable to distinguish acetone and coffee. Investigations reveal:    Testosterone 4 nmol/L (10-30)   Prolactin 380 mU/L (less than450)   FSH 2.1 IU/L (1-7)   LH 1.5 IU/L (1-10)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",5-alpha reductase deficiency,Craniopharyngioma,Kallman's syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Microdeletion of the Y chromosome,C,"This patient has evidence of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with a low testosterone and a relative low follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH). In this case, there is isolated gonadotrophic deficiency as evidenced by a normal prolactin. This is seen in Kallman's syndrome, which is often associated with anosmia. In Klinefelter's syndrome an elevated LH/FSH would be expected, as this is due to testicular failure as would be the case in 5-alpha reductase deficiency (which also results in partial male pseudohermaphroditism). Craniopharyngioma is a possibility as it does cause hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism but abnormalities in sense of smell would not be expected. Y chromosome microdeletion is a cause of reduced fertility in men, but there are not usually any other signs or symptoms which accompany this. 5-alpha reductase deficiency results in a failure of the full development of male sexual characteristics before birth and during puberty. The external genitalia often appear female or ambiguous, and therefore you would expect a diagnosis much earlier in life than this. Smell is not affected."

The low grade fever is not necessarily a sign of infection, and therefore antibiotics would only usually be required if infection was suspected from other signs or symptoms.  This lady is hypoglycaemic. However, although she sounds unwell from the question stem she is conscious. She should therefore be treated with oral glucose initially rather than intravenous dextrose. The BM will normally respond rapidly to oral glucose gel, and close monitoring is critical to ensure this. Glucagon is generally only used if IV access cannot be established (as it can be used intramuscularly or subcutaneously). The abnormal thyroid function tests are often encountered in association with acute hypoadrenalism. However, giving thyroxine may actually exacerbate the condition. You should repeat thyroid function tests once she has recovered from the actue episode, and treatment can be started once she is on appropriate steroid replacement."

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial investigation?",CT scan neck,Fine needle aspiration,Free T3/T4,Radionucleotide scan,Ultrasound scan neck,E,"Ultrasound is the initial investigation of choice for thyroid nodules; it can visualise cystic lesions 2 mm or more in diameter, and solid lesions 3 mm or more in diameter. It is far more sensitive than palpation alone, with less than 10% of nodules detected by ultrasound being clinically palpable. Ultrasound is used to inform progression to fine needle aspiration. A CT scan neck is not correct because CT scanning is usually only performed to examine for local spread of malignant disease or for degree of compression of other structures in the neck. Fine needle aspiration is not correct because this follows on from ultrasound scanning. Free T3/T4 is not correct because in view of a normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), tri-iodothyronine/thyroxine (T3/T4) are unlikely to be abnormal or contribute to the underlying diagnosis. Radionucleotide scan is not correct because this is used for the investigation of thyroiditis or a toxic adenoma."

She normally takes 100 mcg of thyroxine daily, and her TSH has been stable at 1.2 for the past two to three years. Which of the following represents the correct advice with respect to managing her thyroxine dose in pregnancy?",She should reduce the dose to 75 mcg for fear of inducing foetal hyperthyroidism,She will probably be able to remain on 100 mcg for the duration of the pregnancy,She will probably need to increase the dose to 125 mcg during the pregnancy,She will probably need to increase the dose to 150 mcg immediately postpartum to cope with feeding the child,She will probably need to increase the dose to 200 mcg during the pregnancy,C,"Hypothyroidism is the commonest pre-existing endocrine disorders in pregnancy, with an incidence of 9 in 1000 pregnancies. It is most commonly caused by Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Hypothyroidism has significant consequences for both the mother and foetus. Women can develop congestive cardiac failure, megacolon, adrenal crisis, psychosis, myxoedema coma, and hyponatraemia. For the foetus, there is a small increase in the stillbirth rate and there is a need to therefore monitor the pregnancy more closely. Untreated maternal hypothyroidism can lead to pre-eclampsia, low birth weight, placental abruption, and miscarriage. Foetal thyroid development begins at 10-12 weeks gestation, with T4 secretion beginning at 18-20 weeks. T4 is critical for neural development, and is especially important during the second trimester. Maternal thyroid hormone is needed for neuronal development until 12-13 weeks, and recent research has shown children of mothers with hypothyroidism may have a lower IQ than those born to women with normal thyroid function. Prognosis for mother and foetus is however excellent with appropriate treatment. Thyroid function tests should be measured every 8-12 weeks if stable, and 4-6 weeks if medication is changed. Thyroxine treatment should be altered according to the free T4 levels as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may remain elevated even with appropriate treatment (especially in the third trimester). Reducing the dose of thyroxine is inappropriate as it runs the risk of inducing maternal hypothyroidism, and the complications associated with this. Increasing the dose by around 25mcg is what is currently recommended. There is no evidence that increasing the dose of thyroixine in the immediate postpartum period is required."

As such, it is a more useful screening test than measuring random growth hormone because release of growth hormone is pulsatile. Growth hormone is incorrect because release of growth hormone is pulsatile, as such according to the time of day when it is measured the chances of a false negative result may be increased. Glucose tolerance test rather than insulin tolerance testing is used for diagnosis of acromegaly, with failure to suppress growth hormone levels indicating a positive result.

It is diagnosed after centrifuged samples of complete semen specimens are analysed microscopically. History, physical examination, and hormone analysis are needed to determine the cause. In less than 10% of cases a testicular biopsy is required to diagnose the cause of azoospermia. Obstructive azoospermia may be congenital (absence of the vas deferens, idiopathic epididymal obstruction) or acquired (from infection, vasectomy, trauma). Couples in whom the man has congenital reproductive tract obstruction should have cystic fibrosis gene mutation analysis for both partners, as there is a high risk of the male being a CF carrier. Acquired obstruction of the genital tract can be treated using microsurgical reconstruction. Alternatively, sperm can be retrieved from the testes and subsequently used for assisted reproduction. The cause of non-obstructive azoospermia needs to be identified prior to any treatment. Androgen insensitivity syndrome results from the inability of cells to respond to androgens. In males, this can prevent masculinisation of the genitalia and development of secondary sexual characteristics. You would therefore expect some phenotypic abnormalities, as well as elevated LH levels. LH is raised in cases of idiopathic testicular failure. Kallman's syndrome is hypothalamic gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) deficiency associated with hyposmia or anosmia. Serum LH and FSH are low. Antisperm antibodies can cause 'immune infertility'. Sperm are usually present in semen but are unable to penetrate the cervical mucus to gain access to the ovum. "

For this reason they recommend commencing metformin concurrently with these interventions at the point of diagnosis. They state the recommendation is made because of metformin's  Glucose-lowering effect without significant hypoglycaemia Lack of weight gain Generally high level of acceptance Low cost.  In patients who cannot take metformin they recommend the use of either a sulphonylurea or insulin. They do not recommend one of the newer agents such as a glitazone or dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) inhibitor as a first line alternative. 
endocrine system,780,What is the most appropriate test to perform if you suspect an insulinoma?,Serum 3 hydroxybutyrate levels,"Fasting  glucose, insulin and c peptide levels",Glucose Tolerance Test,Fasting glucose and insulin levels,Insulin Stress Test,B,"The correct answer is fasting glucose, insulin and c peptide measurement simultaneously.  C peptide is the small peptide which is cleaved from insulin when it is secreted  from the beta pancreatic islets cells.  It is therefore not found in the serum of those who have injected subcutaneous insulin and is useful to rule this out.  A high C peptide and high insulin and low glucose levels is indicative of an insulinoma. The insulin stress test is useful for assessing hypothalamic pituitary access but not insulinoma.  High insulin leads to suppressed lipolysis and thus low levels of 3 hydroxybutyrate and thus may exclude hyperinsulinaemia but is not useful for the diagnosis."
endocrine system,781,A 64-year-old man presents with new onset bilateral gynaecomastia. He has been diagnosed with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome and heart failure in the last year. He underwent normal puberty at age 14. Which of the following drugs would be most likely to cause gynaecomastia?,Bisoprolol,Lanzoprazole,Rabeprazole sodium,Ranitidine,Spironolactone,E,"Research has shown that the other drugs listed above which may also be used as part of the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome have a much lower almost insignificant risk in the development of gynaecomastia.

endocrine system,782,"A 42-year-old man comes to the Emergency Department with sudden onset severe retro-orbital headache, nausea, and vomiting. He tells you he has suffered from problems with his vision over the past few days and admits to feeling increasingly tired over the past few weeks. On examination his BP is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 90 and regular. He has a right third nerve palsy.

Ocular paresis occurs in up to 80% of patients, with third nerve palsy the commonest finding. This patient requires supportive care with appropriate analgesia, and an MRI of the pituitary to confirm the diagnosis. The presentation with retro-orbital headache and normal blood pressure means that both cerebral infarction and subarchnoid haemorrhage are less likely. The abnormal clinical and laboratory findings count against a diagnosis of cluster headache. Finally, whilst a pituitary adenoma is likely to have pre-dated the presentation here, it is haemorrhage into the gland which has precipitated his attendance at the Emergency Department."

The primary management goal is to prevent hypertensive crisis, which can be harmful to both mother and foetus. Alpha blockade should be started as soon as the diagnosis is made, and should be given for 10-14 days. In pregnancy, the drug of choice is phenoxybenzamine. Doxazosin is also safe in pregnancy but can be displaced by high levels of endogenous catecholamines. Unopposed beta blockade should not be used in the management of phaeochromocytoma because of the risk of paradoxical increases in blood pressure, so those options listing beta blockade first are incorrect. Surgery is the definitive treatment for phaeochromocytoma. The timing remains challenging and controversial, and depends on gestational age, clinical response to treatment, the accessibility of the tumour, and the presence or absence of foetal distress. Laparoscopic adrenalectomy is indicated if the tumour mass is less than 7 cm, but after 24 weeks of gestation, surgical removal is recommended after an elective caesarean section. Vaginal delivery carries a higher mortality rate of 31%, compared to 19% with C-section. The anaesthetic approach is extremely important, as anaesthetia can precipitate a hypertensive crisis. General anaesthesia is recommended. The correct management in this situation is therefore to initiate alpha blockade and arrange delivery by C-section. This is not available in the options given above however, but the best option of those given is to deliver the baby. "

endocrine system,786,A 55-year-old male is admitted as an emergency with continuing abdominal pain. He has had pain for 6 days which was more severe on the first day. He smokes 30 cigarettes a day and takes approximately 40 units of alcohol per week but admits to exceeding this amount sometimes. He also complains of sudden deterioration in vision. Ophthalmoscopy shows multiple micro infarcts (cotton wool spots). What investigation would best confirm your diagnosis and guide treatment?,Blood glucose,CT scan abdomen,ERCP,Upper abdominal ultrasound,Upper GI endoscopy,B,"Ischaemic retinopathy, which causes retinal oedema and micro infarcts, causes acute visual loss. This is a very rare complication of acute pancreatitis. Early CT scanning is useful in diagnosis of acute pancreatitis where diagnostic doubt exists, usually when a significant amylase/lipase elevation is not seen. Subsequent CTs are useful to detect local complications of acute pancreatitis (necrosis, infected necrosis, fluid collections) when there is failure to improve clinically. Ultrasound should be performed to detect gallstones (if not seen on CT). Determining the exact cause of pancreatitis in heavy drinkers with gallstones can be challenging. LFTs may suggest choledocholithiasis, and MRCP may demonstrate choledocholithiasis. The latest acute pancreatitis guidelines are from the American College of Gastroenterology^1 and there has been a recent revision of the Atlanta classification of panctreatitis^2. "

He has a 10 year history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and had cervical spondylosis for which he underwent surgery eight years ago. He also confessed to drinking approximately 40 units of alcohol weekly. On examination he had a mild bilateral weakness of foot dorsiflexion, both ankle reflexes were absent and plantar responses were flexor. There was absent sensation to light touch to mid-shin level with loss of joint position sensation in the toes and absent vibration sensation below the hips. He had a marked sensory ataxia and pseudoathetosis of upper limbs. He had no evidence of a retinopathy and urinalysis was normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcohol-induced neuropathy ,Central lumbar disc prolapse,Cervical cord compression,Diabetic peripheral neuropathy,Vitamin B12 deficiency,E,"Both the peripheral nerves and the spinal cord (subacute degeneration of the cord) are affected by B12 deficiency. The earliest signs of peripheral nerve involvement are loss of vibratory sense and position, which progresses to loss of reflexes and mild-to-moderate weakness. In the late stages there may be increased tone, extensor plantars and ataxia. The legs and feet are involved more commonly than the upper limbs.  There can also be signs of anaemia and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The majority of cases of vitamin B12 deficiency are caused by impaired absorption due to pernicious anaemia, but other causes include inadequate oral intake, Crohn's disease and drugs such as metformin, anticonvulsants and PPIs. Treatment is with urgent vitamin B12 (in the presence of neurological symptoms), and care should be taken to ensure that folic acid is not given before the patient is B12 replete as this can result in fulminant neurolgical deficit.  Diabetic peripheral neuropathy usually goes in parallel with retinopathy and nephropathy, which are not described in this patient. It is also slowly progressive and affects mainly the spinothalamic pathway (rather than the dorsal columns). Alcohol induced peripheral neuropathy is also slowly progressive and affects mainly the spinothalamic pathway. "

From the given option TFT is the appropriate test as thyrotoxycosis is a leading cause of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and thyrotoxicosis is the probable cause of weight loss of this lady
endocrine system,795,Which of the following statements is correct with regard to oxytocin?,Lowers the threshold for depolarisation of the uterine smooth muscle,The sensitivity of the uterus to oxytocin decreases as pregnancy progresses,Is synthesised in the posterior pituitary gland,Has 10% of the antidiuretic activity of antidiuretic hormone (ADH),Causes relaxation of myoepithelial cells in mammary glands,A,"Oxytocin is synthesised in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and is then transported in secretory granules along axons to the posterior pituitary gland, from which it is released.The primary role of oxytocin is to eject milk from the lactating mammary gland in response to suckling. It achieves this by causing contraction of the myoepithelial cells that surround the alveoli of the mammary gland.The principal clinical uses of synthetic oxytocin are to induce labour at term and to induce sustained uterine contraction which is required for post‐partum or post‐termination haemostasis. By lowering the threshold for depolarisation of uterine smooth muscle, oxytocin exerts a contracting effect on the gravid uterus. The sensitivity of the uterus to oxytocin increases as the pregnancy progresses. Oxytocin has only 0.5‐1% of the antidiuretic activity of ADH when administered in high doses, introducing the possibility of water intoxication."

On examination his blood pressure is 156/90 mmHg, his pulse is 80 and his BMI is 30. Of note on routine investigations is a raised triglyceride level of 3.1 mmol/L (0.7-2.1). Which of the following is associated with elevated triglycerides?",Decreased hepatic fat,Increased insulin resistance,Increased subcutaneous fat,Reduced cardiovascular risk,Reduced insulin requirements,B,"The answer is increased insulin resistance. Elevated triglycerides are associated with disordered energy handling by adipocytes. This is not only manifest by raised lipid levels, but also by an inability of cells to take up glucose properly, leading to increased insulin resistance. This leads to increased insulin requirements. This increased insulin resistance is associated with a constellation of other cardiovascular risk factors including hypertension, hypercoagulability, and low HDL cholesterol. Hepatic fat content is a determinant of postprandial triglyceride levels in type 2 diabetes, and increased hepatic fat is associated with elevated triglyceride levels. A statement by the American Heart Association in 2011 showed that subcutaneous fat may serve as a protective factor with regard to the metabolic consequences of obesity, and a relative paucity (i.e., lipodystrophy) is associated with hypertriglyceridemia.

His body mass index is 29. He does not have any other comorbidities. Which of the following agents is the most appropriate choice to control his diabetes?",Insulin,Liraglutide,Nateglinide,Pioglitazone,Sitagliptin,E,"The patient's occupation means that insulin should be avoided if possible due to driving restrictions, whilst ensuring sugar control is optimised. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 mimetic that is only recommended for use in patients who are overweight or where weight loss would be beneficial to other comorbidities. It is also contraindicated if the eGFR is less than 60. Nateglinide is one of the insulin secretogogues. These have not been approved for use by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Pioglitazone is a glitazone. These drugs have been associated with a range of problems, including an increased risk of heart failure and cardiovascular disease, bladder cancer, and fractures. The glitazones sensitise tissues to insulin and, given the patient's BMI, insulin resistance may be less of a problem in this patient. These considerations make sitagliptin the most appropriate choice. The dose of gliclazide may need to be reduced when starting this drug due to the risk of hypoglycaemia."

He has become increasingly confused with worsening symptoms of diarrhoea over the past few weeks. You find that he has impaired short term memory and increased skin pigmentation. Deficiency of which vitamin is a potential problem?,Ascorbic acid,Folate,Niacin,Riboflavin,Thiamine,C,"Extensive metastases from carcinoid can lead to metabolism of very large amounts of tryptophan; this then leads to a pellagra-like picture. In normal patients, only 1% of dietary tryptophan is converted to serotonin, in patients with carcinoid syndrome this value may increase to 70%. The diversion of tryptophan to making serotonin in patients with metastatic tumors can result in tryptophan deficiency. Carcinoid syndrome can then lead to niacin deficiency, and clinical manifestations of pellagra. None of the other vitamins listed are deficient in patients with metastatic carcinoid, so niacin is the only possible correct answer. Thiamine deficiency is associated with memory loss, but is also associated with peripheral neuropathy and tends to occur in alcoholic individuals."

MODY3 (mutation of HNF1alpha) accounts for 70% of cases of MODY and is sensitive to treatment with sulphonylureas and is most likely in this case. Often insulin treatment will ultimately be required. Mody2 is due to a mutation in glucokinase and is often associated with glucose levels of 5 to 6 mmol and is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However it is important to identify as it can lead to reduced birthweight in pregnancy. MODY 1 (mutation of HNF4alpha) is much less common and presents later. Again it is responsive to sulphonylureas although insulin may be required. MODY5 due to mutation in HNF1beta leads to renal cysts and proteinuria as well as diabetes. MODY4 (IPF1 mutation) and MODY6 due to NeuroD1 mutation are rare and little is known at present.
endocrine system,813,"A 51-year-old district nurse presented with a history of near fainting episodes which were promptly relieved by eating chocolates. At her last hospital admission, her simultaneous blood results were as follows:    Plasma glucose 1.8 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Serum insulin 58 pmol/L (less than21)   C peptide Undetectable -    Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcohol induced hypoglycaemia,Exogenous insulin administration,Growth hormone deficiency,Insulinoma,Sulfonylurea induced hypoglycaemia,B,"The vignette of a middle aged woman who has spontaneous hypoglycaemia and inappropriately high insulin (should be undetectable in presence of hypoglycaemia) would suggest insulinoma. Yet, the C peptide is undetectable (indicating she has been administering insulin as the C peptide is released with endogenous insulin) and her occupation suggests access to medication including insulin. Growth hormone deficiency alters insulin-like growth factor levels, but not insulin itself. The fact that the C-peptide is undetectable indicates that the raised insulin is not secondary to sulphonylureas, which increase endogenous insulin production. The link between alcohol and hypoglycaemia is complex, but includes preferential processing of alcohol in the liver and increased late phase insulin secretion from the pancreas. Raised C-peptide would be expected in the setting of raised insulin in this situation."
endocrine system,814,With respect to the regulation of growth hormone secretion,Insulin-like growth factors stimulate secretion,Peak secretion occurs around midnight,Peak secretion occurs around 8 am,Peak secretion occurs in the first 2 hours of deep sleep,Cortisol inhibits secretion,D,"growth hormone Secretion is regulated by· HYPOTHALAMUS - Growth hormone releasing hormone Somatostatin inhibits release · Glucose and fatty acids - fall in concentration stimulated GH release. Oral glucose load rapidly suppresses GH release. Secretion increased during prolonged fasting· Amino acids (arginine especially) - increased concentration stimulates GH release · Fall in plasma free fatty acids increase GH secretion· Secretion has circadian rhythm - increased secretion during periods of deep sleep. Peak release during first 2h of deep sleep.

endocrine system,816,Which of the following is true concerning osteomyelitis complicating diabetic foot ulcers?,A diagnosis of osteomyelitis should be considered if bone is visible at the ulcer base,A skin biopsy is indicated to make a definitive diagnosis,Haematogenous spread is the most common source,Less than 2% of patients with a diabetic foot ulcer develop osteomyelitis,Surgical debridement and intravenous antibiotics are usually the first line of management,A,Osteomyelitis is a common complication seen in patients with diabetic foot ulcers and can affect up to 15% of patients. Haematogenous spread is not the most common source and a contiguous spread from adjacent soft tissues is the most common cause. The diagnosis should be considered if bone is visible or palpable in the ulcer base. Bone biopsy for culture and sensitivity is a very useful investigation in making a confirmatory diagnosis of osteomyelitis. Surgical debridment is indicated only if there is associated extensive soft tissue contamination with slough or necrotic tissue. Long term oral antibiotics (with good bone penetration such as fusidic acid or clarithromycin) is usually sufficient to treat osteomyelitis associated with diabetic foot ulcers.

As such an androgen secreting tumour must be considered as a possible diagnosis. Abdominal ultrasound, CT or MRI would be follow-on investigations to elucidate whether an adrenal or ovarian tumour is the underlying cause. This woman is of normal weight and has no features suggestive of Cushing's. Therefore this is not a likely diagnosis, although rarely Cushing's may be associated with hyperandrogenism. Equally the possibility that she is a normal individual is ruled out by the testosterone level. Whilst obesity and PCOS may be associated with rises in testosterone, it is never to this degree."

Type 4 renal tubular acidosis is not a tubular disorder at all, but is included in the classification as it is associated with a mild (normal anion gap) metabolic acidosis due to a physiological reduction in proximal tubular ammonium excretion. The underlying cause of this is hypoaldoseteronism, due to either:  primary deficiency hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism, or aldosterone resistance (caused by eplerenone, spironolactone, trimethoprim, pentamidine, or pseudohypoaldosteronism).  It can also be caused by collecting duct dysfunction from renal insufficiency. The cardinal feature is hyperkalaemia and normal urinary acidification. Sodium wasting is a variable feature of type 4 renal tubular acidosis, as aldosterone normally enhances sodium reabsorption. It is not usually as marked as in this case, but it is possible the diuretic has exacerbated it. Treatment of type 4 renal tubular acidosis depends on the underlying cause. If there is aldosterone deficiency fludrocortisone can be used. In cases of aldosterone resistance, dietary potassium restriction, loop diuretics, and low dose oral sodium bicarbonate can be trialled. Whilst bendroflumethiazide can cause hyponatraemia, this gentleman has been taking it for three years but his symptoms are new in onset. In addition, bendroflumethiazide is usually associated with hypokalaemia. This gentleman has only had one episode of diarrhoea, which is unlikely to have caused this level or electrolyte disturbance. Hyperglycaemia can cause a dilutional hyponatraemia, but this is unlikely to happen to such an extent at a glucose of 13. Inappropriate ADH secretion could cause this hyponatraemia, but potassium levels are usually normal (if affected, they are usually reduced)."

Beta-HCG has a degree of thyroid stimulating activity. In the circumstances it is likely that this has driven thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) down to below the lower limit of normal. No intervention is necessary, and there is no value in using anti-thyroid drugs in this situation. De Quervain's thyroiditis follows symptoms of a viral illness and is usually associated with pain over the gland. It may be associated with transient hypo- or hyperthyroidism.

There is a mild elevation of prolactin. There is evidence of an elevated IGF1 levels. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Testicular Cancer - Teratoma,Hypothyroidism,Pituitary Adenoma,Testicular Cancer - Seminoma,Vascular Disease,C,The finding of elevated IGF1 suggests acromegaly which is caused by a pituitary adenoma secreting excessive amounts of growth hormone. When the pituitary adenoma is large this can lead to hypopituitarism . The patient has a low libido and erectile dysfunction due to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism as both GnRH and testosterone levels are low. The patient should be investigated due to the finding of a lump in his testes however testicular cancer would not lead to hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.

Presentation is often in childhood with gastrointestinal upset, failure to thrive and polyuria, but it can present in adolescence also. The classic abnormalities seen on bloods are hypokalaemic alkalosis and elevated renin and aldosterone levels. The blood pressure is usually normal, and oedema is not a classic sign. Hyponatraemia and hypochloraemia may also be present. Urinary sodium, potassium and chloride are raised. Treatment is aimed at preventing potassium wasting, for example with spironolactone and electrolyte supplements. Indomethacin is also effective, by inhibiting excess prostaglandin synthesis. Apparent mineralocorticoid excess is a rare form of pseudohyperaldosteronism which is associated with early onset severe hypertension, which is not present in this case. In Cushing's disease/syndrome the patient is often hypertensive rather than normotensive as described here. Proximal muscle wasting is often marked and is often commented on in the stem in combination with a description of the truncal obesity. This level of hypokalaemia is also unusual in Cushing's. Conn's syndrome presents with hypertension in addition to hypokalaemia and alkalosis. Hypokalaemic periodic paralysis is a rare channelopathy characterised by intermittent weakness and paralysis with corresponding falls in the potassium levels in the blood.

endocrine system,841,"You are reviewing new potential targets for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. When thinking about targets, which of the following is true?",GIP has a more potent effect on insulin release than GLP-1,Glucokinase activators should not cause hypoglycaemia,Metformin non-response is not usually genetic,PPAR gamma agonists increase bone mineral density,TCF7L2 mutations may be associated with a reduced incretin response,E,"The incretin response to an oral glucose challenge is lost in patients who develop type 2 diabetes. This means that they lose the response generated by incretin hormones such as GLP-1 and GIP which enhances insulin release and leads to satiety. Those patients who carry TCF7L2 mutations have a blunted incretin response. Infusion of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) leads to a more potent incretin effect than gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), as such it is GLP-1 based therapies that have been the first incretin agents to be developed.

A serum cortisol concentration later returns as 800 nmol/L (120-600). Which of the following would be the most relevant investigation for this man?",Chest x ray,CT head scan,Electrocardiogram,Prolonged 72 hour fast,Short Synacthen test,D,"The historical and biochemical evidence here suggests a diagnosis of spontaneous hypoglycaemia and the most likely cause would be an insulinoma. However, one would wish to exclude possible drug administration and although not mentioned here, a sulphonylurea screen should be undertaken. He has presented with symptomatic hypoglycaemia, is not diabetic and therefore should not have received insulin or a sulphonylurea. There is nothing to suggest alcohol or drug misuse. Similarly, there is nothing to suggest sepsis. However, to prove a diagnosis of spontaneous hypoglycaemia, a prolonged fast is required and, should he develop hypoglycaemia, measurement of insulin and C peptide will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. The appropriate cortisol response during his hypoglycaemic episode (cortisol 800) excludes hypoadrenalism."
endocrine system,847,An 85-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus presented with sudden onset of wild flinging movements of the left arm which disappeared during sleep. What is the most likely explanation?,Contralateral subthalamic nucleus infarction,Focal motor seizures,Hypoglycaemia,Ipsilateral caudate nucleus infarction,Ipsilateral cerebellar infarction,A,"This is hemiballismus, and in a patient with diabetes is likely to be due to a vascular event in the contralateral subthalamic nucleus. Hemiballismus is usually characterised by involuntary flinging motions of the extremities, which are often violent. It is continuous and random, and can involve proximal, distal or facial muscles. It is always unilateral, but it is common for arms and legs to move together. The movements worsens with activity, and decrease with relaxation. It results from a decrease in activity of the subthalamic nucleus of the basal ganglia, which results in decreased suppression of involuntary movements. In addition to strokes there are a number of other causes of hemiballismus. These include:  traumatic brain activity amyotrophic lateral sclerosis hypergylcaemia malignancy vascular malformations tuberculomas, and demyelinating plaques.  Treatment should initially start with identifying and treating the cause. When pharmacological treatment is necessary this is usually initially with an antidopaminergic such as haloperidol or chlorpromazine. Topiramate can be used, as can intrathecal baclofen, botulinum toxin and tetrabenazine. Functional neurosurgery can be used for cases which have failed to respond to other treatment."

endocrine system,849,"A patient with type 2 diabetes being treated with gliclazide presents with sweating and dizziness. Blood glucose was 1.9 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). He is on long-standing treatment for hypertension, atrial fibrillation, joint pain, and indigestion. These treatments have not changed recently. You understand that he has recently been prescribed an agent for balanitis by his GP. Which of the following drugs may be responsible for increasing the likelihood of hypoglycaemia in this situation?",Aspirin,Atenolol,Digoxin,Fluconazole,Ranitidine,D,"As a result of drug interaction, hypoglycaemia may be potentiated when a sulfonylurea is used concurrently with agents such as:  Long-acting sulfonamides Tuberculostatics Phenylbutazone Clofibrate Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors Coumarin derivatives Salicylates Probenecid Propranolol Cimetidine Disopyramide, and Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.  Gliclazide is a sulphonylurea drug with an intermediate half life of around 11 hours. It is extensively metabolised within the liver by CYP2C9. Within the circulation, gliclazide is highly bound to plasma proteins, about 94%. Renal clearance accounts for only 4% of total drug clearance. Therefore gliclazide action can be potentiated predominantly by two mechanisms:  displacement of the drug from plasma proteins to give more free (unbound) drug - some agents such as aspirin can do this, and intereference with the hepatic metabolism of the drug.  The only change in this patient's treatment recently has been the addition of an antimicrobial agent. Fluconazole has a low level of plasma protein binding and it is excreted by the kidney. However, it is also a potent inhibitor of CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 and can thus interact with gliclazide and other sulphonylureas (for example, glimepiride, glibenclamide, tolbutamide, and glipizide). Thus the best answer in this scenario would be likely to be fluconazole."

During one of these episodes his BM is found to be 2.9. Which of the following investigation will be most useful in confirming the diagnosis?","Random glucose, insulin, proinsulin and c peptide levels","Fasting (48 hours or 72 hours) glucose, insulin, proinsulin and c peptide levels",Glucose tolerance test,Fasting glucose,C peptide level,B,"The most likely diagnosis to consider is an Insulinoma. They are the most comon neuroendocrine tumour and the majority are found in pancreatic islet cells. 90% are benign whilst 10% are malignant. They are a feature of MEN type 1. Diagnosis is made via a fasting glucose, C peptide, insulin and proinsulin levels. Traditionally a 72 hour fast was utilised however many have shortened this to 48 hours. Sulfonylureas should also be screened for. In self administered insulin, c peptide levels would be low and therefore measuring c peptide alone is only useful in excluding this as it will be normal or elevated in insulinoma or sulphonylurea abuse. Glucose tolerance test are utilised in the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Insulin stress tests are not indicated."

endocrine system,857,A 45-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a three-month history of sweats and weight gain of 7 kg. Her sweats tend to be worse in the morning and with exercise and she often feels light-headed. On examination she has a BMI of 30 kg/m^2 but no abnormality is noted. Urinalysis negative. Which is the likely diagnosis?,Acromegaly,Diabetes mellitus,Insulinoma,Phaeochromocytoma,Primary ovarian failure,C,"This patient has sweats and weight gain exacerbated by exercise or fasting (in the morning) and associated with lightheadedness. This information suggests the presence of an insulinoma. Phaeochromocytoma is unlikely as there is typically weight loss and there is no mention of hypertension. If this were acromegaly, the features should be described. In diabetes mellitus per se, possibly urinalysis would be expected to show glycosuria. Primary ovarian failure means that the patient never has a normal menstrual cycle, and has the triad of amenorrhea, hypergonadotropinism, and hypoestrogenism. It would be extremely rare for this condition not to be diagnosed by the age of 40. Presenting features of insulinoma include:  double vision tachycardia/palpitations 'weakness' confusion memory loss seizures sweating hunger, and weight gain.  "

On examination her BP is 142/84 mmHg, there is mild proximal muscle weakness, but no other significant findings. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 128 g/L (115 - 165)   White cells 5.2 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelet 188 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135 - 146)   Potassium 4.9 mmol/L (3.5 - 5)   Creatinine 133 µmol/L (79 - 118)   Calcium 2.05 mmol/L (2.20 - 2.60)   HbA1c 56 mmol/mol (less than36)   7.3% (less than5.5)   TSH 4.8 mU/L (0.5 - 5.0)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Fibromyalgia,Hypothyroidism,Osteomalacia,Osteoporosis,Myositis,C,"Osteomalacia is correct given this woman's ethnic origin, her symptoms, and her low calcium level. Osteomalacia is related to low levels of vitamin D and occurs more commonly in patients of South Asian origin, particularly those who have a cultural tendency to spend more time inside. Symptoms include bony pain, particularly around the hips and lower back, and proximal myopathy. The low calcium seen on routine blood testing fits with this diagnosis, phosphate is likely to be low, with raised alkaline phosphatase. Management in this case involves vitamin D supplementation, dietary review to encourage adequate dairy intake, and encouragement to spend more time in the sun. Fibromyalgia is incorrect because the low calcium points us towards an alternative diagnosis, and her pain is confined to a limited region. Hypothyroidism is incorrect because the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is at the upper end of the normal range. Osteoporosis is incorrect because we are not given evidence of fracture, bone mineral density, and the low calcium and proximal myopathy are more in keeping with osteomalacia. Myositis is incorrect because there is no evidence of generalised myopathy, and if this were the diagnosis we might expect a creatine kinase (CK) level in the investigations provided."

Multiple drugs are implicated, acting either to remove inhibitor pathways or directly stimulating prolactin production from lactotroph cells. Of those listed above, metoclopramide is the one which is most commonly associated with symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia. It stimulates prolactin release by blocking dopamine. Symptomatic hyperprolactinaemia has only been reported in association with cimetidine in case reports. Omeprazole, citalopram and cyclizine are not thought to cause hyperprolactinaemia. "

There is also a history of hypertension for which she takes bendroflumethiazide, ramipril, and amlodipine. She also uses ranitidine for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. On examination her BP is 155/92 mmHg, her pulse is 68 and regular. Her BMI is 33. Unfortunately a fasting plasma glucose is elevated, measured at 9.2 mmol/L. Which of the following agents is most likely to have contributed to her presentation with diabetes?",Amlodipine,Bendroflumethiazide,Ramipril,Ranitidine,Risperidone,E,"Both typical antipsychotics and antihypertensives (thiazides and beta blockers), have been shown in meta-analyses to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance and increased risk of type 2 diabetes. The risk is relatively larger for risperidone than thiazides however, so it is risperidone which is the correct answer here. One epidemiology study suggested a relative risk for development of diabetes of 1.6, versus controls not taking risperidone. Amlodipine, ramipril, and ranitidine are not thought to be associated with increased risk of impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes. Bendroflumethiazide and atenolol were shown in a meta-analysis of blood pressure lowering to be associated with impaired glucose tolerance, although on an individual patient basis, this risk is less than that for risperidone."

These features are consistent with syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (ADH). Of the drugs listed, fluoxetine is the most likely cause of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Lithium can cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus but this would be associated with a raised serum sodium. "

He has hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, and what appears to be a mild primary hypothyroidism. The diagnosis is likely to be Addison's (primary hypoadrenalism) disease and the most appropriate test would be a short Synacthen test. The link between Addison's and primary hypothyroidism is that they are both conditions in the complex of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome. Other possible associations of this cluster would be:  type 1 diabetes vitiligo pernicious anaemia, and chronic active hepatitis.  An insulin tolerance test is contraindicated in patients in whom cortisol is less than 100 nmol/L.

Attacks can last from several minutes to hours, and can be related to exercise or a significant carbohydrate load. Occasionally the respiratory and bulbar muscles may be involved. The history given is too acute to be either Guillain-Barré or myositis, with Guillain-Barré associated with weakness developing over a number of days, and myositis taking a more chronic course with muscle tenderness. Without the presence of thyrotoxicosis, this picture would fit with hypokalaemic periodic paralysis."

Which is the most likely type of this lung tumour?",Adenocarcinoma,Carcinoid,Large cell,Small cell,Squamous cell,B,"This history is consistent with a bronchial carcinoid which is secreting GHRH and resulting in acromegaly. Carcinoid tumours are the most common neuroendocrine tumours, and usually originate in the enterochromaffin cells. The most common location is the gastrointestinal tract, but that can also occur in the bronchi and lungs. The masses are typically silent, but they can present due to ectopic hormone secretion or carcinoid heart disease. The carcinoid syndrome presents in approximately 10% of cases, more commonly those with GI tract primaries, and is predominantly due to release of 5-HT.

Laparoscopic adrenalectomy would be advised where pituitary surgery has failed. Ketoconazole may be an effective treatment for patients unfit for surgery by inhibition of various enzymes which in turn blocks ACTH production and secretion. opDDD is used for adrenal carcinomas. Yttrium implantation has been abandoned even for acromegaly as is pretty useless. The recurrence rate for Cushing's disease after surgery is of the order of 20-30% in most series and depends on the size of the tumour with macroadenomas having a higher rate of relapse.

According to NICE guidance, which of the following management strategies would be advisable for this lady?",Supported diet and physical activity modification,Extended period of a very low calorie diet,General advice on healthy weight and lifestyle,Referral for bariatric surgery,Pharmacological intervention,A,"NICE recommendations are first to classify the level of this lady's obesity:    Classification BMI kg/m^2   Healthy weight 18.5-24.9   Overweight 25-29.9   Obesity I 30-34.9   Obesity II 35-39.9   Obesity III 40 or more    The health risks associated with being overweight or obese should be based on both assessment of BMI and waist circumference. In people with obesity II and a very high waist circumference, as is the case for this lady, management should be with diet and physical activity advice with consideration of medication if needed.  Diets that have a 600kcal/day deficit or are low-fat, in combination with expert support and intensive follow-up, are recommended for sustainable weight loss.   Pharmacological treatment is only indicated after dietary, exercise and behavioural approaches have been started and evaulated, and are generally reserved for those who have not reached their target weight loss or have reached a plateau despite other approaches.   A very low calorie diet (usually less than800kcal/day) is only recommended as part of a multicomponent weight management strategy for obese patients who have a clinically-assessed need to rapidly lose weight (e.g. fertility treatment, joint replacement surgery). It should be followed for a maximum of 12 weeks.   Bariatric surgery is a treatment option if all the following criteria are fulfilled:  BMI of 40kg/m^2 or more, or between 35-40kg/m^2 and other significant disease (e.g. T2DM) which could be improved by weight loss Non-surgical measures have been tried but clinically beneficial weight loss has not been achieved or maintained adequately The patient is fit for anaesthesia and surgery The patient commits to the need for long-term follow-up, which includes intensive management in a tier 3 service  General advice on healthy eating and exercise is good for obesity prevention but is unlikely to be successful in this lady who has been significantly obese for a decade.

endocrine system,874,Which substance can be secreted by a tumour which leads to hypercalcaemia?,PTH,ACTH,Vitamin D,PTH like peptide,Calcitonin,D,In tumours such as squamous cell lung cancer and gastric carcinoma PTH like peptide is secreted and leads to hypercalcaemia.
endocrine system,875,"A 59-year-old woman has had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus for over two decades. The degree of control of her disease is characterised by the laboratory finding of a HbA1c of 87 mmol/mol (20-42). She complains of repeated episodes of abdominal pain following meals. These episodes have become more frequent and last for longer periods over the last couple of months. On physical examination, there are no abdominal masses or enlarged liver, spleen, or kidneys and no tenderness to palpation. Which of the following findings is most likely to be present?",Acute pancreatitis,Chronic renal failure,Hepatic infarction,Mesenteric artery occlusion,Ruptured aortic aneurysm,D,"Diabetes, especially type 2 diabetes, is associated with macrovascular disease. Smoking is a further risk factor for macrovascular atherosclerosis. After a meal, splanchnic blood flow is increased. If the mesenteric artery is occluded, the lack of blood flow to the bowel will produce ischaemic type pain. Chronic renal failure may be present but would not cause post prandial pain. Ruptured aortic aneurysm would normally present acutely with hypotension, cold lower limbs with reduced pulses, and a pulsatile, tender abdominal mass. Pancreatitis is unlikely given the history and the lack of epigastric tenderness. Hepatic infarction should lead to right upper quadrant pain."

endocrine system,877,A 58-year-old female is admitted for laparoscopic adrenalectomy for a right-sided phaeochromocytoma. Which one of the following statements concerning her management is correct?,Glucagons should be used to treat post-operative hypoglycaemia,Hypotension is an anticipated immediate post-operative complication,Hypotension may persist post-operatively,IV hydrocortisone is usually required post-operatively,Phenoxybenzamine and propranolol should be commenced the day prior to surgery,B,"Phaeochromocytoma is a tumour of the chromaffin cells, usually within the adrenal medulla. Ten per cent are bilateral and 10% are malignant tumours. It may occur as part of multiple endocrine adenomatosis or in association with neurofibromatosis. Symptoms are related to the secretion of epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Treatment consists of pharmacological control of blood pressure and heart rate, using alpha- and beta-receptor antagonists usually commenced weeks before surgery. A standard combination is phenoxybenzamine (alpha) and propranolol (beta), but the alpha-blockade must be initiated before the beta-blockade to avoid exacerbating the hypertension. These patients require invasive cardiovascular monitoring (arterial line and central venous catheter) which should be continued into the postoperative period. The blood pressure may fall markedly following removal of the tumour (low blood volume and persistent alpha-blockade) and a norepinephrine infusion may be required. Steroids are usually not required as sufficient corticosteroids are released by the remaining adrenal gland. Patients are all electively admitted into the intensive care unit for at least 24 hours postoperatively, due to continuing cardiovascular instability. A chest x ray is required is confirm correct placement of the central venous catheter and to rule out a pneumothorax. Hypoglycaemia may occur (treated with glucose/dextrose infusions), and hypertension can persist for up to four days, despite completely removing the tumour."
endocrine system,878,You are developing a new long acting antidiuretic hormone antagonist for the treatment of SIADH. Where would you expect to see binding of your antagonist to occur within the kidney?,Aquaporin 1 channels,Aquaporin 2 channels,Aquaporin 3 channels,V1 receptors,V2 receptors,E,"ADH binds to V2 receptors which are found on the peritubular surface of cells in the distal convoluted tubule and medullary collecting duct. This leads to insertion of aquaporin channels into the luminal membrane, enhancing permeability to water. V1 receptors are involved in mediating platelet aggregation as well as vasoconstriction and do not have a role in controlling water reabsorption rather increasing systemic vascular resistance. There are multiple subtypes of aquaporin channels, some of which, such as aquaporin 3, are involved in passage of water through the skin.   "
endocrine system,879,Beta and Delta Thalassemia are associated with abnormalities to which chromosome,Chromosome 6,Chromosome 11,Chromosome 16,Chromosome 18,X Chromosome,B,Haemoglobin is made of of 4 globular protein chains. Adult haemoglobin (HbA) is made of 2 alpha globulin chains and 2 beta globulin chains and accounts for 97% of total haemoglobin in a normal adult. HbA2 is a normal variant of hemoglobin A that consists of two alpha and two delta chains and makes up 1.5-3% of total haemoglobin. Fetal haemagobin (HBF) is the main haemoglobin type in the fetus and persists after birth for around 6 months. Fetal hemoglobin is composed of two alpha and two gamma subunitsThe alpha globulin chain is coded for by genes on Chromosome 16. Alpha Thalassemias are therefore associated with Chromosome16 defectsThe beta and delta globulin chains are coded for by genes on Chromosome 11. Beta and Delta Thalassemias are therefore associated with Chromosome 11 Defects Hemoglobinopathy
endocrine system,880,A 55-year-old man with type 2 diabetes has noticed elevation of his blood glucose levels on a new treatment for his lipids. He says his diet and exercise levels are unchanged his HbA1c has also deteriorated by about 0.5%. Which one of the following drugs is the likely cause?,Cholestyramine,Ezetimibe,Fenofibrate,Nicotinic acid,Rosuvastatin,D,"The mechanism of the effect of nicotinic acid on glucose is not entirely clear but, in some patients, it may increase blood glucose. For the majority of patients with diabetes it has a minimal effect. A number of postulated mechanisms have been suggested for this. Since nicotinic acid inhibits triglyceride synthesis, it may be that the increased availability of free fatty acids stimulates hepatic glucose output by increasing gluconeogenesis or replacing glucose as the primary energy source. Higher levels of fatty acids may also block glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Direct effects if beta-cell function have also been postulated. A 2011 meta-analysis showed an increase risk of inducing diabetes in patients treated with intensive statin therapy, compared to moderate doses. However, discussion in the literature has suggested there may have been a number of confounding factors leading to increased diabetic risk in these patients. Regardless of this, it did not look at whether statins worsened HbA1c in established diabetics, and therefore you cannot extrapolate its findings to this question. Cholestyramine interacts with a number of medications (including oral hypoglycaemics), due to impact on drug absorption. However, in clinical practice it does not usually worsen diabetic control (and in fact some studies have shown improved glycaemic control). Fenofibrate and ezetimibe have not been shown to worsen diabetic control. "

This has resulted in abnormal liver function tests and weight gain. The gynaecomastia may be related purely to obesity or to increased peripheral production of oestrogens coupled with decreased hepatic metabolism of sex steroids. Erectile dysfunction is also of course related to alcohol consumption. Given the history we are provided with, and the fact this patient only has mild obesity and controlled hypertension, Cushing's is unlikely. Haemochromatosis could be considered but the prevelance is much less than excess alcohol use. Klinefelter's would not fit well with this phenotype and earlier presentation would be expected. Simple obesity should not be associated with other medical conditions."

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ectopic ACTH secretion,Exogenous steroids,Cushings disease,Hypothyroidism,Addisons disease,A,"This patient has a small cell lung cancer and features of excessive steroid secretion.  Small cell lung cancer is known to act as an ectopic source of ACTH and thus lead to these features.  It is differentiated from excessive steroids due to the hyperpigmentation as ACTH has a melanocyte stimulating effect.  Cushings disease results in a similar picture however specifically refers to a pituitary adenoma and given the small cell lung cancer, ectopic ACTH is more likely."

In reality hypokalaemia is present in less than a third of patients. Headache is a common presenting complaint though many are asymptomatic. Conn's Syndrome Conn's Syndrome results from primary hyperaldosteronism. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium ions (and subsequently water) in exchange for potassium in the kidney. The result is increased blood volume and therefore increased blood pressure. Hypokalaemia may be present but is often within normal range.The main causes of primary hyperaldosteronism are adrenal hyperplasia (65%) and adrenal adenoma (30-35%). Note some texts refer to primary aldosteronism as Conn's. Strictly speaking Conn's is primary aldosteronism due to adrenal adenomaSecondary hyperaldosteronism is due to increased renin production in conditions such as renal artery stenosis or a renin producing tumour."

Which of the following according to the ADA/EASD consensus would be the most appropriate therapy for him?",Albiglutide,Exenatide,Liraglutide,Pramlintide,Taspoglutide,B,"The consensus recommends the use of proven therapies (sulphonylurea or insulin) as first choice add-in options to metformin. However in special situations, for example, morbid obesity or risk of hypoglycaemia, exenatide may be considered as an alternative. Pramlintide is an amylin agonist, the predominant effects of which include:  reduction in glucagon inhibition of gastric emptying, and nausea.  The guidelines do not recommend it, and it is only licensed in the United States as an adjunct to insulin therapy. Albiglutide is a weekly GLP-1 analogue in development.

Which of the following findings on laboratory investigation or clinical examination would be most associated with increased cardiovascular risk?",HbA1c 57 mmol/mol (less than37),HDL cholesterol 2.3 mmol/L (1.0-2.3),LDL cholesterol 2.4 mmol/L (less than4.0),Triglyceride 2.8 mmol/L (0.5-1.7),Urate 0.4 mmol/L (0.18-0.42),D,"The answer is triglyceride 2.8 mmol/L. High triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are the commonest lipid abnormality seen in type 2 diabetes, and both are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In total, triglycerides above 1.7 are thought to be associated with a 30% increase in relative cardiovascular risk. An HbA1c of 58 mmol/mol would not be considered to be a very excessive cardiovascular risk indicator in a 72-year-old patient with type 2 diabetes. The ACCORD study suggested that targeting lower HbA1c in patients with long established diabetes may be associated with increased mortality, although this effect has not been seen in other studies.

Pituitatry apoplexy is caused by acute haemorrhage or infarction of the pituitary gland. A pituitary adenoma usually pre-exists. The visual symptoms include reduced acuity, visual field impairment, and ocular motility dysfunction. This is due to involvement of the optic nerve, chiasm, and cavernous sinus. Predisposing factors include bromocriptine, head injury, pregnancy, irradiation, and endocrine stimulation tests. Endocrinologically, the main initial problem is a lack of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which results in a lack of cortisol and the features of an 'Addisonian crisis', i.e. hypotension, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, and hypoglycaemia. Subacutely, there can be deficiency in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and gonadotropins (LH and FSH). The raised white cell count and thrombocytosis here likely reflects a stress response. Treatment is with urgent steroid replacement and imaging to confirm the diagnosis, with consideration of neurosurgical decompression. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is a possibility in this case, but the hormone dysfunction makes pituitary apoplexy more likely. The hormone dysfunction also make the other options less likely. Altered mental status is usually more dominant in cases of encephalitis. Whilst migraine can imitate a number of different conditions, this lady is extremely unwell and migraine does not account for this."

Which of the following would be the most appropriate management approach for this patient?",Pituitary biopsy,Reassure and continued observation,Stereotactic pituitary irradiation,Transphenoidal hypophysectomy,Treat with dopamine agonist therapy,B,"This patient has a coincidentally noted pituitary tumour, has no endocrine symptoms, and appears to have normal endocrine function although we are not provided with information pertaining to cortisol secretory function nor growth hormone (GH). With this caveat in mind, the most appropriate strategy would be observation and repeat scanning. "
endocrine system,901,There is a pre-ovulatory surge in the concentration of,Inhibin,Follistatin,Follicle stimulating hormone,GnRH,Progesterone,C,"FOLLICLE-STIMULATING HORMONE (FSH)∙ Gonadotropin - produced by the anterior pituitary gland.∙ Glycoprotein∙ Has an alpha and a beta sub-unit∙ Functions via a receptor on the cell membrane∙ Main function is the stimulation of the growth of 6-12 primary follicles per month∙ Concentartions are low during childhood, increase during puberty and are elevated afterthe menopause∙ Concentrations begin to rise within a few days of the onset of menstruation and then fall asthe oestrogen levels rise. There is a pre-ovulatory surge in FSH concentration∙ Stimulates granulosa cell proliferation and also the ovarian stroma to form the theca internaand externa of the vesicular follicleProduction is regulated by:1) GnRH: from the hypothalamus - stimulates FSH production2) Oestrogen from the ovary - negative feed-back to inhibit pituitary FSH production3) Inhibin: from the ovary - inhibits FSH production 4) Activin: from the ovary - stimulates FSH production5) High levels of progesterone inhibit FSH production"
endocrine system,902,The adrenal medulla produces catecholamines of which,10% is adrenaline and 90% is noradrenaline,85% is adrenaline and 15% is noradrenaline,40% is adrenaline and 60% is noradrenaline,50% is adrenaline and 50% is noradrenaline,85% is noradrenaline and 15% is adrenaline,B,"ADRENAL MEDULLA• Part of the sympathetic nervous system - contains chromaffin cells derived from the neural crest• Produces catecholamines (85% adrenaline, 15% noradrenaline) from tyrosine in associationwith pro-opiomelanocortin and other neuropeptides• Innervated by cholinergic pre-ganglionic fibres of the sympathetic nervous system• Catecholamines are stored within granules in association with ATP and a protein calledchromogranin"
endocrine system,903,"A 56-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with an episode of collapse at home. He had been feeling increasingly tired for the last two months and also reported a loss of libido. He had undergone a transsphenoidal surgery two years ago, followed by external beam radiation for a non-functional pituitary adenoma. He took ramipril 10 mg OD for hypertension. On examination, pulse was 102 beats per minute and regular, BP measured 104/66 mmHg in the lying position, dropping to 80/40 mmHg on standing. Heart sounds were normal. There was no galactorrhoea to expression and testicular volume was normal. Investigations showed:    Serum sodium 129 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 7.2 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 88 µmol/L (60-110)   Serum testosterone 4.5 nmol/L (9-35)   Plasma LH 0.3 U/L (1-10)   Plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone 0.1 mU/L (0.4-5)   Plasma Free T4 7 pmol/L (10-22)   Insulin-like growth factor 15.2 nmol/L (5.6-23.3)   ECG Normal    Which is the next most appropriate investigation?",GHRH-arginine test,Insulin stress test,MRI scan of pituitary,Short Synacthen test,TRH test,D,"The most likely diagnosis in this case is panhypopituitarism induced by cranial irradiation. Patients are classically described to have smooth baby skin and lack of wrinkles, and possibly features of individual hormone deficiencies. Diagnosis is usually aimed at detecting hormone deficiencies. Growth hormone production can be assessed with the insulin stress test or GHRH-arginine stimulation; LH, FSH and oestrogen/testosterone for gonadal function; free T4 for hypothyroidism; and short-synacthen test or insulin stress test for to assess for cortisol production. As replacement with steroids and thyroxine is most critical initially, it is appropriate to test these first. The short-synacthen test is the most appropriate if there has been longstanding hypopituitarism (months duration, as in this case). "
endocrine system,904,A 54-year-old woman presents to the clinic for review. Unfortunately she has carcinoid with extensive hepatic metastases and still has significant diarrhoea and flushing. Which of the following is the initial medical therapy of choice for her?,Bromocriptine,Cabergoline,Interferon alpha,Octreotide,Somatotrophin,D,"Octreotide is a somatostatin analogue which is effective in reducing symptoms of flushing, diarrhoea, hypotension, and abdominal pain which are associated with carcinoid syndrome. Side effects of octreotide therapy include increased risk of gallstones, but in the case of carcinoid, benefits outweigh any risks of potential adverse events. Bromocriptine and cabergoline are dopamine agonists used in the treatment of prolactinomas. Somatotrophin is a growth hormone analogue and as such its use may actually worsen the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Interferon alpha can be used as an adjunct to octreotide in patients with resistant symptoms of carcinoid."
endocrine system,905,A 63-year-old patient who is awaiting review in the respiratory clinic for a possible hilar mass is brought to the Emergency Department for review because of increasing confusion and drowsiness. He has been largely confined to bed for the past three days because of his tiredness. A past history of iron deficiency anaemia and hypertension is noted. He smokes five cigarettes per day. Investigations reveal mild iron deficiency anaemia and an abnormal sodium of 122 mmol/L. Bloods are otherwise normal. Which is the most likely cause of his abnormal chest x ray?,Bronchial carcinoid,Hodgkin's lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Non-small cell lung cancer,Small cell lung cancer,E,"Up to 10% of small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is recognised to be associated with clinical SIADH, although raised ADH levels are actually seen in up to 70% of patients with lung cancer in some case series. The diagnosis of SCLC fits with the position of the mass on CXR and with the past history of smoking. Symptoms resolve in over 80% after initiation of chemotherapy. Bronchial carcinoid may be associated with ADH secretion although it is much more commonly seen in younger patients and is not associated with smoking. Lymphoma is not as common a cause of SIADH as bronchial carcinoma. Cases of SIADH are reported with non-small cell lung tumours, but by far the majority of cases occur in conjunction with SCLC."
endocrine system,906,Primary hyperparathyroidism may occur in association with which of the following conditions?,Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome ,Chronic renal failure (CRF),Gastrinoma ,Sjögren's syndrome,Vitamin D deficiency,C,"The association of primary hyperparathyroidism and a gastrinoma would suggest a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1. CRF causes secondary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism, with vitamin D deficiency causing secondary hyperparathyroidism. There is no association with Sjögren's . Autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome is an autosomal recessive conditon which tends to cause hypoparathyroidism."

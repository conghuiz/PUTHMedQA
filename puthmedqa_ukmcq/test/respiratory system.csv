respiratory system,1,A 19-year-old smoker presents to the Emergency department with right sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea. He has no previous medical history. His BP is 120/75 mmHg. A CXR is done and confirms a right sided pneumothorax with a rim of 2.5 cm. Aspiration was done and was successful. He is about to go on holiday abroad in three days time. Which of the following advice would you give?,Advise not to drive,Advise not to swim,Allow flight but advise not to do any diving,Do not advise any flight for at least one week ideally six,Repeat CXR before the flight and allow if no residual pneumothorax,D,"Atmospheric air drops during flights and increases in deep sea diving can cause recurrence of pneumothorax. This is due to expansion and rupture of pulmonary blebs. Many commercial airlines previously advised a 6-week interval between pneumothorax and air travel, but this has now been amended to 1 week following full resolution. However, the British Thoracic Society emphasises that the recurrence risk only significantly falls after 1 year, and therefore in the absence of a definitive surgical procedure patients might wish to defer travel until then. "
respiratory system,2,Which of the following is true regarding the cricoid cartilage?,A force of 4 Newtons must be applied to the cricoid cartilage to control regurgitation,It represents the narrowest part of the airway in adults,Regurgitation of gastric contents is prevented by the Sellick manoeuvre,The lower border is attached to the first tracheal ring,The upper border is attached to the hyoid bone,D,"In adults, the narrowest part of the airway is at the level of the vocal cords, and in children, it is at the level of the cricoid cartilage. The upper border of the cricoid cartilage is attached to the thyroid cartilage (not hyoid bone), and the lower border is attached to the first tracheal ring. The application of cricoid pressure to control regurgitation (or reduce the risk of aspiration) of gastric contents during the induction of anaesthesia, was described by Sellick in 1961. It does not prevent aspiration into the trachea, and it cannot prevent regurgitation up the oesophagus. To provide protection in most of the adult population, a force of 44 Newtons should be applied to the cricoid cartilage (not 4 Newtons)."
respiratory system,3,A man suffering from Influenza A since 5 days ago. CXR: pneumonia. What organism is responsible for pneumonia in this patient?,Hemophilius influenzae,Klebsiella,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumonia,Pseudomonas,C,Post flue pneumonia is usually caused by staphylococcus aureus
respiratory system,4,"A 25-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department with cough, shortness of breath and headache. He had been treated by his GP with amoxicillin but did not improve. He had recently been on holiday in Spain. On examination he had bilateral crackles. His liver enzymes were deranged. What would be the most useful diagnostic test?",Chest x ray,O2 saturation at rest and on exertion,Viral serology,White cell count,Urinary antigen,E,"Legionella pneumonia is spread via aerosols. It occurs in 2-15% of community acquired pneumonia. It should be suspected in case of foreign travel or stay in hotels, failure to respond to penicillins, diarrhoea accompanying respiratory symptoms, deranged liver function tests and low sodium. The diagnostic test is urinary antigen. One should not wait for the result. Sputum cultures (if productive) are also diagnostic. O2 saturation at rest and desaturation after exertion will help in Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). Chest x ray may show unilateral or bilateral lobar pneumonia and there may be small pleural effusions but this is not diagnostic. WCC may be high or low."
respiratory system,5,A 17-year-old patient with known atopic asthma presents to the Emergency department with an acute asthma attack. He had been over at his friend's house playing with his dog about 10 minutes before he felt wheezy and short of breath. He is given bronchodilators and has a good response. He is discharged later that day following a period of observation with an asthma management plan. Which of the below immunomodulators is involved in this immediate response (bronchoconstriction)?,Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP),Leukotriene C4 (LTC4),Major basic protein (MBP),Platelet activating factor (PAF),TH2 lymphocytes,B,"Inhalation of allergens by individuals with atopic asthma initiates an immediate bronchoconstriction reaction. This usually subsides within two hours and is reversible with bronchodilators. This is an example of type I hypersensitivity and is caused by degranulation of mast cells and release of histamine, prostaglandin D2 and leukotriene C4 and D4. The other immunomodulators listed form part of the late phase (or type IV hypersensitivity) response which results in bronchoconstriction, airways inflammation, hyper-responsiveness and oedema. This typically occurs three to12 hours after the immediate response and is less susceptible to bronchodilators. The increased hypersensitivity may promote recurrent asthma attacks over the following days."
respiratory system,6,A 67-year-old man with known COPD attends the emergency department via ambulance with a severe exacerbation. On arrival the ambulance crew hand over the oxygen alert card provided to him by his local chest clinic. Which of the following pieces of information is listed on the standardised oxygen alert cards?,His previous oxygen saturations (when well),His previous pCO2 reading (when well),His previous pO2 reading (when well),The oxygen concentration via venturi mask to be used,Underlying respiratory condition,D,"The British Thoracic Society in conjunction with the Intensive Care Society has produced oxygen alert cards that can be downloaded and printed to give to patients. The details provided include the patient's name, that they are at risk of type II respiratory failure (with raised CO2 levels), the concentration of oxygen to be delivered via venturi mask and their target oxygen saturations. It also contains advice regarding the use of air and oxygen driven nebuliser machines in such patients. The early identification of at risk patients is essential in avoiding over-oxygenation and precipitating CO2 retention."
respiratory system,7,"A 30-year-old man with AIDS presents with fever, dry cough and dyspnoea, CXR shows diffuse bilateral alveolar and interstitial shadowing beginning in the perihilar regions and spreading outward, What is the SINGLE most likely causative organism?",Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pneumocystis carinii,Aspergillus fumigatus,CMV,Actinomyces israelli,B,"Pneumocystis carinii also known as Pneumocystis jirovecii is a yeast-like fungus. Pneumocystis specimens are commonly found in the lungs of healthy people although it is usually not a cause for disease. However, they are a source of opportunistic infection and can cause lung infections in people with a weak immune system or other predisposing health conditions. PCP is seen in people with HIV/AIDS (who account for 30- 40% of PCP cases), those using medications that suppress the immune system, and people with cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, and chronic lung disease"
respiratory system,8,"A 32-year-old man is admitted by ambulance after being caught up in a house fire and gas explosion whilst trying to rescue a neighbour. He has been resuscitated at the scene, but on arrival in the Emergency department is extremely unwell. His saturations are 91% on a non-rebreather; his BP is 142/82 mmHg with a pulse of 84. There is audible stridor and bibasal crackles on auscultation of the chest. Portable chest is suggestive of pulmonary oedema. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",BIPAP,Intubation and ventilation,IV furosemide,IV nitrate,IV noradrenaline,B,"The suspicion here is that this patient has non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema as a result of smoke inhalation. There is also stridor, a sign of laryngeal oedema and this patient is at significant risk of airway obstruction. As such the optimal management is intubation and ventilation. BIPAP is inappropriate because of the risk of airway obstruction. The other treatments are conventional ones for cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. IV furosemide may help but is not a definitive treatment.  IV noradrenaline is not required with this blood pressure."
respiratory system,9,"A 48 year old farmer presents to his GP. He states that often in the evening following his morning duties of milking the cows and forking hay he feels unwell with a fever, cough, chest tightness and shortness of breath. This then resolves and he feels well again by the morning. On examination he has bibasal inspiratory crackles. A CXR shows diffuse micronodular interstitial shadowing. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute form of Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis,Viral Pneumonia,Chronic form of Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis,Occupational Asthma,Tuberculosis,A,"The history, clinical findings and Xray are indicative of extrinsic allergic alveolitis. This is a diffuse granulomatous inflammation in lung parenchyma and airways following repeated exposure to organic antigens.  In the acute form there is a flu like illness with fever, chest tightness, cough and dyspnoea 4 to 6 hours after exposure.  In the chronic form there is typically fatigue, upper lobe fibrosis and dyspnoea on exertion.  Causes include farmers lung due to mouldy hay exposure as in this case, birds fanciers lung and numerous others.  A CXR may reveal reticulonodular shadowing in sub acute form and upper lobe fibrosis is typical of the chronic form.  Hugh resolution CT and antigen specific IgG antibodies are useful for the diagnosis. In occupational asthma you would expect wheeze but not generally fever or malaise."
respiratory system,10,Which of the following are true of tracheostomy?,Bleeding should be managed by deflating the cuff and removing the tube,Cuffed tubes should be used in children under 8-years-old,It is usually required to wean from a prolonged period of mechanical ventilation,"Open procedure involves division of the thyroid isthmus and vertical incision between the third, fourth and fifth tracheal rings",Removal requires a FiO2less than 24%,C,"There are numerous indications for the formation of a tracheostomy. These include:  The upper airway obstruction To facilitate airway suction, and To decrease the work of breathing and to allow weaning from mechanical ventilation.  Once the decision has been made to go ahead, a tracheostomy may be performed percutaneously or openly. When using the open method, a midline incision is made and the thyroid isthmus divided and ligated, and a vertical incision made between the second, third and fourth tracheal rings (as the formation of windows and flaps increases the risk of stenosis), and the cuff is inflated. However, in children, cuffed tubes should be avoided due to the risk of tracheal stenosis and mucosal ulceration. Bleeding from the tracheotomy wound is also a recognised complication, and best treated by not deflating the cuff or removing the tube (as they help to tamponade the bleeding) but by giving oxygen, ventilating the patient, and gaining IV access, whilst calling for help. Criterion for the removal of tracheostomy tubes: the patient is able to maintain their own airway and ventilate adequately. Indicators of this are: a low inspired oxygen concentration, adequate carbon dioxide elimination, minimal sputum production and that the patient is not heavily sedated and able to co-operate! "
respiratory system,11,"A 33-year-old man has a temperature of 38.5 C, cough and chest pain on the right side on inspiration. He also has purulent sputum. What is the most likely organism to cause pneumonia in this patient?",Gram +ve diplococcic,Coagulase +ve cocci,PCP cold agglutinins,AFB,Gram –ve diplococcic,A,It is a case of community acquired pneumonia caused by streptococcus pneumoniae
respiratory system,12,"A 26-year-old man who works in a car body shop spray painting vehicles comes to the respiratory clinic complaining of increasing shortness of breath and wheeze. He says that he is fine at the end of a weekend off, and particularly well when he goes on holiday, but steadily gets worsening symptoms from Monday to Friday. He is a non-smoker who has no significant past medical history. On examination his BP is 125/75 mmHg, his pulse is 75 and regular. He has significant bilateral wheeze and a non-productive cough. Investigations show    Haemoglobin 149 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 5.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 192 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 140 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 μmol/L (79-118)   PEFR 245 l/min    Which of the following is the best initial way to elucidate any link between the workplace and possible asthma?",Bronchial hyper-responsiveness testing,Radioallergosorbent testing,Serial peak flow measurement including weekdays and weekends,Skin testing,Specific bronchial provocation testing,C,"The most obvious initial investigation is to get the patient to keep a peak flow diary with multiple measurements at different times in the day and involving both weekdays and weekends. Detailed pulmonary function tests, and radioallergosorbent (RAST) or skin testing may also be part of the work up, but the peak flow diary is the best way to establish the temporal relationship between asthma and the paint spraying. Once the specific trigger is identified he may either need to be given special equipment to protect him from exposure, or moved to a different role. Simply treating his asthma with appropriate medication is not appropriate."
respiratory system,13,"A 48-year-old man with a history of cirrhosis comes to the respiratory clinic for a consultation because of increased shortness of breath. He smokes 10 cigarettes per day and has done so since the age of 17. Medication of note includes propranolol, but nil else of note. On examination his BP is 112/70 mmHg, pulse is 62 and regular. Apart from signs of chronic liver disease, you also notice that he has scattered wheeze throughout both lung fields. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 129 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 5.7 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 203 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (60-120)   Chest x ray Evidence of hyperexpanded lung fields   Pulmonary function tests FEV1 55% of predicted   FVC 90% of predicted   Reduced KCO    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Chronic bronchitis,Emphysema,Hypoventilation,Pulmonary fibrosis,C,"This man has hyperexpanded lung fields on CXR, reduced transfer factor and an FEV1/FVC of 61%. Despite smoking a relatively small number of cigarettes he has significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on pulmonary function tests; the reduced transfer factor and CXR appearance pointing towards a predominantly emphysematous picture. The fact that he has cirrhosis raises the possibility of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency as the underlying diagnosis. Pulmonary fibrosis would not show a redcued transfer factor and a restrictive picture.  Hypoventilation would not affect the Tidal Volume Asthma would not affect the transfer factor."
respiratory system,14,A 45-year-old female presents with a six month history of exertional dyspnoea and is diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis (PF). Over the last one year she has received a variety of medications. Which of the following drugs could be responsible?,Dexamethasone,Ibuprofen,Nalidixic acid,Penicillamine,Sulphasalazine,E,"The drugs which can classically cause pulmonary fibrosis include:  Cytotoxics: busulphan, bleomycin, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide, carmustine Antibiotics: e.g. nitrofurantoin Cardiac drugs: hydralazine, amiodarone, tocainide Opiates: e.g. heroin abuse  Sulphasalazine pulmonary toxicity is rare, but is increasingly recognised. It typically presents with new-onset dyspnoea and pulmonary infiltrates visible on chest radiograph. There may be peripheral blood eosinophilia. Histology most commonly demonstrates an eosinophilic pneumonia with interstitial inflammation and fibrosis. Drug withdrawal is standard treatment, with or without the addition of corticosteroids.  Dexamethasone can be used to treat pulmonary fibrosis, and is not a recognised cause. Neither is ibuprofen nor nalidixic acid (a synthetic quinolone antibiotic). Penicillamine is associated with pulmonary toxicity in the form of diffuse alveolar damage, hypersensitivity pneumonitis and obliterative bronchitis. It does not cause pulmonary fibrosis however, and D-penicillamine has actually been shown to stabilse pulmonary fibrosis in the setting of systemic sclerosis."
respiratory system,15,Which of the following is not a contraindication for surgical treatment of a bronchial carcinoma?,Brain metastases,Widespread lymph node involvement,Malignant pleural effusion,FEV1 less than 1.5l,Paraneoplastic syndrome,E,Paraneoplastic syndrome may be present in early bronchial carcinoma which may be amenable to surgical resection.
respiratory system,16,A 25 year old female has an acute asthma attack.  She is tachycardic and is tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 35.  On auscultation she is very wheezy but is beginning to tire.  Her peak flow is about one third of her normal.  She is commenced on both salbutamol and ipratropium nebulisers and IV hydrocortisone and IV magnesium sulphate however has not greatly improved.  Her gases reveal a high normal CO2 level and low normal O2 level on a trauma mask. Which of the following is the next step in her management?,BiPAP,IV aminophylline,CPAP,IV salbutamol,Intubation and ventilation,E,This patient is showing features of a life threatening asthma attack. Anaesthetic help must be sought early. She is clearly failing to respond to maximal medical therapy given a normal CO2 and low O2 and thus the next step is intubation and ventilation. IV salbutamol and IV aminophylline are not routinely recommended and should be commenced by specialists however in this case ventilation is required. CPAP and BiPAP are not appropriate.
respiratory system,17,"A 48-year-old farmer presented with fever, malaise, cough and SOB. Examination: tachypnea, coarse end-inspiratory crackles and wheeze throughout, cyanosis. Also complaint severe weight loss. His CXR shows fluffy nodular shadowing and there is PMN (polymorphonuclear) leukocytosis. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?",Ankylosing spondylitis,Churg-strauss syndrome,Cryptogenic organizing,Extrinsic allergic alveolitis,Progressive massive fibrosis,D,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis) refers to a group of lung diseases in which lungs become inflammed as an allergic reaction resulting from exposure to dusts of animal and vegetable origin. It starts with fever, muscular aches and a general, unwell feeling or malaise. These symptoms are accompanied by tightness in the chest, a dry cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms may develop between 4 and 8 hours after exposure. Chest X-ray shows fluffy nodular shadowing and there is polymorphoneuclear leukocytosis. Treatment of extrinsic allergic alveolitis initially depends on identification of the cause of the allergic reaction. If possible, the patient should avoid exposure to the allergen. In an occupational setting, mild cases may be alleviated by improved ventilation or use of air filtering masks"
respiratory system,18,What happens to the pulmonary vasculature in a patient with pneumonia?,Vasoconstriction of vessels in area of lung with pneumonia and vasoconstriction in normal lung,Vasodilatation of vessels in area of lung with pneumonia and vasodilatation in normal lung,Vasodilatation of vessels in area of lung with pneumonia and vasoconstriction in normal lung,Vasoconstriction of vessels in area of lung with pneumonia and vasodilatation in normal lung,No change,D,"When a pneumonia is present, shunting occurs where there is vasoconstriction to the lung tissue affected by the pneumonia and vasodilatation occurs in the unaffected areas to reduce the blood supply to poorly oxygenated areas."
respiratory system,19,A patient has daytime sleepiness. He wakes up in the morning unrefreshed. He frequently dozes off while watching TV. He is hypertensive but well controlled with amlodipine 5 mg and ramipril 2.5 mg. He occasionally takes paracetamol for back pain. Neurological examination was normal. His BMI is 45. His thyroid function tests were normal as well as IGF-1. Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is suspected. Which of the following would make OSA more likely?,Cataplexy,High Epworth sleepiness score,Low Epworth sleepiness score,Low hypocretin levels in CSF,Witness of snoring during sleep,B,Epworth sleepiness score consists of questions which are marked out of 24. Scores greater than 9 raise the suspicion of the possibility of OSA. It should be interpreted in the context of history. Those with high scores should be referred for further assessment. Capaplexy is the sudden loss of muscle tone while a person is awake.  Low hypocretin levels are often seen in narcolepsy.
respiratory system,20,With which of the following is hypercapnoea associated?,Hypotension,Exhausted soda lime granules,Metabolic acidosis,Respiratory alkalosis,Severe anaemia,B,"Hypercapnoea is defined as an end tidal CO2 over 6 kPa (45 mmHg) and occurs in a respiratory acidosis (not alkalosis). This may be a primary respiratory acidosis, for example:  head injury central nervous system depression spinal cord lesion, and fatigue of respiratory muscles.  A respiratory acidosis may also occur as a compensatory mechanism secondary to a metabolic alkalosis. Increasing hypercapnia results in increased cardiac output and increased blood pressure. Exhausted soda lime granules cause the inspired concentration of carbon dioxide to increase (rebreathing), and are a recognised cause of hypercapnoea. Note that hypercapnoea is an increased ET CO2, and hypercarbia is an increased arterial PCO2."
respiratory system,21,"A 28 year old gentleman has a long history of rhinitis and asthma. However he now presents with haemoptysis. He has also noticed a rash and severe pain which he states feels like sciatica. He is feeling generally unwell with fatigue, myalgia and weight loss. On examination he is hypertensive and there is a purpuric rash. Bloods reveal acute renal failure and elevated inflammatory markers and eosinophil count. Given the most likely diagnosis, which antibody is likely to be present?",Anti Ro,Rheumatoid factor,cANCA,Anti dsDNA,pANCA,E,"The most likely diagnosis is Churg Strauss syndrome. There is three phases. Often there is a history of allergic rhinitis and asthma followed by eosinophilic infiltrative disease with pneumonia or gastroenteritis and the vasculitis. The vasculitic disease can produces many symptoms in different organs such as mononeuritis multiplex, glomerulonephritis, GI symptoms such as pain or haemorrhage, cardiovascular involvement such as heart failure and skin changes such as purpura or livedo reticularis. Haemoptysis may occur due to infiltrative disease. It is associated with the autoantibody pANCA/antimyeloperoxidase antibodies. RF is seen in Rheumatoid arthritis, anti dsDNA in SLE and anti Ro in Sjogrens or SLE. cANCA is observed in Wegeners granulomatosis."
respiratory system,22,"A 69-year-old lady is seen in chest clinic for her increasing breathlessness. She has a significant smoking history having smoked 40/day for 50 years. When questioned she reports that she notices that she has to walk slower than her husband and friends due to her breathlessness. When walking at her own pace she often stops every 300 m, again due to breathlessness. What grade of dyspnoea does she have accordingly to the MRC dyspnoea scale?",Grade I,Grade II,Grade III,Grade IV,Grade V,C,"One of the main symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is breathlessness and the MRC dyspnoea scale should be used to quantify this.    Grade Degree of breathlessness related to activities   1 Not troubled by breathlessness except on strenuous exercise   2 Short of breath when hurrying or walking up a slight hill   3 Walks slower than contemporaries on level ground because of breathlessness, or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace   4 Stops for breath after walking about 100 metres or after a few minutes on level ground   5 Too breathless to leave the house, or breathless when dressing or undressing    "
respiratory system,23,"A 65-year-old man presents with significant weight loss and complains of cough, SOB and chest pain. Exam: left pupil constricted, drooping of left eyelid. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pancoast tumor,Thoracic outlet syndrome,Cervical rib,Pneumonia,Bronchogenic ca,A,Pancoast tumour is the apical lung cancer that is associated with destructive lesions of the thoracic inlet and involvement of the brachial plexus and cervical sympathetic nerves (the stellate ganglion) leading to horner’s syndrome
respiratory system,24,"A 23-year-old man presents to the Emergency department with sudden onset left sided pleuritic chest pain. He has had a cough over the past few days and says the pain came on after a coughing fit. On examination his BP is 148/82 mmHg, pulse is 82 and regular, his saturations are 95% on air. Chest sounds appear normal. Investigations show:    pH 7.42 (7.35-7.45)   pCO2 4.8 kPa (4.8-6.1)   pO2 10.2 kPa (10-13.3)   CXR Small left sided pneumothorax (less than5%)    What is the most appropriate management?",Admit for overnight oxygen therapy,Chest drain,Discharge and review in 24 hours,Discharge and review in the clinic in two to three weeks,Pleural aspiration,D,"This man has a small pneumothorax without significant hypoxia. There is nothing in his history or examination to suggest a sinister cause for his pneumothorax, as such conservative management with review in the clinic in two to three weeks is most appropriate. This spontaneous pneumothorax is primary (defined as age less than 50, no significant smoking history, and no evidence of underlying lung disease). Management depends on the size, and the patient's symptoms. If it is small (as in this case) the patient can be discharged and reviewed in an outpatient clinic in 2-4 weeks. If the rim of air measures more than 2 cm at the level of the hilum, and/or the patient is breathless the pneumothorax can be aspirated. A chest drain is indicated if aspiration fails in a large or symptomatic primary pneumothorax. They can also be used in the management of secondary pneumothorax. Supplemental oxygen accelerates reabsorption of air by a factor of four, but overnight treatment does not feature as part of the current UK guidelines in small primary pneumothoraces. "
respiratory system,25,A 68 year old male presents with increasing shortness of breath and chest pain. On examination there is reduced air entry on the left to the mid zone and dullness to percussion. A Chest Xray reveals a left side pleural effusion. There is history of previous asbestos exposure. Which investigation will be most useful in providing the definitive diagnosis?,Pleural Tap and cytological analysis,Chest drain,Pleural Ultrasound,Pleural Biopsy,CT Chest,D,"In any patient with previous asbestos exposure, who presents with a pleural effusion and chest pain then Mesothelioma should be suspected. An ultrasound and CT chest may show evidence of pleural thickening and loculation and other features of asbestos exposure however it will not provide the definitive diagnosis. Cytological analysis of pleural fluid from aspiration may provide the diagnosis but there is a low chance and therefore pleural biopsy is normally required to provide the diagnosis. This is normally done under ultrasound or CT guide. Thoracoscopy which allows drainage of fluid, biopsy and pleurodesis is becoming increasingly available and may also be utilised."
respiratory system,26,"A 25-year-old woman is admitted with a four month history of cough productive of mucoid sputum streaked with bright red blood, wheezing and diarrhoea. Her chest and abdominal examination are normal. Which of the following investigations is the most discriminatory?",Bronchoscopy,Chest x ray,Computed tomography (CT) of chest ,Echocardiogram,Ventilation-perfusion scan,A,"This presentation is classical of a carcinoid tumour. These are neuroendocrine tumours of predominantly enterochromaffin cell origin. They can occur in the small intestine, bronchi, rectum appendix or stomach. Those in the lung are most often located in the main bronchi, and occur most frequency in the right middle lobe. Often, carcinoid tumours are asymptomatic but they can secrete a number of vasoactive compounds (including serotonin and bradykinin), which result in the carcinoid syndrome characterised by bronchospasm, diarrhoea, skin flushing and right-sided valvular heart lesions. Development of the carcinoid syndrome depends on the location of the tumour, and the presence of metastases. Bronchoscopy identifies up to 80% of carcinoid tumours in the main bronchi. Bronchial carcinoid is seen as a highly vascular 'cherry-like' tumour causing recurrent haemoptysis and bronchial obstruction. Biopsy is usually followed with brisk bleeding and should be done via rigid bronchoscopy. Plasma chromograffin A is an effective screening test for carcinoid as it is very sensitive, but it is not specific. 24 hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is more specific for the diagnosis, but false positives and negatives are present. CT, VQ scans and chest radiographs can demonstrate carcinoid tumours of the lung, but cannot accurately differentiate between other forms of mass in the lung (for example bronchial carcinoma). Scintigraphic imaging with labelled somatostatin increases the ability to diagnose a carcinoid tumour, but biopsy is required to confirm. Echocardiogram can demonstrate valvular lesions which suggest carcinoid syndrome, but this will not help to localise the lesion."
respiratory system,27,"A 28-year-old man who works on a local mushroom farm comes to the clinic with increased shortness of breath. In addition to feeling increasingly short of breath, he has suffered intermittent fevers and sweats over the past few months. On examination his BP is 135/72 mmHg, pulse is 72 and regular. There are fine inspiratory crackles at both bases on auscultation of his chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 135 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 9.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 204 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 116 µmol/L (79-118)    Chest x ray shows diffuse interstitial shadowing. Spirometry shows mixed restrictive/obstructive picture. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for the longer term?",Change of job plan,Inhaled anticholinergics,Inhaled high dose Seretide,Oral prednisolone,Regular azithromycin,A,"This man's occupation as a mushroom picker raises the possibility of mushroom picker's lung, a form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Optimal management is removal of exposure to the antigen, although in the short term a course of oral corticosteroids is likely to be appropriate. Inhaled anticholinergics are used in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and are therefore not appropriate here. Inhaled corticosteroids are not as effective as oral corticosteroids in managing subacute or chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, so oral prednisolone is the treatment of choice after removal of exposure to the antigen has occurred. There is no role for antibiotic therapy."
respiratory system,28,A 38-year-old man presents with episodic wheeze and non-productive cough which occurs particularly at night. He has been employed in the plastics industry. Which of the following suggests a diagnosis of occupational lung disease?,Absent family history of asthma,Commencement of symptoms on his first day in this employment,Elevated serum IgE concentration,Improved symptomatology when on holiday,Increased bronchial reactivity,D,"Episodic cough and wheeze with nocturnal symptoms are classical of asthma. Occupational asthma is the commonest industrial lung disease with over 400 causes and accounts for up to 10% of adult onset asthma. The commonest occupations affected are spray painters, bakers, chemical processors, plastics workers and welders and soldering. Patients are characteristically better when on holiday. The diagnosis is confirmed by serial peak expiratory flow (PEF) measurements at home and at work. Recordings should be performed two hourly for four weeks or if this is not possible metacholine/histamine challenges can be undertaken after days at work and away from work. The importance of keeping a diary of when symptoms are worse and improve can aid the diagnosis.  Following objective confirmation of the diagnosis the underlying cause should be identified."
respiratory system,29,"A 55-year-old man has weight loss, dyspnea and syncope. He smokes 20 cigarettes a day. Investigation confirms squamous cell carcinoma in the left bronchus. What is the single most important likely biochemical abnormality to be associated with the condition?",Hyperkalaemia,Hypercalcaemia,Hypernatremia,Hypocalcemia,Hypomagnesemia,B,"The main pathogenesis of hypercalcemia in malignancy is increased osteoclastic bone resorption. Enhanced bone resorption in malignancy is mainly secondary to different humoral factors released by tumour cells locally or systemically. The main humoral factor is parathyroid hormone related protein produced by many solid tumours. It increases calcium by activating parathyroid hormone receptors in tissue, which result in osteoclastic bone resorption. It also increases renal tubular resorption of calcium"
respiratory system,30,"A 37-year-old lady with well controlled asthma since a teenager presents with a six week history of gradually worsening asthma, sinusitis, weight loss, and fatigue. On examination, there is scattered wheeze bilaterally, and there is a non-blanching petechial rash on the shin. Muscle strength is normal. Recent blood tests show:    Haemoglobin 111 g/L (115-165)   WBC 14.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 60% (40-75)   Lymphocytes 10% (20-45)   Eosinophils 30% (1-6)   Platelet 270 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 86 mm/hr (0-20)   CRP 143 mg/L (less than10)   Anti-myeloperoxidase antibody Positive   pANCA Positive   cANCA Negative   Urea, electrolytes andamp; creatinine Normal    What is the diagnosis?",Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA),Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Eosinophilic pneumonia,B,"EGPA is a rare form of small vessel vasculitis, characterised by asthma, allergic rhinitis and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia. All of these are present in the history and should lead you to the diagnosis of EGPA The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. EGPA, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The unifying feature of patients presenting with EGPA is asthma. Vasculitis involving the peripheral nervous system is also a characteristic feature, and mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 75% of patients. Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with EGPA. Forty per cent to 60% are associated with positive ANCA, usually pANCA/MPO. ANCA are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Several different staining patterns and antigen specificities are recognised. The cytoplasmic staining pattern, cANCA, and specificity for the PR3 antigen is most specific for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Perinuclear staining, pANCA, and/or antibody to MPO are far less specific than cANCA and can be present in a range of inflammatory conditions such as microscopic polyangitis, EGPA and Goodpasture's syndrome. MPO and pANCA may also be present in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome and occasionally in chronic infections. Intravenous glucocorticoid is used for initial therapy of acute multi-organ involvement in EGPA, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy, often with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent. Loss of vision is rare but can occur and must be treated aggressively. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is a hypersensitivity reaction to Aspergillus. Its clinical presentation varies from corticosteroid-dependent asthma to diffuse bronchiectasis with fibrosis. Visual loss is not an associated feature. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and a small vessel vasculitis. A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is characterised by a peripheral blood eosinophil count of greater than1.5 for more than six months. Generalised symptoms are fatigue, myalgia, fever, night sweats, diarrhoea and pruritus. Other symptoms depend on the organ involved: cardiac disease causes chest pain and dyspnoea, respiratory disease presents with a dry cough. "
respiratory system,31,"A 62-year-old man presents with cough, breathlessness and wheeze. 24% O2, salbutamol and hydrocortisone were given.

Streptococcus pneumoniae predominates in community-acquired cases, (those who are not hospitalized- as for presenting case) and Staphylococcus aureus and Gram negative organisms predominate in hospital-acquired cases"
respiratory system,33,Which of the following would be the least likely finding in a patient with sarcoidosis?,Hepatic granulomas,Restrictive pulmonary function tests,Skin lesions,Uveitis,X bodies on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid,E,"Sarcoidosis is associated with:  Uveitis Arthritis Pulmonary fibrosis Lymphadenopathy and Skin changes - lupus pernio/erythema nodosum.  It is characterised histologically by the presence of non-caseating granulomas which may occur anywhere. These granulomas have the capacity to produce 1,25 vitamin D explaining the associated hypercalcaemia. Pentalaminar X bodies (Birbeck granules) found on BAL are considered diagnostic of pulmonary histiocytosis X and so would not be expected with sarcoidosis."
respiratory system,34,"A 68-year-old man who has a 40 year smoking history comes to the surgery complaining of haemoptysis which he describes as coughing up an egg cup full of pink/red frothy sputum on three occasions over the past month. He has had a chronic cough over the past few months, and has lost 5 kg in weight. On examination his BP is 155/90 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular. There is occasional wheeze on auscultation of his chest consistent with COPD. Investigations including a chest x ray are reported as normal, apart from a raised ESR of 70. What is the next step?",Co-amoxiclav,Refer for bronchoscopy,Refer for CT thorax,Salbutamol,Seretide,C,"In 30% of cases of haemoptysis, the initial CXR is reported as normal. However, given that the patient is a heavy smoker, has lost weight and has a chronic cough, further investigations are definitely warranted. At this stage a CT would be most logical as opposed to proceeding straight to bronchoscopy. Treatments for a presumed respiratory tract infection, or for COPD, without ruling out an underlying cancer would be unwise in this situation. A bronchoscopy may be required but this will be after a CT. Salbutamol and seretide may help with symptoms but not help diagnose the underlying cause. Co-amoxiclav will not aid the diagnosis."
respiratory system,35,"A 24-year-old woman presents to the respiratory clinic some nine months after the birth of her first child. She has suffered increasing shortness of breath over the past few weeks and months, so much so that she can barely walk up stairs or to the bus stop at the end of her street. On examination she looks short of breath at rest. Her JVP is elevated and there is mild bilateral ankle swelling. Her lung fields are clear. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 132 g/L (115-160)   White cell count  7.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 201 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 116 µmol/L (79-118)    Echocardiogram shows evidence of pulmonary hypertension. VQ scan shows no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management?",Beta blocker,Calcium antagonist,Endothelin receptor antagonist,PDE-5 inhibitor,Prostaglandin infusion,C,"This woman has primary pulmonary hypertension, which often presents in women after the birth of the first child. Calcium antagonists form the basis of initial therapy only for those patients without right sided heart failure, therefore an endothelin receptor antagonist would be initial therapy of choice. Examples of endothelin receptor antagonists include bosentan and ambrisentan. They significantly reduce pulmonary artery pressure, but adverse effects include peripheral oedema and liver function test monitoring is recommended. Beta blockers are not recommended in the management of primary pulmonary hypertension as their major effect is on reducing peripheral blood pressure. Calcium antagonists are effective in only 10-15% of patients and only recommended if there is no right sided heart failure. Phosphodiesterase Type 5 (PDE-5) inhibitors are used in mild disease, or in stage III or IV NYHA functional status in combination with endothelin receptor antagonists. Nebulised or subcutaneous prostacyclin analogues are less convenient than oral options and tend to be reserved for combination with oral therapy."

Chronic venous thromboembolism would be the most likely explanation for this man's presentation. Hyperventilation would be excluded by the type 1 respiratory failure, an inhaled foreign body would not produce such a picture and an atypical pneumonia would be associated with pyrexia and some clinical signs. The differential diagnosis here is pulmonary fibrosis but basal crackles may be expected and the history is somewhat short."

Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as symptoms and signs consistent with an acute lower respiratory tract infection associated with new radiological signs consistent with consolidation, not explained by another cause. The severity of each case of CAP should be assessed using the CURB-65 tool in conjunction with clinical judgement. Patients score 1 point for each of:  Confusion Urea greater than7 mmol/L Respiratory rate ≥30/min Blood pressure: systolic less than90 or diastolic ≤60 mmHg Age ≥65 years  A CURB-65 score of 0 or 1 are at low risk of death, and can be treated at home if the social circumstances are compatible. A score of 2 usually indicates inpatient treatment is required, but hospital-supervised outpatient treatment can be considered. Patients who have a CURB-65 score of 3 or more are at high risk of death. Those with scores of 4 and 5 should be considered for treatment in a critical care unit (HMU, ITU). In the majority of patients CAP should be confirmed by chest radiography before the commencement of antibiotics. However, if patients are critically unwell they should be treated for the presumptive diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment should be initiated within 4 hours of presentation. Low severity CAP (CURB 0-1) can be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg TDS PO. CURB 2 CAP should be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg-1 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg TDS. Alternatives are available if patients are allergic to any of the above combinations. High severity CAP (CURB 3-5) should be treated as soon as possible with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. The oral route is recommended in those with low and moderate severity CAP. Patients treated with parenteral antibiotics initially should be switched to an oral regimen once clinical improvement is seen and the patients has been afebrile for at least 24 hours. For most patients with uncomplicated CAP 7 days of antibiotic treatment is recommended. For those with high severity pneumonia where an organism has not been identified, 7-10 days treatment is indicated and extended to 14-21 days where clinically needed. "

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Avian influenza,Legionnaire's disease,Psittacosis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Q fever,C,"There are a number of signs and investigations that support a diagnosis of psittacosis in this patient. Relative bradycardia with non-specific chest signs, coupled with diffuse chest x ray changes, a low white count and abnormal LFTs are consistent with the disease. Tetracyclines are the antibiotics of choice. Avian influenza occurs in epidemics, and as yet H5N1, the strain thought most likely to lead to a human epidemic, has not acquired the ability to spread rapidly between individuals. Q fever is mainly transmitted by ticks and legionnaire's disease by contaminated air conditioning systems. Given the history of bird keeping and the diffuse consolidation seen, psittacosis is more likely than streptococcal pneumonia."

On examination his skin is blue grey in colour, his pulse is 100 and regular, and his BP is 105/60 mmHg. He is unconscious, respiratory examination is unremarkable apart from an increased respiratory rate of 31. The pulse oximeter reads 90%. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Ascorbic acid,Cimetidine,Hyperbaric oxygen,Methylene blue,Omeprazole,D,"Amyl nitrite is known to lead to oxidation of haemoglobin, particularly when ingested in large quantities. The presentation seen here is typical of that for methaemoglobinaemia, when oxidation of the Fe2+ component of haemoglobin to Fe3+ leads to a significant left shift in the oxygen dissociation curve. Methylene blue is the initial treatment of choice for methaemoglobinaemia. Ascorbic acid may be considered as a second line therapy to reduce cyanosis in methaemoglobinaemia although some debate exists as to its efficacy. Cimetidine can be used to inhibit metabolism of agents such as dapsone which are known to lead to methaemoglobinaemia. Hyperbaric oxygen is used for cases which are resistant to initial medical therapy. Omeprazole is not thought to have a role in the treatment of the condition."

Which of the listed values of mean arterial pressure taken at rest is the lowest value associated with a diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension?",greater than10 mmHg,greater than14 mmHg,greater than18 mmHg,greater than20 mmHg,greater than25 mmHg,E,"Pulmonary hypertension is defined as a mean pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure of more than 25 mmHg at rest or more than 30 mmHg during exercise. The normal value is 14 mmHg. A rise in PA pressure can be due to increased pulmonary vascular resistance (for example, embolism or hypoxia), pulmonary blood flow and back pressure (as seen in left heart failure). It is most commonly caused by another disorder (secondary PH). However it may be a disorder of the pulmonary circulation itself (pulmonary arterial hypertension), although this is less common."

There is decreased air entry and dullness to percussion on the side affected. A substantial proportion of the child's blood volume may be contained in the chest and may lead to circulatory shock. Intravenous volume replacement is necessary and insertion of a large bore chest drain. The indication for thoracotomy in haemothorax is a chest drain output greater than 1000 ml in total, or an ongoing loss of greater than 100 ml per hour."

Examination reveals that she is hypoxic, with her oxygen saturations falling still when she is asked to walk. A departmental chest x ray demonstrates bilateral infiltrates. What is the most appropriate antibiotic treatment for this patient given the likely diagnosis?",Amphotericin,Clindamycin and primaquine,Pentamide,"Rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide",Co-trimoxazole,E,"This patient is immunocompromised and given the clinical history and radiological findings, the likely diagnosis in this lady is PCP (Pneumocystis pneumonia). She is also pregnant which affects treatment choice. Although Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) is officially a fungal infection it does not respond to anti-fungal medications. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole/Septrin) has been shown to be as effective as intravenous pentamidine and more effective than other alternative treatment regimens. Co-trimoxazole is the preferred initial therapy during pregnancy according to consensus guidelines. The BNF states that there is a teratogenic risk in the first trimester (as trimethoprim is a folate antagonist), and neonatal haemolysis and methaemoglobinaemia in the third trimester. However, there is also considerable risk of harm to the foetus if the mother is unwell. The benefits in this situation therefore outweigh the risks, and it should be used. For the treatment of infections that are resistant to Co-trimoxazole, the combination of clindamycin and primaquine is likely to be more effective than intravenous pentamidine^1.  Rifampicin, ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide are the first line drugs to treat tuberculosis (TB). Although this woman is at risk from TB infection, the clinical history is more in keeping with a diagnosis of PCP. Adjuvant steroid therapy is indicated in patients with severe PCP infection who have underlying HIV infection. "

Acclimatisation results in increased Hb total content with erythrocytosis. The MCHC will not change as the Hb and haemtocrit should both rise and therefore the calculation will balance.  MCHC = Hb / (Hct/100)  Periodic respiration is a feature of non-acclimatisation. Respiration is normal when subjects are acclimatised to altitude as is cardiac output. Pulmonary artery pressure increases in an effort to oxygenate more blood. 2,3-DPG increases. "

Bloods reveal an elevated CRP and WCC. A CXR reveals hyperinflation of the lungs and an ECG sinus tachycardia. Which investigation should be organised to confirm the diagnosis?",CT Pulmonary Angiogram,CT Chest,D-dimers,Ventilation perfusion scan,ABGs,A,The history and clinical findings are indicative of a pulmonary embolus. Auscultation does not reveal crepitations and CXR shows no consolidation making infection less likely. A CTPA rather than VQ scan should be organised as there is underlying lung disease. D-dimers are likely to be positive and are not specific. D-dimers should only be performed if there is not a high clinical suspicion. ABGs will not provide a diagnosis although are important to guide treatment.
respiratory system,52,Which of the following factors are taken into account in the APACHE II scoring system?,Alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient,Oral temperature,Patient's sex,Platelet count,Serum urea,A,"The APACHE II score is a form of physiological scoring system which devises a score by taking the following three factors into consideration:  Acute physiological score Age of the patient Previous health condition.

According to NICE guidelines, what is the first choice treatment in eligible patients with this stage of NSCLC in whom surgery is not appropriate?",Chemotherapy,Chemotherapy and radical radiotherapy,Radical radiotherapy,Palliation,Symptomatic management including palliative RT,B,"Sequential chemo-radiotherapy should be offered to patients with stage III NSCLC who are not suitable for surgery but are eligible for radical radiotherapy. Surgery alone should be the first line option for patients with stage I and II provided there are no medical contraindications and they have adequate lung function. Radical radiotherapy is indicated for patients with stage I, II or III NSCLC who have good performance status (WHO 0, 1) and whose disease can be encompassed in a radiotherapy treatment volume without undue risk of normal tissue damage. Symptomatic treatment should be considered as the most appropriate management in patients with stage IV disease and poor WHO performance status. The NICE guidelines are just that, and treatment decisions will be based on clinical status and performance status of the patient. "

His housemates are contacted by public health and requested to undergo screening. Which of the following investigations is most commonly used in this instance?,Blood test,Chest x ray,Heaf test,Mantoux test,Microbiology (sputum),D,"The Mantoux test is the most commonly used screening test for contacts of a patient with recently diagnosed TB. If this suggests a risk of infection, then a chest x ray is performed and appropriate follow up arranged. Heaf tests are now less commonly used as a screening test. Blood tests may indicate anaemia, hyponatraemia or hypercalcaemia, which are sometimes seen in infection, but would not have a role in screening.

They may occur one to three days following a fracture and are more common in closed fractures on the long bones or pelvis. The clinical features of fat emboli are predominately:  Pulmonary (shortness of breath, hypoxia) Neurological (confusion and agitation) Dermatological (petechiae), and Haematological (thrombocytopenia, anaemia).  The petechial rash is pathognomonic of this syndrome, but occurs in only 30-50% of cases."
respiratory system,58,"Based on the current British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines, which is the first line empiric antibiotic therapy regime for patients with moderate severity community acquired pneumonia (CAP) based on a CURB-65 score of 2?",Amoxicillin 500 mg TDS,Amoxicillin 1 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD,Benzylpenicillin 1.2 g QDS and levofloxacin 500 mg BD,Co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD,Doxycycline 200 mg loading dose and then 100 mg OD,B,"Community acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as symptoms and signs consistent with an acute lower respiratory tract infection associated with new radiological signs consistent with consolidation, not explained by another cause. The severity of each case of CAP should be assessed using the CURB-65 tool in conjunction with clinical judgement. Patients score 1 point for each of:  Confusion Blood urea nitrogen 7 mmol/L Respiratory rate ≥30/min Blood pressure: systolic less than90 or diastolic ≤60 mmHg Age ≥65 years  A CURB-65 score of 0 or 1 are at low risk of death, and can be treated at home if the social circumstances are compatible. A score of 2 usually indicates inpatient treatment is required, but hospital-supervised outpatient treatment can be considered. Patients who have a CURB-65 score of 3 or more are at high risk of death. Those with scores of 4 and 5 should be considered for treatment in a critical care unit (HMU, ITU). In the majority of patients CAP should be confirmed by chest radiography before the commencement of antibiotics. However, if patients are critically unwell they should be treated for the presumptive diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment should be initiated within 4 hours of presentation. Low severity CAP (CURB 0-1) can be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg TDS PO. CURB 2 CAP should be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg-1 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. Alternatives are available if patients are allergic to any of the above combinations. High severity CAP (CURB 3-5) should be treated as soon as possible with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. The oral route is recommended in those with low and moderate severity CAP. Patients treated with parenteral antibiotics initially should be switched to an oral regimen once clinical improvement is seen and the patients has been afebrile for at least 24 hours. For most patients with uncomplicated CAP 7 days of antibiotic treatment is recommended. For those with high severity pneumonia where an organism has not been identified, 7-10 days treatment is indicated and extended to 14-21 days where clinically needed. "
respiratory system,59,"You review a 52-year-old gentleman with COPD in chest clinic three weeks after a recent admission for an exacerbation. He has had repeated admissions to hospital with exacerbations of his COPD, but until now has refused to quit smoking. He now reports that he is keen to quit smoking and is requesting help to achieve this. Which of the following smoking cessation methods is most likely to be successful in this patient?",Acupuncture,Bupropion plus counselling,Counselling,Hypnosis,Nicotine replacement patches plus counselling,E,"Research has shown that medication to relieve nicotine cravings (such as nicotine patches or bupropion) coupled with counselling has the greatest potential of success, although rates of cessation are only 20%. Bupropion is contraindicated in patients with eating disorders or a history of seizures. It should also be avoided in patients also taking corticosteroids, antimalarials, tramadol and antidepressants, as these lower seizure threshold. Our patient is likely to be on corticosteroids at regular intervals. Acupuncture success rates are between 5-15%, but the evidence for hypnosis is limited."

respiratory system,70,"A 48-year-old woman presented with shortness of breath, cough with heavy sputum production, and a low grade fever. She has smoked 20 cigarettes per day for 30 years. Her arterial blood gases revealed:    pH 7.4 7.36-7.44   pCO2 6 kPa (4.5-6)   pO2 7.9 kPa (8-12)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bronchial asthma,Chronic bronchitis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Paraneoplastic syndrome,Pulmonary embolism,B,The most likely explanation based on the symptoms and the relative hypoxia with high pCO2 is an acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) - towards the chronic bronchitic end of the spectrum.
respiratory system,71,A 65 year old male with COPD presents with an acute exacerbation.  He is commenced on salbutamol and ipratropium nebulisers and given IV hydrocortisone.  However blood gases reveal a pO2 of 8.0 kPa and a pCO2 of 10.0 kPa and a pH of 7.2.  What is the next appropriate step in management?,CPAP,IV Doxapram,Intubation for ventilation,BiPAP,Reduce O2 therapy,D,The next appropriate step would be non invasive ventilation with BiPAP being utilised due to the high CO2 and respiratory acidosis to aim to blow off CO2.  If the patient had not been hypoxic or acidotic then reducing O2 and repeat gases may have been appropriate.  CPAP is not appropriate due to the elevated PCO2.  IV doxapram is only considered if NIV is not appropriate.
respiratory system,72,A 47-year-old gentleman presents to the Emergency department with right sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea. He has no previous medical history. He has no history of smoking. His BP is 120/75 mmHg. A CXR is done and confirms a right sided pneumothorax with a rim of 2.5 cm. What is the best plan of action?,Advise to stop smoking and discharge,Aspirate,Check arterial blood gases and only if hypoxic aspirate,Insert a chest drain,Repeat the CXR in two hours,B,"This gentleman has a spontaneous pneumothorax. It is primary, defined as:  age less than 50-years-old no significant smoking history, and no evidence of underlying lung disease.  Management depends on the size, and the patient's symptoms. If it is small the patient can be discharged and reviewed in an outpatient clinic in 2-4 weeks. If the rim of air measures more than 2 cm at the level of the hilum, as in this case, and/or the patient is breathless the pneumothorax can be aspirated. The level of hypoxia is not a criteria alone to decide management. A chest drain is indicated if aspiration fails in a large or symptomatic primary pneumothorax. They can also be used in the management of secondary pneumothorax. Supplemental oxygen accelerates reabsorption of air by a factor of four, but overnight treatment does not feature as part of the current UK guidelines in small primary pneumothoraces. Repeating the chest radiograph in two hours without any other intervention is unlikely to show any change. The patient should be advised to stop smoking, as this will increase the risk of recurrence and may lead to the development of other lung disease. "
respiratory system,73,A 55-year-old man who has a 25 year pack history of smoking presents with a productive cough with mucoid sputum of two year duration. On examination he has scattered coarse crackles and wheezing. Which of the following is the likeliest diagnosis?,Bronchial asthma,Bronchiectasis,Chronic bronchitis,Pneumonitis,Pulmonary fibrosis,C,Chronic bronchitis is one of the most common respiratory diseases due to cigarette smoking. Both the smoking history and productive cough for at least two years are indicative of chronic bronchitis. Asthma leads to wheeze without crackles.  Bronchiectasis would be associated with reccurent infection and large volumes of purulent sputum.  Pneumonitis and fibrosis would be associated with fine crackles often without wheeze leading to a restrictive picture on lung function tests.
respiratory system,74,Each of the the following conditions can cause a pleural effusion. Which of these would typically cause a transudate (less than30 mg/L protein)?,Mesothelioma,Metastatic pancreatic cancer,Nephrotic syndrome,Pneumonia,Sub-phrenic abscess,C,"All inflammatory and malignant causes of pleural effusions are exudates (greater than30 mg/L protein).

respiratory system,75,Which of the following is correct regarding surgical resection of a squamous cell bronchogenic carcinoma in a 64-year-old man?,An FEV1 of 2 L is a major contraindication to surgical resection,In the presence of finger clubbing indicates that liver metastases are already present,Is precluded if a CT scan of the thorax shows enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes,Positive sputum cytology excludes the need for bronchoscopic examination of the airways,With associated hypercalcaemia makes further assessment for surgery unnecessary,C,"Patients are clearly operable on the basis of spirometry if FEV1 is greater than 1.5 litres for lobectomy and greater than 2 litres for pneumonectomy. Those with worse spirometric function may need full pulmonary function including transfer factor, and exercise testing. Finger clubbing is related to hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) which is a non-metastatic manifestation of malignancy. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is usually associated with a poor prognosis although there may be a role for surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy in those with metastases to ipsilateral mediastinal lymph nodes and subcarinal lymph nodes (N2). Bronchoscopy is useful to identify involvement of carina or if tumour is within 2 cm of the carina, which means the cancer is inoperable. Hypercalcaemia may be associated with parathyroid hormone-related peptide production associated with squamous cell carcinoma (non-metastatic manifestation of malignancy)."

respiratory system,77,A 55 year old gentleman presents to his GP with haemoptysis.  He had a previous history of tuberculosis.  He has a cough and feels fevered at times.  A chest xray reveals a cavitating lesion in the left upper lobe.  Bloods reveal an elevated aspergillus precipitins.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Bronchial carcinoma,Aspergilloma,Chronic necrotising aspergillosis,Pneumonia,Tuberculosis,B,"The most likely diagnosis is aspergilloma. It often presents with haemoptysis and a cavitating lesion occurs where there has been previous cavitating lung disease such as tuberculosis and therefore most commonly found in upper lobes. Fever and cough are less common. Chronic necrotising aspergillosis is rare, the patient is normally immunocompromised and it presents like an indolent pneumonia and haemoptysis is less common."
respiratory system,78,A 26-year-old patient presented to the Emergency department with severe shortness of breath. His BP drops to 80/50 mmHg. He is tachycardic and apyrexial. His O2 sat is 74%. Examination has revealed raised JVP and trachea deviated to the left side. What is the immediate next step?,Aspirate left side of chest using a large bore cannula,Insert a chest drain on the left side,Insert a chest drain on the right side,Request an urgent portable CXR and administer high flow O2 while waiting,Request urgent arterial blood gases,C,"Pneumothorax can be classified as either primary or secondary. However, more important in this case is the presence of tension. Tension pneumothorax results from progressive build-up of air within the pleural space, which is not able to return. This build-up of pressure pushes the mediastinum to the opposite hemithorax and obstructs venous return. The patient then develops severe breathlessness, hypotension, mediastinal shift and, ultimately, cardiac arrest (often electromechanical dissociation: PEA). The classical signs of a tension pneumothorax are deviation of the trachea away from the side of tension, hyper-expanded chest that moves minimally with respiration and increased percussion note. JVP may be raised. However, more commonly the only signs are tachycardia, tachypnoea and hypoxia. Management of tension pneumothorax is immediate chest decompression with needle thoracostomy. A 14-16G intravenous cannula is inserted into the second rib space in the mid-clavicular line, on the side of the pneumothorax. By acting as a valve, this converts a tension pneumothorax into a simple pneumothorax. Definitive treatment of a tension pneumothorax is chest drain insertion. This is usually done in the Emergency Department with ultrasound guidance. Once the pleura is entered, the tension is relieved and the remainder of the procedure can be undertaken with less time pressure. In this case, the option of needle thoracostomy is on the incorrect side, so the correct option is inserting a chest drain on the right side. High-flow oxygen is indicated whilst performing this, and chest x ray should be ordered to check the position of the drain. Arterial blood gases may be indicated once the drain is in situ. Although the above explanation remains correct for the MRCP examination, it is important to be aware that there has been discussion about the use of needle thoracostomy in the medical literature. It has been shown that on occasion it is ineffective in relieving a tension pneumothorax, especially in patients who have very thick chest walls. In addition they are prone to blockage, kinking and dislodging, and can cause a lung laceration which subsequently can lead to air embolisation (especially if a pneumothorax was not present). Some groups are therefore recommending an urgent chest x ray if there is no haemodynamic compromise. "
respiratory system,79,A 19-year-old smoker presents to the Emergency department with right sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea. He has no previous medical history. His BP is 120/75 mmHg.

What is the pathogenesis of pneumothorax?,Leak from pulmonary alveoli,Oesophageal rupture,Ruptured apical bullae on lung surface,Underlying asthma,Underlying emphysema,C,Spontaneous rupture of bullae or after minimal trauma causes primary pneumothorax in the young. Smoking cessation should be advised. oesophagel rupture would not happen in a pneumothorax nor would alveolar leak.  Underlying asthma would not cause bullae disease and empysema would be unlikley in a 19-year-old

However, the initial treatment is the same independent of the underlying cause. All of the above answers are reasonable, however resuscitation of the sick patient still follows the ABC algorithm:  Airway Breathing Circulation.  Airway control and oxygen to maintain normal saturations is the first part of that algorithm. Subsequent fluid resuscitation and treatment of the underlying cause can then be initiated. The need for invasive monitoring and intensive care is then assessed, depending on the response to initial treatment."

respiratory system,86,Which of the following is correct in a patient with left-sided tension pneumothorax?,An urgent chest x ray is mandatory,Neck veins are usually distended,Needle thoraco-centesis should not be performed if the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line cannot be accurately identified,The insertion of a chest drain is only indicated if there is an associated rib fracture,The trachea is pushed towards the left,B,"Tension pneumothorax is a clinical diagnosis and a life-threatening emergency. The chest is hyperexpanded, hyperresonant, neck veins are distended (due to obstruction of venous return to the superior vena cava), the trachea is pushed towards the opposite side, and breath sounds are reduced. Though the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line is the preferred site, a needle (cannula) could be inserted through any intercostal space on the affected side, since it is essential to relieve the pressure as soon as possible. This should be followed by formal chest drain insertion and connected to an underwater seal (in all patients) and forms an integral part of the resuscitation."

Duration of disease is 18 months, so it is not acute bronchitis. Again only one tablespoonful sputum does not justify the term copious sputum of bronhiectasis in which sputum will be much more like cup-full in amount. So it is chronic bronchitis"
respiratory system,91,"A 32 year old presents with a one week history of malaise, fever, headache, myalgia with a sore throat, dry cough and pleuritic chest pain. On examination there is bibasal crepitations. There is evidence of erythema nodosum and bloods reveal a haemolytic anaemia and cold agglutinins. What is the most likely causative agent?",H. Influenzae,Coxiella Burnetti,Streptococcus Pneumoniae,Influenza B,Mycoplasma Pneumoniae,E,The history of non specific flu like illness with dry cough should raise the suspicion of mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coxiella burnetti can present with a non specific illness however there is no history of exposure to farm yard animals. A clue also for the diagnosis is the evidence of haemolytic anaemia with cold agglutinins and erythema nodosum which can complicate mycoplasma pneumoniae. Extra pulmonary manifestations are common such as rashes. Neurological complications such as meningitis or cardiac such as myocarditis and pericarditis can also occur. Often the pneumonia is not the predominant feature. Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice.
respiratory system,92,A 54 year old male with a history of COPD presents with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. A CXR reveals an air rim of greater than 2cm and sats are 90%. How should this patient me managed initially?,Aspiration,Chest drain,High flow oxygen,Admit for observation,Discharge with outpatient follow up,B,This patient has COPD and this is thus likely to be a secondary pneumothorax. If the patient is greater than 50 with breathlessness and rim of air greater than 2cm then aspiration is unlikely to be successful and therefore a chest drain should be inserted.
respiratory system,93,"A 34-year-old woman with severe asthma comes to the clinic for review. She is currently taking 800 mcg per day of inhaled beclomethasone, yet still feels significantly short of breath and is coughing at night nearly every night. On examination her PEFR is 340, compared to 500 predicted. She has extensive wheeze on auscultation of both lung fields. Which of the following is the most appropriate next intervention?",Add salmeterol 50 mcg/day,Change to fluticasone 400 mcg/day,Increase beclomethasone to 1600 mcg/day,Start montelukast 10 mg/day,Start prednisolone 5 mg/day,D,"NICE guidelines suggest that adding in a long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) should occur after a LTRA has been trialled.  A change to fluticasone 400 mcg/day is essentially maintaining the status quo, as fluticasone is roughly twice as potent as beclomethasone. If control was not reached after addition of LTRA then a LABA would be the next option.   "
respiratory system,94,"A 72-year-old man is referred to the chest clinic with a progressive history of dyspnoea, and a dry cough over the last eight months. He currently smokes 20/day and has done for 53 years. He has had several episodes of acute shortness of breath for which he has received antibiotics from his GP. On examination he is clubbed, and basal inspiratory crepitations are heard on auscultation. His oxygen saturations are 87% on air. He undergoes a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) which demonstrates bilateral basal and subpleural reticular changes with honeycombing evident. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cryptogenic organising pneumonia (COP),Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP),Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP),Respiratory bronchiolitis - interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD,Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP),E,"This patient most likely has idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis (IIP). IIP is further subdivided into  Usual interstitial pneumonia (previously known as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis) and Non-usual interstitial pneumonitis.  UIP causes 70% of IIP. It is typically found in an older population and is characterised by a gradual onset with acute exacerbations. It is worse in smokers. Reticular abnormalities, honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis are typical HRCT findings. Unfortunately patients with UIP have a poor response to steroids and immunosuppressants and the median survival is two to three years post-diagnosis. The remaining answers are members of the non-usual interstitial pneumonitis (non-UIP). Of this group non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) is the most common. On CT there is typically ground glass appearance and there is better steroid responsiveness when compared to UIP, with an improved survival. COP is subacute and tends to cause patchy consolidation and/or nodules on CT scan. RB-ILD usually occurs in heavy smokers. CT findings include bronchial wall thickening and patchy ground glass appearance. DIP is a form of severe RB-ILD."
respiratory system,95,A 35-year-old man has been diagnosed as allergic rhinitis and asthma. Examination: peripheral neuropathy with tingling and numbness in a ‘glove and stocking’ distribution. Skin lesions are present in the form of tender subcutaneous nodules. The patient is responding well to corticosteroids. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?,AS,Churg-strauss syndrome,Cryptogenic organizing,Extrinsic allergic alveolitis,Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia,B,"The American College of Rheumatology has identified six criteria for the diagnosis of CSS: Asthma (wheezing, expiratory rhonchi). Eosinophilia of more than 10% in peripheral blood. Paranasal sinusitis. Pulmonary infiltrates (may be transient). Histological confirmation of vasculitis with extravascular eosinophils. Mononeuritis multiplex or polyneuropathy. The presence of four out of six of these features has a high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of CSS"
respiratory system,96,"A 52 year old male who keeps pigeons presents to his GP.  He states for some months he has had a productive cough, shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue, anorexia and has lost 2 stones in weight.    On examination there is bibasal inspiratory crackles.  A CXR reveals reticulonodular shadowing.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Sarcoidosis,Cryptogenic Allergic Alveolitis,Extrinsic Allergic Alveolitis,Mesothelioma,Congestive Cardiac Failure,C,"The most likely diagnosis is extrinsic allergic alveolitis.  This is a diffuse granulomatous inflammation in lung parenchyma and airways following repeated exposure to organic antigens.  This patient presents in the sub acute form although there is an acute and chronic form.  In the acute form there is a flu like illness with fever, chest tightness, cough and dyspnoea 4 to 6 hours after exposure.  In the chronic form there is typically fatigue, upper lobe fibrosis and dyspnoea on exertion.  Causes include farmers lung due to mouldy hay exposure, bird fanciers lung and numerous others.  A CXR may reveal reticulonodular shadowing in sub acute form and upper lobe fibrosis is typical of the chronic form.  Hugh resolution CT and antigen specific IgG antibodies are useful for the diagnosis.  The key to management is avoidance of the allergen and corticosteroids."
respiratory system,97,"A 62-year-old man comes to the respiratory clinic. He was diagnosed with COPD several years ago. He is on regular steroid inhalers, long acting B2 agonist and ipratropium. He has been discharged from hospital following an infective exacerbation four weeks ago. On examination he is apyrexial and his chest is clear. His FEV1 is 1.2 L. His blood gases on air show the following:    pH 7.4 (7.35-7.45)   PCO2 5.5 kPa (4.7-6.0)   PaO2 7.3 kPa (11.3-12.6)    He stopped smoking six months ago. Which of the following will you consider?",Discharge from clinic,Give a course of oral steroids,Prescribe oral antibiotics,Repeat blood gases on air in three months,Start LTOT (long term oxygen therapy),D,"Indications of LTOT in the United Kingdom:  PO2 less than7.3 kPA on air (O2 saturation less than88%) in a stable clinical state. Borderline results should be repeated in three months. You should demonstrate that the patient does not become hypercapnic on oxygen therapy. PO2 7.3-8 kPa if there is pulmonary hypertension, polycythaemia, or additional nocturnal hypoxaemia.  Blood gases should be performed in a stable state, which should be at least four weeks after an exacerbation of the disease. There is no indication in this scenario for steroids or antibiotics."
respiratory system,98,An 18-year-old boy is suspected of having cystic fibrosis. Which of the following results would be most suggestive of this condition?,Abnormal pancreatic function tests,Abnormalities in lung function tests,Bronchiectasis on a chest x ray,Elevated sweat chloride concentration,Low immunoreactive plasma trypsinogen,D,"The sweat test is the most important test for cystic fibrosis (CF). Up to 99% of children with CF have sweat chloride and sodium levels above 60 and 70 mM respectively. In normal children, sweat sodium is higher than chloride. The reversed ratio is another pointer to CF. Two sweat tests should be performed spontaneously on both arms with pilocarpine iontophoresis. Older children with CF and pancreatic insufficiency have low immunoreactive trypsin. This and the other tests mentioned may be suggestive of CF but are not diagnostic."
respiratory system,99,Listed below are the five causes of hypoxia. Which one of the five inevitably causes an increased PaCO2?,Diffusion impairment,Hypoventilation,Low inspired PO2,Right-to-left shunt,Ventilation-perfusion mismatch,B,"Hypoventilation, where inadequate alveolar ventilation results in low alveolar PO2, is the only cause of hypoxia that inevitably causes raised PaCO2. If the hypoxia is out of proportion to the hypercapnia and the Alveolar-arterial (A-a) PO2 gradient increased then another mechanism (diffusion impairment, right-to-left shunt or ventilation-perfusion mismatch) must also be present. The primary effects of right-to-left shunts and ventilation-perfusion mismatching are to raise arterial CO2 content, however this is usually corrected (and sometimes over-corrected) by a reflex increase in ventilation."
respiratory system,100,A 29-year-old professional singer presents with a prolonged history of epistaxis and rapidly progressive shortness of breath. The KCO and eosinophil count are raised. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Alveolar proteinosis,Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA),Goodpasture's syndrome,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Microscopic polyangiitis,D,"This patient has shortness of breath and a raised KCO, which leads to you to a diagnosis of alveolar haemorrhage. The condition which links epistaxis and alveolar haemorrhage in the list above is Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. KCO measures the uptake of carbon monoxide by the lungs, and is equivalent to the transfer factor. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and a small-vessel vasculitis.A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia. The detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies directed against proteinase-3 is highly specific, but is found in only 50% of patients with disease localised to the respiratory tract and 95% with generalised Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Standard therapy is with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. TNF-alpha blocking agents, anti-thymocyte globulin and monoclonal anti T-cell antibodies can be used in disease refractory to these agents. Systemic inflammation and vasculitis contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and there is therefore a significantly increased incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction and occlusive artery disease. Alveolar proteinosis is a rare diffuse lung condition, characterised by alveolar and interstitial accumulation of phospholipid protein derived from surfactant. It can be congenital, secondary or acquired, and patients often present with recurrent respiratory infections. Transfer factor (KCO) is typically reduced. Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare systemic vasculitis which affects small and medium sized vessels, in association with asthma. Patients initially present with allergic rhinitis and asthma, followed by eosinophilia and associated infiltrative disease (e.g. gastroenteritis) and then granulomatous inflammation classically within 3 years. Goodpasture's syndrome is an important, and potentially rapidly fatal, cause of alveolar haemorrhage. It is caused by circulating antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies, and typically causes an acute glomerulonephritis. Epistaxis is not as common an association. Microscopic polyangiitis is a small vessel vasculitis which classically spares the upper respiratory tract. "
respiratory system,101,"According to the latest NICE guidance, which of the below combinations of post-bronchodilator results is now classed as severe airflow obstruction in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)?",FEV1/FVC less than0.7 andamp; FEV1predicted less than30%,FEV1/FVC less than0.7 andamp; FEV1 predicted 30-49%,FEV1/FVC less than0.7 andamp; FEV1 predicted 50-79%,FEV1/FVC less than0.75 andamp; FEV1 predicted less than30%,FEV1/FVC less than0.75 andamp; FEV1 predicted 30-49%,B,"NICE have published clinical guidance on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (NG115) to help with the assessment of airflow obstruction.

Below are the classifications:    Mild FEV1 predicted more than 80%   Moderate FEV1 predicted 50-79%   Severe FEV1 predicted 30-49%   Very severe FEV1 predicted less than 30%    FEV1/FVC ratio is less than 0.7 in COPD."
respiratory system,102,A 21-year-old gentleman with cystic fibrosis presents with infertility. What is the most likely cause for this?,Chronic prostatic insufficiency,Failure of development of the vas deferens,Increasing alkalinisation of semen,Primary failure of testosterone production,Production of anti-sperm antibodies,B,"Infertility occurs in 98% of adult men secondary to maldevelopment of the vas deferens or to other forms of obstructive azoospermia. In women, fertility is decreased secondary to viscid cervical secretions. Chronic prostatic insufficiency more commonly ocurs in older men. The other causes are much rarer in a young man."
respiratory system,103,"A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic for review. Over the past few months he has suffered increasing night sweats, fatigue, weight loss and a chronic cough. In addition he has presented to his GP with bilateral parotid swelling and red, painful eyes on three occasions in the past year. Most recently he has suffered a weakness of the left side of his face. On examination his BP is 135/75 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular, there are bilateral scattered crackles on auscultation of the chest and bilateral parotid swellings. He has a left lower motor neurone seventh nerve palsy. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 141 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 6.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 312 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Felty's syndrome,Heerfordt's syndrome,Lofgren's syndrome,Meig's syndrome,Turner's syndrome,B,"Heerfordt's syndrome is an acute presentation of sarcoidosis, which presents with fever, uveitis, swelling of the parotid and other salivary and lacrimal glands. Facial nerve palsy may be a feature, and other features of sarcoidosis may co-exist (e.g. skin lesions, pulmonary involvement). As it represents a form of neurosarcoidosis, other neurological features may be present (e.g. meningism, ophthalmoplegia and pupillary reflex dysfunction). Felty's syndrome is the association triad of rheumatoid arthritis, neutropenia and splenomegaly. It is rare, and getting rarer with the better treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Its cause is unknown, but it is associated with the HLA-DR4 genotype which is associated with a more aggressive form of the disease. Lofgren's syndrome is a subtype of sarcoidosis which presents with hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum, arthralgia and fever. Prognosis is good, and the development of chronic disease is rare. Meig's syndrome is the association of a benign ovarian tumour, ascites and pleural effusion. Classically, the fluid resolves if the tumour is removed. In its original description the tumour is a fibroma, but can be a thecoma, cystadenoma or granulosa cell tumour (when it is referred to as pseudo-Meigs' syndrome). Turner's is the syndrome associated with the XO sex chromosome type. Affected girls have a classical appearance, including neck webbing, short stature and ovarian failure. There is also an increased risk of congenital heart defects, lymphoedema, renal malformations, deafness and osteoporosis."
respiratory system,104,A 25 year old female has an acute asthma attack. She is tachycardic and is tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 35. On auscultation she is very wheezy but is beginning to tire. Her peak flow is bout one third of her normal. She is commenced on both salbutamol and ipratropium nebulisers and IV hydrocortisone however has not greatly improved. Her gases reveal a high normal CO2 level and low normal O2 level on a trauma mask. Which other treatment option is the most appropriate to be be tried whilst waiting for ITU to assess the patient?,CPAP,IV magnesium sulphate,BiPAP,IV aminophylline,IV salbutamol,B,"IV magnesium sulphate can be useful in the management of a life threatening acute asthma attack. Any patient attending with features of a life threatening attack such as PEF less than 33%, exhaustion or silent chest then ITU should be informed. HE CO2 being high normal is very worrying. IV salbutamol and IV aminophylline are not routinely recommended and should be commenced by seniors. This patient requires ventilation and CPAP and BiPAP are not appropriate."
respiratory system,105,A 78-year-old woman is brought by her family to the A & E department with shortness of breath and occasional cough over the previous 72 hours. There is a coarse crepitation present at the right lung base. What is the single most appropriate investigation?,Arterial blood gases,Chest X-ray,Electrocardiogram (ECG),Haemoglobin,Magnetic resonance imaging scan (MRI) of the chest.,B,Probable pneumonia. Chest X-ray should be done
respiratory system,106,In which of the following have randomised controlled trials shown that long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) reduces mortality?,Asthma,Cor pulmonale due to chronic airflow obstruction,Cystic fibrosis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Pulmonary sarcoidosis,B,Adequate data for LTOT prolonging survival exist only for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) although in practice it is assumed to apply in other chronic hypoxaemic lung conditions. 
respiratory system,107,"A 48-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with a one week history of a non-productive cough and increasing breathlessness. She reports her breathing is much worse on exertion. Her past medical history includes hypertension, migraines and a renal transplant for end stage hypertensive nephropathy. Examination reveals mild pyrexia of 37.8°C and most notably she was profoundly hypoxic with oxygen saturations of 80% on air. An arterial blood gas confirmed her hypoxia. A CXR showed some patchy bilateral infiltrates, more pronounced on the left. She is diagnosed with community-acquired pneumonia and treated empirically with recommended antibiotics. The next day she deteriorates and requires intubation and ventilation. What is the most likely causative organism?",Chlamydia pneumoniae,Legionella pneumophila,Pneumocystis carinii,Pneumocystis jiroveci,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,D,"Pneumocystis jiroveci is a eukaryotic microorganism. In immunosuppressed patients (such as those post-transplant) it can cause a pneumonia, which is most recognised in patients with AIDS but can also be seen in those with organ transplants or when undergoing chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 is associated with significant risk. In Europe, the USA and Australia P. jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients is seen largely in those unaware of their HIV status. Unfortunately it is a major cause of death in Africa, especially in children. Previously it was thought that disease was caused by reactivation of latent infection acquired in childhood, but de novo infection is increasingly recognised. The organism was initially described as Pneumocystis carinii, but this is the variant that causes infection in animals and not humans. The human variant of the organism is Pneumocystis jiroveci. The pneumonia caused by P. jiroveci is potentially severe and fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Clinically it presents with several weeks' history of dry cough, fever and dyspnoea. Examination findings are often subtle, but include tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and fine respiratory crackles. Typically, patients desaturate markedly on exertion. There may be reduced transfer factor, vital capacity and total lung capacity on spirometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum can be used to demonstrate the organism (open lung biopsy is gold standard, but rarely performed in clinical practice). Giemsa, Papanicolaou and Grocott's stains are used. There are a variety of different chest radiograph findings. Typically it causes bilateral symmetrical perihilar reticular or granular interstitial shadowing. Less often there can be asymmetric shadowing, or progression to a reticular-alveolar pattern. Occasionally lobar consolidation, nodular lesions, prominent pulmonary arteries, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, cysts or pneumatoceles can be seen. In patients who have been on prophylactic inhaled pentamidine the infiltrates may predominantly affect the upper lobes. A normal chest x ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not typical, but be aware of the possibility of multiple disease processes in an immunosuppressed patient. If allowed to progress, P. jiroveci can disseminate via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes to affect the thyroid, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. If PCP is suspected, treatment with full dose co-trimoxazole should be started as soon as possible. It should be given for 21 days in HIV-positive cases, but shorter doses can be used in other causes of immunosuppression. In patients who are intolerant or co-trimoxazole, intravenous pentamidine can be used. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids can reduce the risk of respiratory failure, and they are therefore used in some cases. Prophylaxis should be used in immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of developing PCP: all those with a CD4 count of less than200, patients started on high dose steroids, and those on chemotherapeutic regimens associated with significant immunosuppression. Co-trimoxazole is also the first-line prophylactic agent. Pseudomonas is common in hospital-acquired pneumonia, and in patients with cystic fibrosis. The other two are atypical pathogens. However given the history and findings, PCP should be excluded first. "
respiratory system,108,Which of the following statements concerning industrial lung disorders is correct?,Occupational asthma occurs more frequently in atopic persons,Pneumoconiosis can be diagnosed in the absence of chest x ray abnormalities,Silo filler's disease is caused by allergy to grain,Widespread crepitations are typically heard in hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Symptoms occur within minutes of exposure to mouldy hay in farmer's lung,A,"Occupational asthma also occurs more frequently in smokers. Pneumoconiosis is an x ray diagnosis. It is due to deposition of coal dust in parenchyma and reaction to its presence. The types - simple/complicated - are diagnosed on x ray appearance. Silo filler's disease is pulmonary oedema caused by inhalation of oxides of nitrogen generated by fresh silage. Symptoms of farmer's lung usually occur within hours. Examination in hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually reveals inspiratory crepitations which tend to be basal rather than widespread, sometimes squeaks, but wheeze is not typical."
respiratory system,109,A 62-year-old previous shipyard worker complains of breathlessness and chest pain for 6 nomths. He has now developed a large pleural effusion. Which is the single best diagnostic investigation?,ABG,Bronchoscopy,CXR,Pleural biopsy,Transfer factor,D,Shipyard worker is exposed to asbestos and the likely diagnosis here is mesothelioma for which single best investigation is pleural biopsy
respiratory system,110,A 44 year old smoker presents with increasing shortness of breath. She states she  has fainted a couple of times on exertion. On examination there is a right ventricular heave and loud pulmonary second heart sound and an ECG shows right ventricular hypertrophy. Her chest is clear. A CXR is performed and is normal. What investigation should be performed for the definitive diagnosis?,Pulmonary function tests,CTPA,Coagulation screen,D dimers,Exercise tolerance test,B,This patient is shows signs of right ventricular strain secondary to pulmonary hypertension. Her chest is clear and CXR is normal making COPD unlikely. The only plausible diagnosis which could lead to the pulmonary hypertension is multiple recurrent emboli. Smoking is a risk factor for pulmonary emboli. CT pulmonary angiography or ventilation perfusion scan can be utilised for the diagnosis. An echo may be useful to assess the right ventricular strain. D dimers are non specific and do not provide a definitive diagnosis.
respiratory system,111,How are the majority of cases of familial primary pulmonary hypertension inherited?,Autosomal recessive,X linked recessive,X linked dominant,Autosomal dominant,Mitochondrial,D,Primary pulmonary hypertension is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and in some a mutation of the bone morphogenic protein receptor is found.
respiratory system,112,A 68-year-old man has had malaise for 5 days and fever for 2 days. He has cough and there is dullness to percussion at the left lung base. What is the single most appropriate investigation?,Bronchoscopy,CXR,CT,MRI,V/Q scan,B,Given presentation is suggestive of pneumonia for which investigation of choice is CXR
respiratory system,113,"A patient presents with progressive dyspnea. He complains of cough, wheeze and a table spoonful of mucopurulent sputum for the last 18m. Spirometry has been done. FEV1/FVC 2.3/3.6. After taking salbutamol, the ratio is 2.4/3.7. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Chronic bronchitis,Asthma,Bronchiectasis,Lung fibrosis,Sarcoidosis,A,"Progressive dyspnoea, wheeze productive cough and the result of spirometry (prebronchodilator FEV1/FVC ratio of 64% and postbronchodilator. FEV1/FVC ratio of 65%) points towards the diagnosis of chronic bronchitis. Some may think of bronchiectasis! But in bronchiectasis there is copious purulent sputums (as cup full of sputum not table spoon full!)"
respiratory system,114,A 52-year-old man enquired about the advisability of vaccination prior to a holiday abroad. He had been treated for asthma with long term steroids and regularly required doses of prednisolone in excess of 30 mg daily to control acute exacerbations. Which one of the following vaccinations would be contraindicated in this man?,Bacillus Calmette-Guérin - BCG,Diphtheria toxoid,H. influenzae B,Meningococcus ,Tetanus toxoid,A,"Some individuals, particularly those that are immunosuppressed, are at risk if they are given live vaccines. Inactivated vaccines are generally not dangerous but may be ineffective. They are also at risk of severe manifestations to vaccines such as disseminated infection with bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG). Those patients who receive prednisolone 40 mg/day for more than a week or who are on lower doses for more prolonged periods should be considered to be immunosuppressed. Asthma alone is not a contraindication to vaccination even if patients are taking inhaled corticosteroids."
respiratory system,115,A lifelong non-smoker is diagnosed with emphysema. Which of the following would be the most likely aetiological agent?,Asbestos ,Cadmium exposure,Isocyanates ,Steel ,Zinc ,B,It should be noted that this question asks about 'emphysema' specifically and not chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Cadmium inhalation is a recognised cause of emphysema. The relationship between asbestos exposure and emphysema is not so clear. Asbestos exposure typically causes lung fibrosis. Other industrial associations with COPD include:  Coal Cotton Grain Cement.  There are many others. 
respiratory system,116,"A 65-year-old woman has smoked 50 cigarettes a day for 40 years. She has had increasing dyspnoea for the several years, but no cough. A chest x ray shows increased lung size along with flattening of the diaphragms, consistent with emphysema. Over the next several years she develops worsening peripheral oedema. Her vital signs show temperature 36.7°C, pulse 80 bpm, respiratory rate 15, and BP 120/80 mmHg. Which of the following cardiac findings is most likely to be present?",Constrictive pericarditis,Left ventricular (LV) aneurysm,Mitral valve stenosis,Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis,Right ventricular hypertrophy,E,"The most likely finding in this woman is pulmonary hypertension as a result of emphysema secondary to long term cigarette smoking. Peripheral oedema is due to right heart dilatation and failure. Mitral stenosis is not supported by the history. Constrictive pericarditis could be caused by a lung malignancy in this patient, but again, there is no suggestion of this in the history. Constrictive pericarditis would be characterised by soft heart sounds, a diastolic andquot;pericardial knockandquot;, and gross signs of right heart failure. LV aneurysm would lead to symptoms and signs of left heart failure and again is not the most likely finding suggested by the history."
respiratory system,117,"A 40-year-old gentleman is referred to the chest clinic with worsening asthma symptoms. He had been diagnosed with late onset asthma aged 35 years. On questioning the patient reports a short history of malaise, fever and tender subcutaneous nodules on his legs. He has had no haemoptysis. A full blood count is performed and the results are as follows:    Haemoglobin 145 g/L (130-180)   Platelet count 240 ×10^9/L (150-400)   White cell count 12.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 7.8 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Lymphocytes 2.5 ×10^9/L (1.5-4)   Monocytes 0.1 ×10^9/L (0-0.8)   Eosinophils 2.0 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   Basophils 0.09 ×10^9/L (0-0.1)    A full blood count from three years earlier was reviewed and its results were as follows:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (130-180)   Platelet count 162 ×10^9/L (150-400)   White cell count 9.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 5.5 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)   Lymphocytes 3.5 ×10^9/L (1.5-4)   Monocytes 0.5 ×10^9/L (0-0.8)   Eosinophils 0.9 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   Basophils 0.1 ×10^9/L (0-0.1)    A chest x ray is performed which shows patchy pulmonary infiltrates. Given the patient's history and the results of initial investigations, which is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute respiratory distress syndrome,Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA),Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Instrinsic asthma,Microscopic polyangiitis,B,"Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of small-vessel vasculitis, characterised by asthma, allergic rhinitis and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia. Two of these are present in the history and should lead you to the diagnosis of EGPA. The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. EGPA, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The unifying feature of patients presenting with EGPA is asthma. Vasculitis involving the peripheral nervous system is also a characteristic feature, and mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 75% of patients. Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with EGPA. 40-60% are associated with positive ANCA, usually pANCA/MPO. ANCA are antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Several different staining patterns and antigen specificities are recognised. The cytoplasmic staining pattern, cANCA, and specificity for the PR3 antigen is most specific for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Perinuclear staining, pANCA, and/or antibody to MPO are far less specific than cANCA and can be present in a range of inflammatory conditions such as microscopic polyangitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and Goodpasture's syndrome. MPO and pANCA may also be present in SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and occasionally in chronic infections. Intravenous glucocorticoid is used for initial therapy of acute multi-organ involvement in EGPA, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy, often with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and a small-vessel vasculitis. A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia. Microscopic polyangiitis is microscopically similar to WG, but does not tend to involve the nasopharynx. It has an association with hepatitis B and C. Acute respiratory distress syndrome describes an acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury, often in previously healthy lungs. It has an acute onset, and patients often require respiratory support. It can be precipitated by a number of insults, including drugs and pancreatitis. The presence of systemic symptoms makes a diagnosis of asthma alone unlikely."
respiratory system,118,"A 71-year-old man presents to the Emergency department with an influenza-like illness. He says this has been accompanied by a dry cough and diarrhoea over the past few days, and his wife tells you that he is becoming increasingly drowsy and forgetful. They have returned from a hotel in Spain some two days earlier, where they were staying for the winter. On examination he is pyrexial 38.2°C, pulse is 92 and BP is 100/60 mmHg. There is bilateral wheeze on auscultation of the chest.

The source of infection may have been the air conditioning system at his Spanish hotel. Macrolides are the drug of choice in managing the condition. Klebsiella and Staphylococcus tend to be cavitating pneumonias, with Klebsiella being associated with chronic alcoholism, and Staphylococcus with post-influenza pneumonia. Mycoplasma tends to affect a single lobe, and is associated with haemolytic anaemia."
respiratory system,119,"A 22-year-old man presents with increased shortness of breath, a dry cough, right sided pleuritic chest pain and extreme lethargy over two weeks. He has no significant medical history of note but says a few other people have been ill in his class at university over the past few weeks. On examination he is pyrexial 38.2°C, BP is 110/72 mmHg, pulse is 85 and regular. There is scattered wheeze, more marked on the right than the left.

Blood film - schistocytes. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",Legionella pneumophila,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,B,"Epidemic pneumonia due to Mycoplasma infection is seen occasionally, and the fact that a number of his class mates have recently been ill points to this as a possible cause. Classically, mycoplasma presents with a slow-onset of symptoms (sometimes over weeks) with prominent constitutional upset, including headache, chest pain, myalgia and malaise. There is classically a persistent dry cough. Extra-respiratory features include:  erythema multiforme erythema nodosum urticaria Guillain-Barré syndrome transverse myelitis aseptic meningitis cold agglutinins haemolytic anaemia (as seen here) arthritis pericarditis myocarditis, and pancreatitis (rarely).  It is spread by direct contact, and most cases resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. Often signs on examination are less severe than would be expected once the x ray findings are reviewed, as is the case here. Macrolides such as clarithromycin are first choice antibiotics if required."

respiratory system,121,Which of the following is a recognised treatment for complications of cystic fibrosis?,DNase to assist in reinflating collapsed lung segments,Hypotonic saline drinks for hypernatraemic dehydration,Nebulised tobramycin for Pseudomonas colonisation of the lower respiratory tract,Pancreatic transplant for diabetes mellitus,Rectal pull-through and anastamosis for rectal prolapse,C,"Human recombinant DNase given as a single daily aerosol seems to improve pulmonary function, decrease the frequency of chest exacerbations, and promotes a sense of well-being in patients with mild to moderate disease with purulent secretions. This may be because, in the inflamed airway, the nuclei from dead cells account for much of the viscidity of secretions. Rectal prolapse is usually idiopathic, occurring between one and five years.  Intestinal parasites Malnutrition Acute diarrhoea Ulcerative colitis Pertussis Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Meningocoele Cystic fibrosis Chronic constipation  can also predispose to it. Following defecation the prolapse usually resolves spontaneously, or through manual reinsertion by the patient or parent. Nebulised tobramycin or gentamicin may be given when airway pathogens are resistant to oral antibiotics, or where infection is difficult to control at home. Hypernatraemic dehydration should be treated in the usual way. Copyright "
respiratory system,122,A patient presents with a life threatening asthma attack. Which of the following is the most worrying feature?,PO2 of 9.8,Previously required oral steroids,Previous ITU admission,Consolidation on CXR,PCO2 of 5.6 kPa,E,If a patient with asthma has a normal CO2 this suggests they are tiring. Normally due to increased respiratory effort the CO2 would be low.
respiratory system,123,"A 32-year-old man presents with fever, shortness of breath and productive cough for five weeks. Prior to that he was fit and well with no respiratory complaints. His only medical history is that he frequently visits his dentist for teeth problems and has been a heavy drinker for a long time. Three weeks ago he was given antibiotics by his GP with slight improvement but then got worse. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma precipitated by pneumonia,Bronchiectasis,Empyema,Lung abscess,Pulmonary embolism (PE),D,"Predisposing factors for lung abscess include dental disease, impaired consciousness, for example, alcohol, post-anaesthesia, bronchial carcinoma and immunosuppression. Empyema may cause a productive cough but usually is associated with shortness of breath and fever. PE is unlikely in this scenario as well as asthma. Bronchiectasis is a chronic condition and usually there is underlying cause."
respiratory system,124,"A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with a one hour history of shortness of breath, and chest tightness. The symptoms occurred acutely, and she has suffered identical attacks previously which are increasing in frequency. Her GP has treated her with a salbutamol inhaler, although she has not had any formal pulmonary function testing. Usage of her salbutamol inhaler has not helped her shortness of breath. On examination she is distressed and chest examination shows vesicular breath sounds with an elevated respiratory rate. Oxygen saturation is 98% on air which is sustained on exertion. Chest x ray is normal and arterial blood gas analysis shows:    pH 7.52 (7.35-7.45)   pCO2 2.2kPa (4.7-7.45)   pO2 18 kPa (increased from 15) (10.0-13.0)   HCO3 25 (22.0 - 30.0)     Which of the following would be your diagnosis?",Acute asthma attack (mild),Hyperventilation (psychogenic),Pulmonary embolism,Respiratory muscle disease,Volume depletion,B,"This patient's blood gas sample shows a respiratory alkalosis, as demonstrated by the raised pH, low pCO2 and normal bicarbonate. The most likely cause therefore is hyperventilation, possibly due to high levels of anxiety. Other causes include pain, altitude and excessive mechanical ventilation. In acute asthma, the pCO2 may be low, as the patient has an elevated respiratory rate, however in this instance there should be a history of the condition, clinical signs or a reduced pO2. Pulmonary embolism can also present similarly, but in the absence of any disclosed risk factors, a normal pO2 and oxygen saturations maintained on exertion, this becomes less likely. Respiratory muscle disease typically results in a respiratory acidosis. Volume depletion (from a number of causes) would typically cause a metabolic alkalosis."
respiratory system,125,A 64-year-old man who was exposed to asbestos for 40 years presents with weight loss and chest pain. The diagnosis of mesothelioma has been made. He develops SOB (shortness of breath) and X-ray shows pleural effusion.

For this dyspnoeic patient chest drain is most appropriate now
respiratory system,126,A 19-year-old male attends the Emergency department complaining of a sudden left-sided chest pain followed by dyspnoea. These symptoms developed whilst playing football. Which of the following investigations is most likely to provide a definitive diagnosis?,Blood gases,Chest x ray,Echocardiogram,Electrocardiogram (ECG),Pulmonary function tests,B,"The history is suggestive of a pneumothorax, and of the available investigations a chest x ray is the only test which will provide a definitive diagnosis. ECG would be unlikely to reveal any abnormality and blood gases would be most likely to reveal a highish O2 with lowish CO2 in the absence of any appreciable respiratory compromise."
respiratory system,127,"An otherwise healthy 32-year-old man was the driver of a car involved in a high speed RTA three days ago. He has sustained a closed fracture of his femur which has been treated surgically with an intramedullary nail, as well as fractures of his right clavicle and left radius. He was managed according to ATLS protocol when he attended the emergency department. On examination he is acutely short of breath and has a temperature of 37.5°C. The patient seems confused when you speak to him, and as you examine him, you note petechial haemorrhages. What do you think is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma attack,Chest infection,Fat embolism,Pulmonary embolism,Tension pneumothorax,C,"The two diagnoses which should be considered first in this scenario are pulmonary embolism and fat embolism. Although the patient is at high risk of pulmonary embolism, and appropriate measures should be undertaken to reduce this, the clinical scenario is more suggestive of fat embolism. Fat embolism is thought to occur as a result of release of lipid globules from damaged bone marrow fat cells. Another mechanism that has been suggested is the increased mobilisation of fatty acids peripherally. The effects that are seen clinically depend on what part of the microvasculature is affected by the lipid globules. Pulmonary symptoms are caused by ventilation perfusion mismatch. Confusion (cerebral effects) may be seen, as well as a petechial rash caused by capillary damage in the skin."
respiratory system,128,A 70-year-old man presents with weight loss and dyspnoea and is diagnosed with small cell lung cancer. Which one of the following is an adverse prognostic feature?,Cavitation on x ray,Finger clubbing,Hypernatraemia,Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy,Increased alkaline phosphatase,E,The following are adverse prognostic factors in small cell lung cancer:  Serum sodium less than 132 mmol/l Weight loss greater than 10% WHO performance status greater than 2 Alkaline phosphatase greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) greater than 1.5 times upper limit of normal Extensive disease (disease occuring outside one hemithorax and ipsilateral supraclavicular fossa nodes).
respiratory system,129,"A 23-year-old woman attends the clinic for asthma review. She remains significantly short of breath and has wheeze and coughing in the early hours of the morning. At her last appointment you instigated treatment with salmeterol as she was already on a stable dose of 400 mcg per day inhaled beclomethasone. On examination in the clinic her BP is 100/70 mmHg, her pulse is 70 and regular. She has scattered wheeze on auscultation of the chest and her PEFR is 380 (predicted 550). This is similar to prior to starting the salmeterol from which she perceives she has gained no benefit. According to asthma guidelines which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Add low dose oral steroids,Add montelukast,Add theophylline,Stop salmeterol and increase inhaled corticosteroid to 800 mcg/day,Switch to Maintenance and reliever therapy(MART) regime with low dose ICS,E,2011 guidelines have since been updated in 2017 which state that patients should switch to a MART regime if not deriving benefit from a LABA and ICS rather than stopping the LABA and increasing the ICS as previously stated in 2011.  New guidelines can be found here as well as more information on MART regimes. Given asthma is a chronic condition low dose oral steroids are considered a treatment of last resort at step five. Guideance has recently been updated in 2020 on the managment of asthma in children and young people though this does not apply here. 
respiratory system,130,A 45 year old patient with rheumatoid arthritis has relapsing pneumonia which does not respond to antibiotics. A CXR reveals bilateral parenchymal opacities. A lung biopsy is performed and reveals buds of connective tissue within terminal bronchioles and alevolar ducts. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Interstitial lung disease,Malignancy,COPD,Caplans syndrome,Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia,E,The symptoms and lung biopsy are characteristic of BOOP. BOOP is an organising pneumonia which is non infectious. It fails to respond to antibiotics. Steroids are very useful in the management.

His libido is low, he is suffering from headaches and he has been falling asleep during the day as he feels very unrefreshed after his sleep.  His BMI is 35. Polysomnography reveals a apnoea/hyponoea index of 10. His ABGs do not reveal significant hypoxia. Which of the following is useful initially in the management?",ABGs,BiPAP,LTOT,Weight loss and lifestyle advice,CPAP,D,"The diagnosis is obstructive sleep apneoa and these symptoms are classically of this. It is diagnosed via polysomnography whereby physiological recordnings are made during sleep and the number of apnoea/hypopnoea episodes are measured.  ABGs can be utilised to assess degree of hypoxia overnight and to therefore if CPAP is required however do not give the definitive diagnosis. OSA lead to RTAs sue to daytime sleepiness and it can lead to pulmonary hypertension and corpulmonale.  Lifestyle advice such as weight loss, smoking cessation and reduced alcohol advice should be given and is very useful initially. This man has a BMI of 35 and therefore weight loss is very important. His polysomnography reveals mild OSA and no significant hypoxia and thus CPAP is not indicated at this stage as it is most useful in moderate to severe and those with significant hypoxia.  Other management options include intra oral devisces to anterior displace the mandible and surgical techniques have been utilised."

respiratory system,136,"A 53-year-old dental secretary presents with a four month history of dry cough. She has never smoked. She denies haemoptysis, weight loss and dyspnoea. There is no post nasal drip. Her medical history consists only of hypertension for one year. She is on ramipril 2.5 mg, bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg and amlodipine 10 mg. On examination her JVP is not raised and her chest is clear. A CXR was requested. What would be the most likely cause of her cough?",Allergic rhinitis,Bronchiectasis,Drug induced,Interstitial lung disease,Lung cancer,C,ACE inhibitors can cause dry cough. They can then be replaced with an angiotensin receptor blocker. It is important to ask about the onset of cough and the start of a new drug. There no history to suggest allergic rhinitis. Bronchiectasis causes a productive cough. Interstitial lung disease and lung cancer may be causes but they are not the most likely and in this scenario there is nothing to suggest either.
respiratory system,137,"A 45-year-old man attends the Emergency department with symptoms suggestive of community acquired pneumonia.

The severity of each case of CAP should be assessed using the CURB-65 tool in conjunction with clinical judgement. Patients score 1 point for each of:  Confusion Urea greater than7 mmol/L Respiratory rate ≥30/min Blood pressure systolic less than90 or diastolic ≤60 mmHg Age ≥65 years.  A CURB-65 score of 0 or 1 are at low risk of death, and can be treated at home if the social circumstances are compatible. A score of 2 usually indicates inpatient treatment is required, but hospital-supervised outpatient treatment can be considered. Patients who have a CURB-65 score of 3 or more are at high risk of death. Those with scores of 4 and 5 should be considered for treatment in a critical care unit (HMU, ITU). In this question, option four has a CURB-65 score of 1 and outpatient treatment can therefore be considered. All the others are indications for inpatient treatment. Clinical judgement must still however be used particularly if only one feature is present or if there is co-morbidity such as age over 50 years or chronic cardiac, respiratory or renal disease. "
respiratory system,138,A 43-year-old patient with rheumatoid arthritis is sent to the clinic with increasing shortness of breath over a 6 week period. Lung function tests demonstrate a fall in the FEV1 which is markedly lower than tests last taken two months ago. The residual volume (RV) is increased by two litres but the measurements of diffusion are normal. The patient is a smoker. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute interstitial pneumonitis,Atypical pneumonia,Bronchiolitis obliterans,Caplan's syndrome,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,C,"All of the possible options can occur in rheumatoid arthritis but a progressive and relentless fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is the most characteristic of bronchiolitis obliterans. Bronchiolitis obliterans, with or without organising pneumonia, can be a fatal complication of rheumatoid arthritis (especially in women taking penicillamine). Histologically there is a mural concentric narrowing of the lumina of the bronchioles. It can present as severe respiratory insufficiency, and diagnosis is best made with lung biopsy.Inflammation in the small distal airways leads to obstructive spirometry and without treatment this is relentlessly progressive. Air trapping can occur, which leads to increased lung volumes. Corticosteroids can induce a quick response and improvement in symptoms. Rheumatoid serology often worsens with the onset of bronchiolitis obliterans. Other associations are with solid organ or bone marrow transplantation, and other connective tissue disorders. Caplan's syndrome is the combination of rheumatoid arthritis with pneumoconiosis related to coal dust. There is a rapid development of basal peripheral nodules, which can progress to severe pulmonary fibrosis. COPD is a possibility but it is rare for it to progress at the rate described here. The history is too long for an atypical pneumonia. Acute interstitial pneumonitis is associated with drug-treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, in particular methotrexate. "
respiratory system,139,"A 37-year-old male patient who recently returned back to UK from UAE attends the OPD with complaint of dry cough, breathlessness and anorexia.

He is now very unwell with a high grade fever, productive cough and type 1 respiratory failure. A chest Xray reveals multilobular patchy consolidation. There is also evidence of a pleural effusion. Given the most likely causative agent, which antibiotic is  a useful addition?",Doxycycline,Flucloxacillin,Erythromycin,Metronidazole,Ceftriaxone,B,The most likely causative agent is staphylococcus aureus. It most often follows a viral illness and patients can become very unwell very quickly as it can lead to a multilobular pneumonia with abscess formation. Flucloxacillin is a useful addition to antibiotic regimes if s. aureus is suspected.
respiratory system,141,A patient presents to chest clinic with an eight month history of cough and progressive breathlessness. Simple spirometry is performed and the results are below:    FEV1 1.7L (77% predicted)   FVC 2.3 L (61% predicted)   FEV1/FVC 0.73    Which of the below conditions are associated with this lung function picture?,Bronchiectasis,Emphysema,Obesity,Obliterative bronchiolitis,Simple coal worker's pneumoconiosis,C,This patient has a restrictive lung defect (FEV1/FVC greater than0.7). Obesity is a well recognised cause of restrictive lung defects. It is associated with hypoventilation and as a result can cause hypercapnia. Patients with simple coal worker's pneumoconiosis do not show significant abnormalities on pulmonary function tests.

It is therefore critical that you urgently obtain a sample of pleural fluid to confirm or exclude this, as an empyema requires a chest drain to be inserted. If pus is obtained, a chest drain should be inserted. Other fluid should be tested for pH, and if less than 7.2 this indicates an empyema and a drain should again be inserted. Fluid should also be sent for protein and LDH (to determine if it is a transudate or exudate), glucose, gram stain, microscopy, culture and sensitivity and cytology. Current UK best practice guidelines indicate ultrasound should be used to guide pleural aspiration, but ultrasound alone is unlikely to add further information. CT thorax may further delineate the consolidation, but is unlikely to influence management at this stage, and may cause contrast-induced nephropathy in this gentleman who has deranged renal function. It may be indicated at a later stage if the chest radiograph changes persist, to exclude an underlying pulmonary lesion. MRI thorax is also unlikely to add anything at this stage. Sputum cultures, whilst useful, will take at least 3-5 days to yield diagnostic information and pleural aspiration is therefore more critical at this stage. "

He is minimally breathless, with oxygen saturations of 96% on air (he usually has saturations of 95-97%). A chest x ray is performed and an observant CT1 recognises a 1.8 cm (18 mm) apical pneumothorax on a background of chronic changes consistent with emphysema/emphysematous changes. Accordingly to current guidelines, what intervention should be undertaken?",Admit and treat with high flow oxygen and repeat CXR in 24 hours,Aspirate and admit for 24 hours observation,Aspirate and discharge home after 12 hours if well,Discharge with advice to return if symptoms worsen,Intercostal chest drain insertion (Seldinger technique),B,"This patient has a small apical pneumothorax most likely as a result of his underlying lung disease and as such can be classed as a secondary pneumothorax. According to current BTS guidelines, if the patient is under 50, minimally breathless and the rim of air is less than 2 cm the initial intervention should be simple aspiration. Even if successful the patient should be admitted and observed for at least 24 hours. Unlike a primary pneumothorax, a secondary pneumothorax always requires intervention. Aspiration is less likely to be effective in a secondary pneumothorax and so if it fails or does not meet the above criteria, a chest drain needs to be inserted. The Seldinger technique using a 16G is the preferred method for this. Blunt dissection is usually reserved for trauma cases. "
respiratory system,148,Which one of the following cells in the lung parenchyma produces surfactant?,Alveolar macrophage,Endothelial cell,Goblet cell,Type I pneumocyte,Type II pneumocyte,E,Surfactant is produced by type 2 pneumocytes and is responsible for the ability of the air-filled alveoli to expand without collapse. Alveolar macrophages are repsonsible for pathogen recognition and destruction. Endothelial cells have many functions depending on their location.  Goblet cells are responsible for mucous production in the lungs Type 1 pneumoyctes are involved in gas exchaneg in the alveoli.
respiratory system,149,A patient is in a fire and is suspected to have respiratory tract burns as  she has burns to her face with singed eyebrows and nose hair and hoarseness.  What investigation should be organised to assess for inhalational damage?,CXR,Bronchoscopy,Laryngoscopy,CT Chest,ABGs,B,The standard for diagnosis of inhalation injury in most major centres is bronchoscopy.
respiratory system,150,"A 52-year-old woman has had a swelling in the neck, hoarseness and stridor-both inspiratory and expiratory for 2month. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Ca larynx,Ca thyroid,Vocal chord nodules,Ca bronchus,Thyrotoxicosis,B,There is no features of hyperthyroidism. So it is not thyrotoxicosis but Ca thyroid
respiratory system,151,Which of the following equations represents vital capacity?,Inspiratory reserve volume plus Expiratory reserve volume,Inspiratory reserve volume plus Tidal volume plus Expiratory reserve volume plus Residual volume,Inspiratory reserve volume plus Tidal volume plus Expiratory reserve volume,Inspiratory reserve volume plus tidal volume,Expiratory reserve volume and Residual volume,C,Vital capacity equals IRV plus TV plus ERV
respiratory system,152,"A 72 year old farmer presented with a history of massive haemoptysis. A CXR reveals a right upper lobe cavitating mass. His aspergillus precipitins are positive and a diagnosis of aspergilloma is made. If there is massive haemoptysis, in a patient with poor pulmonary reserve, what management should be initiated?",Intracavitary amphotericin,Emergency surgery,Fluconazole,Bronchial artery embolisation,Itraconzole,D,In massive haemoptysis in a patient with poor pulmonary or cardiac reserve bronchial artery embolisation should be tried. Emergency lobar resection is another option but mortality and morbidity are higher in those who have significant comorbidity. A long oral course of itraconazole can be utilised when patients become symptomatic of an aspergilloma but is not useful in this acute setting. Intracavitary catheters with instillation of amphotericin B are being trialled but again not for the acute setting.
respiratory system,153,Caplans syndrome refers to?,Bronchial cancer secondary to pneumoconiosis,Coal miners penumoconiosis,Silicosis and bronchial cancer,SLE and pneumoconiosis,Rheumatoid lung nodules and pneumoconiosis,E,Caplans syndrome is a combination of rheumatoid arthritis and pneumoconiosis. This results in intrapulmonary nodules.
respiratory system,154,"A 45-year-old woman is referred to the respiratory clinic with shortness of breath. She has been unable to work due to a long term back injury and is therefore on long term sickness benefit. On examination her BP is 155/85 mmHg, pulse is 85 and regular. Her BMI is 32, there is bilateral lower limb pitting oedema with varicose vein formation. Heart sounds are normal, auscultation of the chest is clear. Investigations show:    pH 7.43 (7.35 - 7.45)   PCO2 5.8 kPa (4.8 - 6.1)   pO2 9.9 kPa (10 13.3)    Which of the following is likely to be the most effective therapy?",Furosemide,Salbutamol,Seretide,Tiotropium,Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC),E,"Given this woman's obesity, slowly progressive shortness of breath, absence of chest signs, and presence of peripheral oedema and varicose veins, chronic pulmonary emboli are the most likely possibility. As such anticoagulation is the optimal long term strategy to reduce the risk of further clots. She should also be encouraged to lose a significant amount of weight. Salbutamol and Seretide are treatments for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and tiotropium is a treatment for COPD alone, therefore none of the three are appropriate here. We are given no history of wheeze or cough which fits with either COPD or asthma as the underlying diagnosis. Whilst furosemide may relieve peripheral oedema, it will not have a positive effect on the underlying cause of right heart failure."
respiratory system,155,A 67-year-old man with history of weight loss complains of hoarseness of voice. CT reveals opacity in the right upper mediastinum. He denied any history of difficulty breathing. What is the single mostappropriate investigation?,Laryngoscopy,Bronchoscopy,LN biopsy,Bronchoalevolar lavage,Barium swallow,C,There is weight loss and there is an opacity in right upper mediastinum. May indicate enlarged lymph node or lymphoma causing pressure on right recurrent laryngeal nerve resulting in horseness. As CT didn't reveal any bronchial lesion and no breathing difficulty it is unlikely to be a bronchial pathology. So CT guided lymph node biopsy can reveal the diagnosis
respiratory system,156,"In a study of a new drug for asthma, a researcher wishes to compare average serum drug concentrations in volunteers, four hours after taking the drug;  in the fasting state, then after a meal.  Which of the following would be the most appropriate statistical test to use?",Chi-squared test,Pearson's correlation coefficient,Student's paired t test,Student's unpaired t test,Wilcoxon test,C,"In this scenario, we are dealing with use of the drug in the same volunteers with the intervention being the effect of feeding on drug concentrations. Thus you will be comparing means in the same subjects and the paired t test would be the most appropriate test. "
respiratory system,157,"A 48 year old gentleman presents with extreme tiredness and difficulty concentrating. His wife states he is irritable and he is a very loud snorer and occasionally chokes during the night. His libido is low, he is suffering from headaches and he has been falling asleep during the day as he feels very unrefreshed after his sleep. His BMI is 35. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Obstructive sleep apnoea,Hypothyroidism,Sleep deprivation,Depression,Narcolepsy,A,"The diagnosis is obstructive sleep apnoea and these symptoms are classically of this. There is nothing to suggest he is sleep deprived and this does not lead to features such as snoring and headache. Depression, narcolepsy and hypothyroidism similarly do not lead to the extreme day time tiredness, snoring and id choking episodes. Risk factors for its development including male sex, middle aged, smoking, obesity, sedative drugs and excess alcohol consumption. It is diagnosed via polysomnography whereby physiological recordings are made during sleep and the number of apnoea/hypopnoea episodes are measured. It is associated with hypertension, IHD, stroke, metabolic syndrome and diabetes. OSA can lead to RTAs due to daytime sleepiness and it can lead to pulmonary hypertension and corpulmonale. Lifestyle advice such as weight loss, smoking cessation and reduced alcohol advice should be given. Other management options include intra oral devices to anterior displace the mandible and surgical techniques have been utilised. OSA can lead to significant hypoxia over night and night time CPAP may be required."
respiratory system,158,"A 42 year old male is admitted for treatment of a community acquired pneumonia. He had been making a good recovery when 3 days into admission he spikes a temperature and is complaining of pleuritic chest pain. A CXR reveals a right sided pleural effusion. A pleural tap is performed and is purulent with the fluid having a pH of less than 7.2, low glucose and elevated LDH. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Empyema,Parapneumonic Effusion,Haemothorax,Pneumonia Recurrence,Pneumothorax,A,The history should raise suspicion of an empyema. The CXR reveals a pleural effusion and the pleural tap is highly suggestive of an empyema. Samples should be sent for culture. Patients should be commenced on IV antibiotics and an intercostal chest drain inserted.
respiratory system,159,"A 74-year-old man is admitted to the Emergency department after collapsing in church. On reviewing his notes you see this is the third time that it has happened in the past eight months, and each time it is when he is dressed in a suit. There is a past medical history of hypertension but nil else of note. According to a bystander his pulse seemed very slow at the time of the collapse. On examination his BP is 135/70 mmHg, his pulse is 80 and regular. General physical review is unremarkable. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 132 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 7.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 282 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 135 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 123 µmol/L (79-118)    ECG shows old inferior myocardial infarction. Chest x ray is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most appropriate next investigation?",Ambulatory ECG monitoring,CT head,EEG,Exercise test,Tilt table test,A,"The history of collapse raises the possibility of a rhythm disturbance, although the fact he collapses only when wearing his suit raises the possibility of carotid sinus hypersensitivity, with attacks related to the wearing of a tight collar. The first step when each of these diagnoses is considered is the same however, with ambulatory ECG monitoring to discharge the risk of arrhythmia. A TIA or fit is unlikely, as his recovery period is short, and we have the collateral history of slow pulse which comes from a bystander. As such, EEG or CT head are not next step investigations. A tilt table test is the definitive investigation for carotid sinus hypersensitivity, but would only be considered after other cardiac causes have been excluded. Whilst myocardial ischaemia is a possibility, an exercise test would not necessarily be the next investigation of choice."
respiratory system,160,"A 54-year-old woman with multiple medical problems attends the respiratory clinic with increasing shortness of breath. Medication of note includes dosulepin, omeprazole, amlodipine, ramipril, and atorvastatin. On examination her BP is 132/78 mmHg, pulse is 72 and regular. There are scattered inspiratory crackles throughout both lung fields. Pulmonary function testing reveals a restrictive defect. Which of the following agents is most likely to be responsible?",Amlodipine,Penicillamine,Dosulepin,Omeprazole,Ramipril,C,"Dosulepin is recognised as a very rare cause of pulmonary fibrosis. Both subacute interstitial pneumonia and acute alveolitis have been reported in association with dosulepin therapy. None of the other agents listed are recognised as causes of pulmonary fibrosis.

Consequently, pO2 is slightly low. The most probable cause out of those given is pyloric stenosis."
respiratory system,163,"In restrictive lung disease due to respiratory muscle weakness, which of the following statements is true?","Low FEV1/FVC, high RV/TLC","Low FEV1/FVC, normal TLC","Low VC, low FEV1, normal TLC, low RV/TLC","Low VC, low RV, low TLC","Low VC, low TLC, high RV/TLC",E,"In restrictive lung disease due to respiratory muscle weakness the lung itself can function normally but muscle weakness will result in grossly low lung volumes including forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and total lung capacity (TLC). However residual volume (RV) will be relatively high as a consequence of this weakness. Consequently, RV/TLC will be elevated. However the transfer of carbon monoxide (TCO) will be unaffected."
respiratory system,164,An 87-year-old woman was being treated for chronic bronchial asthma. Her daughter wants to talk to you about pneumococcal vaccination. She can't remember whether her mother has taken the vaccine in the past. The medical records are also somewhat doubtful on that aspect. The woman has allergy to egg proteins. What is the best course of action in this case? ,Egg allergy is a contraindication to the vaccine,Give her one dose of PPV23,Give her PCV13 followed by PPV23,No need to give the vaccine,She should be given two doses of PPV23,C,"Adults 65 years and older, especially with chronic respiratory conditions, like the present case, should receive the pneumococcal vaccine. Now PCV13 is given first, followed by PPV23 at least one year later.  Egg allergy is not a contraindication to pneumococcal vaccine; it is a contraindication to i.m. influenza vaccine. Usually, the guidelines for elders is to give a dose of PCV13 first, followed by PPV23. Pneumococcal vaccine is usually advisable now, especially in patients with chronic respiratory diseases. Two doses of PPV23 is not given now to patients over 65 years of age. It is one dose of PCV13, followed by one dose of PPV23. Some patients may have received PPV23 before 65 years of age. For them, the PPV23 is given again, at least five years after last dose of PPV23. "
respiratory system,165,A tall thin young man has sudden pain in the chest and becomes breathless while crying. What is the single most appropriate investigation?,Cardiac enzymes,CXR,CT,ECG,V/Q scan,B,tall thin young men are particularly prone to develop pneumothorax. Sudden pain and breathlessness in this young man are highly suggestive of pneumothorax. So investigation of choice is CXR
respiratory system,166,"A 52 year old presents with normally well controlled asthma presents with, shortness of breath, wheeze and nocturnal cough.  He has noticed coughing up blood on several occasions.  He also complains of feeling generally unwell with a headache and fever.  Bloods reveal an elevated eosinophil count and IgE.

Which of the following will confirm the diagnosis?",High resolution CT,Autoantibodies,Serology for aspergillus precipitins,Pulmonary function tests,Lung biopsy,C,"This patient presents with features of deteriorating asthma with haemoptysis, general malaise and headache. This is inkeeping with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. There is evidence of eosinophilia, increased IgE and infiltrates CXR therefore either skin test for aspergillus or serology showing elevated precipitins to aspergillus will be useful in confirming the diagnosis."
respiratory system,167,An 80-year-old coal miner who stopped working 16 years previously presents with deteriorating dyspnoea. Investigations show:    FEV1 1.4 L (predicted 2.5)   FVC 2.8 L (predicted 3.0)    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Silicosis,Simple pneumoconiosis,A,Both this man's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) are reduced. The ratio of FEV1/FVC is also reduced at 50%. This indicates airways obstruction. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the only condition above that results in airways obstruction. Although no smoking history is given this may be expected and with his occupation these are risk factors for the development of COPD.
respiratory system,168,"A 42-year-old man presented to his GP with increasing shortness of breath. He has been previously noted to have a raised ALT, which was put down by the GP to a problem with excessive drinking. He was given a salbutamol inhaler which brought about some relief, particularly when he was playing football with his friends, but most recently he has had to give up due to reduced exercise tolerance. On examination his BP is 142/82 mmHg. He is thin with a BMI of 19 kg/m^2, and his chest looks hyper-expanded. There is scattered wheeze throughout both lung fields. Abdominal examination is normal. Investigations show    Hb 129 g/L (135-180)   WCC 8.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   PLT 203 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 138 mmol/L (134-143)   K 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Cr 110 μmol/L (60-120)   FEV1 70% of predicted   FEV1/FVC 60% of predicted    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,Asthma,Chronic bronchiectasis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),A,"This man's abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) raises the possibility of accelerated liver disease, characterised by accelerated hepatic fibrosis/cirrhosis as a result of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. Additionally, his lung function tests fit the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As such, emphysema is the most likely underlying respiratory diagnosis. It is likely that he has the PiMS, PiMZ or PiSS genotype. Replacement alpha-1 antitrypsin is available, although its cost effectiveness and long term clinical effectiveness is yet to be established. IPF would not affects his liver function and PBC would not affect his lung function."

respiratory system,173,"A 61-year-old heavy smoker with a BMI of 37 kg/m^2 presents with impotence, nocturia and depression. He is hypoxic at rest on air and has ankle oedema. Which is the most appropriate investigation to determine the aetiology?",Arterial blood gas,Chest x ray,Sleep study,Thyroid function test,Ventilation–perfusion scan,C,"The combination of obesity and hypoxia in this scenario should lead you to consider obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) as a diagnosis. Sleep apnoea is defined as repeated episodes of obstructive apnoea and hypopnoea during sleep, together with daytime sleepiness or altered cardiopulmonary function. It affects 2-4% of middle aged adults, although it is important to note that a significant proportion of cases probably go undiagnosed. Obstructive sleep apnoea has been increasingly implicated in the initiation and progression of cardiovascular diseases. The repeated nocturnal hypoxaemia is associated with activation of a number of neural, humoral, thrombotic, metabolic and inflammatory mechanisms. Patients have an increased risk of diurnal hypertension, nocturnal dysrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, right and left ventricular failure, myocardial infarction and stroke. The hypoxaemia, catecholamine surges and increased blood pressure during sleep, together with daytime hypertension may predispose to hypertensive heart disease, which can manifest as either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. Systolic dysfunction can also be induced by inflammatory cytokines, and increases in afterload and myocardial wall stress caused by negative intrathoracic pressure during episodes of obstruction. Fatigue, irritability and personality change have also been attributed to nocturnal desaturation and chronic sleep deprivattion. Nocturia and erectile dysfunction are also symptoms of OSA. A sleep-study is used to confirm the presence of upper airway closure during sleep, and lab-based polysomnography is the gold standard for diagnosis. Increasingly, home monitoring systems may be used. Arterial blood gases vary depending on the time taken, and whether cor pulmonale has developed. The findings are not specific. Whilst a chest x ray is important when presented with a patient with hypoxia, it will not help with the diagnosis of OSA. Hypothyroidism could account for this gentleman's depression and erectile dysfunction, but OSA is a much more likely diagnosis. Ventilation-perfusion scans are used in the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli, although are being increasingly replaced by CTPAs. Whilst recurrent pulmonary thromboembolism can lead to cor pulmonale this does not fit the clinical scenario presented here. Therapeutic strategies for OSA are behavioural (avoid alcohol and strategies, weight loss etc.), medical (positive airway pressure, oral appliances) and surgical (tracheostomy, palatal and maxillofacial procedures). Treatment decisions are based on daytime symptoms and cardiopulmonary function. The goals are to establish normal nocturnal oxygenation and ventilation, abolish snoring and eliminate disruption of sleep. "
respiratory system,174,"In tension pneumothorax, which one of the following signs is present?",Bradycardia,Collapsed neck veins,Hyper-resonance to percussion on the affected side,Hypocapnia,Tracheal deviation to the ipsilateral side,C,In a tension pneumothorax air accumulates under pressure in the pleural space leading to shift of the mediastinum to the contralateral side. The raised intrathoracic pressure affects all chambers of the heart. Venous return is impaired and the neck veins may distend. Cardiac output is reduced. This causes hypotension and a tachycardia. The classical clinical signs are:  Reduced breath sounds and hyper-resonance to percussion on the affected side Tracheal shift to the contralateral side Distended neck veins  This is a clinical diagnosis. Do not take a chest x ray. The treatment is immediate needle thoracocentesis followed by insertion of a chest drain.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Berylliosis,COPD,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Sarcoidosis,B,"Exposure to beryllium is seen in the nuclear power, telecommunications, semi-conductor and electronics industries. It results in a similar clinical picture to that of sarcoidosis; in this case it is the patient's occupation that pushes us towards berylliosis as the most appropriate answer. Sarcoidosis is the major differential here, but it is the possible exposure to beryllium because of occupation which points us away from this as the most likely diagnosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis would be associated with evidence of interstitial fibrosis on chest x ray. We are not told of any smoking history consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and there is no evidence of wheeze to suggest asthma."

On examination he is mildly short of breath at rest. There is finger clubbing and bilateral inspiratory crackles on auscultation of the chest. It is noted on his pulmonary function testing that the DLCO is reduced. Which of the following is likely most to affect interpretation of the test?,Consumption of two units of alcohol the night before the test,Mild kyphosis,Mild scoliosis,Smoking on the morning of the test,Use of salbutamol,D,"Although the conventional single breath diffusing capacity (DLCO) has been accepted as a standard non-invasive test to assess the integrity of pulmonary function, there are numerous pitfalls in its use. One such pitfall is the effect of carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke, which raises carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) to as high as 10-15% (normal value 1-2%). Most regression values for DLCO are derived from the study of lifetime non-smokers, so that the use of these in smokers underestimates the percent of predicted DLCO values, unless additional adjustments are made. Increasing COHb reduces DLCO because carbon monoxide (CO) is substantially increased, leading to a reduced driving pressure for CO across the air-blood barrier. In addition, some of the patient's haemoglobin (Hb) will already be tightly bound by CO and therefore the overall amount of Hb available for binding by the test CO is decreased. Whilst alcohol vapours can interfere with interpretation of the test it is highly unlikely that two units of alcohol consumed the night before will have any impact at all. Severe kyphosis and scoliosis can affect interpretation of the test, therefore DLCO should be adjusted according to the calculated alveolar volume. However, mild thoracic cage abnormalities are unlikely to have significant effects. Salbutamol should not affect the results. "
respiratory system,187,A 54 year old male presents with increased shortness of breath and cough. He is a smoker of 40 per day and has previously been treated for Hodgkins Lymphoma. On examination there is bibasal fine inspiratory crackles. Spirometry reveals a normal FEV1/FVC ratio and reduced gas transfer. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pulmonary fibrosis secondary to Hodgkins Lymphoma,Bronchial carcinoma,COPD,Asthma,Pulmonary fibrosis secondary to Bleomycin,E,"The picture on spirometry is that of a restrictive pattern thus COPD, Asthma and bronchial carcinoma are unlikely. The clinical findings are also indicative of pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin is utilised in the treatment of Hodgkins lymphoma can lead to pulmonary fibrosis."
respiratory system,188,A man is referred to the medical admission unit with increasing breathlessness over the last six months since starting work as a stablehand at a new yard. He reports initially symptoms of dyspnoea in the evenings with a dry cough. He has also noted occasional fevers at night. His breathing has become steadily worse. A chest x ray is performed which shows some fluffy nodular shadowing. What is the most likely causative agent for his condition?,Avian proteins,Epicoccum nigrum,Klebsiella,Penicillium species,Thermophilic Actinomyces bacteria,E,"The most common example of allergic alveolitis is farmer's lung. This is caused by dust from mouldy hay contaminated with thermophilic Actinomyces bacteria, and as a stablehand this patient is likely to have been in close contact with this allergen. Typically symptoms tend to occur several hours after exposure. Chest x ray may demonstrate fluffy nodular shadowing or ground glass appearances. Avian proteins are the allergen responsible for pigeon fancier's lung. Penicillium species are responsible for respiratory disease in cheese and cork workers and are due to fungal contaminants of materials. Klebsiella and Epicoccum nigrum are other bacterial causes of allergic alveolitis and are found in contaminated water, wood shavings, etc."
respiratory system,189,A 74-year-old smoker presented to his GP with cough and shortness of breath. Exam revealed pigmentation of the oral mucosa and also over the palms and soles. Tests show that he is diabetic and hypokalemic. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Pseudocushing syndrome,Conns disease,Ectopic ACTH,Cushing disease,Hypothyroidism,C,The patient probably developed small cell lung cancer which is working as a tumour producing ectopic ACTH. Hyperpigmentation is caused by high levels of circulating ACTH that bind to the melanocortin 1 receptor on the surface of dermal melanocytes. Ectopic ACTH induced raised cortisole is leading to diabetes and hypokalemia. A variant of Cushing's disease can be caused by ectopic ACTH production from a small-cell lung cancer
respiratory system,190,"A 32-year-old woman is admitted from a party complaining of extreme light-headedness and pleuritic chest pain she also says she has pins and needles in both hands. She has a past history of asthma which is controlled with a beclomethasone inhaler and prn salbutamol. On examination her BP is 110/72mmHg, her pulse is 95 and regular. There is scattered wheeze on auscultation of her chest but good air entry bilaterally. Her peak flow is 500, (580 predicted). Investigations show:    pH 7.52 (7.35 - 7.45)   PCO2 3.5 kPa (4.8 - 6.1)   pO2 12.9 kPa (10 - 13.3)    Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy with respect to reducing the likelihood of future attendance in the Emergency department?",Diaphragmatic breathing exercises,Diazepam,Fluoxetine,Montelukast,Seretide,A,"This patient is hyperventilating as judged by her symptoms, (peripheral numbness, pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath), and arterial blood gasses. There is only a minor reduction in peak flow. In this case, teaching diaphragmatic breathing, (as opposed to thoracic breathing which is practised by many asthmatics), may significantly impact on symptoms. Diazepam is not recommended in this case as it does not address the underlying problem responsible for her presentation, (likely thoracic breathing). Fluoxetine is effective in treating anxiety but from the presentation described it does not appear that anxiety / depression is a significant driver. Whilst montelukast and Seretide are appropriate steps up in asthma therapy, there is only a small reduction in peak flow from that predicted; as such neither is indicated here."
respiratory system,191,A 22 year old presents with sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain. He is not breathless and his saturations are 100%. A Chest Xray reveals a small pneumothorax which is less than 2cm rim. How should this patient be managed?,High flow oxygen,Admit for observation,Aspiration,Outpatient follow up,Chest drain,D,If a patient is not breathless and the rim of air is less than 2cm then the patient can be discharged and monitored as an outpatient with repeat CXR.
respiratory system,192,"A 45-year-old woman solicitor presents with shortness of breath and a dry cough. She has been treated by her GP with a salbutamol inhaler but tells you that this has made no difference at all to her symptoms. In addition she has an itchy raised rash on both shins. On examination her BP is 145/82 mmHg, pulse is 80 and regular. Her BMI is 28. Lungs appear normal on auscultation. There is a rash on her shins consistent with erythema nodosum. Which of the following investigations is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",AAFB staining,Bronchoalveolar lavage,CT thorax,Serum ACE,Transbronchial biopsy,E,"A dry cough with the presence of erythema nodosum raises the possibility of sarcoidosis. You are asked to specify the investigation most likely to confirm the diagnosis, as such only transbronchial biopsy will determine whether non-caseating granulomas are present or not. AAFB staining would be confirmatory for a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Given this woman is a solicitor, it is less likely she has had significant TB exposure versus sarcoidosis. Bronchoalveolar lavage may demonstrate increased lymphocytes, although this is a non-specific finding. Serum ACE is raised in 60% of patients with sarcoidosis. Transbronchial biopsy is therefore the definitive route to confirming the diagnosis."
respiratory system,193,A 17-year-old girl with known cystic fibrosis presents with a chest infection. Which antibiotic would be most suitable for her?,Amoxicillin,Augmentin,Cefotaxime,Ceftazidime,Gentamicin,D,"In cystic fibrosis the airways become obstructed by thick mucus due to defective chloride secretion and increased sodium resorption. This leads to bacterial colonisation early in life. The bacteria present depend on the age of the patient: infants and young children become colonised by Staphylococcus aureus and then Haemophilus influenzae. In teenagers, Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonisation occurs. Other organisms which can cause infection include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Burkholdia cepacia (which confers a worse prognosis), Mycobacterium tuberculosis, other mycobacteria, Aspergillus fumigatus, and viruses. In the UK, antibiotics are usually given when the sputum becomes purulent, pulmonary function deteriorates, or the patient is unwell (e.g. weight loss). In this age group, Pseudomonal cover is needed and a combination of intravenous antibiotics is used to reduce the risk of resistance developing. The usual combination is ceftazidime and tobramycin, for a period of two weeks. Cefotaxime, augmentin, and amoxicillin do not have pseudomonal cover. Gentamicin can be used in place of tobramycin, but has poorer pseudomonal cover and is associated with significant side effects (nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity). Sputum samples should be obtained, and organism identification and sensitivities can be used to guide treatment of future exacerbations. "
respiratory system,194,"A 35 year old male who is a non smoker presents with increasing shortness of breath. He complains of a productive cough especially over the winter months. Pulmonary function tests reveal an obstructive pattern. He states his father and grandfather both had ""problems with their breathing"". What is the most likely diagnosis?",Malignancy,Multiple recurrent pulmonary emboli,Asthma,Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency,COPD,D,A patient presenting with features of COPD at a young age who is a non smoker and where there is a family history should raise suspicion of alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency. Patients present at a young age with COPD features. Liver disease is also common and can lead to cirrhosis.
respiratory system,195,The sniff test is useful in the diagnosis of which of the following?,COPD,Asthma,Phrenic nerve palsy,Guillain Barre syndrome,Pharyngeal pouch,C,During fluoroscopy a patient is asked to sniff and there is a paradoxical rise of the paralysed hemidiaphragm. This confirms a phrenic nerve palsy.
respiratory system,196,"Which of the following drugs utilised for the management of Tuberculosis, can lead to a visual disturbance?",Streptomycin,Pyrazinamide,Ethambutol,Rifampicin,Isoniazid,C,Ethambutol can cause a dose related optic retrobulbar neuritis which leads to a reduced visual acuity and central scotoma.
respiratory system,197,Which of the following statements regarding idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is correct?,80% of patients initially respond well to immunosuppression,Active inflammation may be suggested by a CT scan,Lung volumes show a raised residual volume/total lung capacity ratio,Peak flow rate is a good guide to severity,Peak incidence seen in the fourth decade,B,"About 50% of patients have an improvement in their symptoms with steroids and 25% have improved lung function. A recent study has suggested this treatment may actually be associated with an increased mortality, but further studies are required before this is widely accepted. High-resolution CT scans can be used to determine the stage of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. When ground glass attenuation predominates, it usually represents an inflammatory cell infiltrate which has been shown to respond well to treatment. As the disease progresses it develops a reticular appearance which represents irreversible fibrotic changes. The presence of a predominantly ground glass appearance is also an independent predictor of survival. Both total lung capacity (TLC) and residual volume (RV) reduce with restrictive disorders like idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, so the ratio is maintained. A raised RV/TLC ratio suggests a combination of airways obstruction and restrictive defect not just idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis as mentioned in this question. Peak flow measure airway obstruction. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is characterised by a restrictive defect on lung function testing. Peak incidence is in the sixth decade. "
respiratory system,198,With which of the following is obstructive sleep apnoea characteristically associated?,Hypersomnolence,Impotence,Insomnia,Macrognathia,Polydipsia,A,"The dominant symptom is hypersomnolence (sleepiness). Other more common symptoms include:  Apparent personality changes Witnessed apnoeas, and True nocturnal polyuria.  Reduced libido is less common. Sleep apnoea may be associated with:  Acromegaly Myxoedema Obesity, and Micrognathia/retrognathia.  "
respiratory system,199,A 65-year-old patient attending pre-operative assessment tells you he has had shortness of breath for the last week. The chest x ray shows right lower lobe consolidation. Which of the following features should prompt you to consider admission to hospital?,Audible bronchial breathing,A PaO2 of 9.8 kPa (11-13),A respiratory rate of 32/min,A SaO2 of 95%,A white cell count of 16.8 ×10^9/L (4-10),C,"The British Thoracic Society guidelines on community acquired pneumonia in adults recommend use of the CURB-65. This is a 5-point score, one point for each of:  Confusion Urea more than 7 mmol/L Respiratory rate 30/min or more Systolic Blood pressure below 90 mmHg (or diastolic below 60 mmHg) Age 65 years or older.  If the CURB score is 0 (0.6% mortality) or 1 (1.5% mortality) the patient can be managed as an outpatient. A CURB score of 2 has a mortality of 9.2%. The patient should be admitted or have closely supervised outpatient treatment. A CURB score of 3 or more puts the patient at high risk of death (22% mortality) and hospital admission is mandatory."
respiratory system,200,"A 27-year-old man presents with chest pain and respiratory distress. Examination: tachycardia, hypotension and neck vein distension. Trachea is deviated to the left side, breath sounds on right side are absent and diminished on left side. What is the next appropriate management?",CXR,Right side aspiration (16G),Left side aspiration (16G),Right side drain with a small tube (12F),Left side drain with a small tube (12F),B,Diagnosis is right sided massive pneumothorax
respiratory system,201,"A 56-year-old lady with lung cancer presents with urinary retention, postural hypotension, diminished reflexes and sluggish pupillary reaction. What is the most likely explanation for her symptoms?",Paraneoplastic syndrome,Progression of lung cancer,Brain metastasis,Hyponatremia,Spinal cord compression,A,Features given are well known features of autonomic neuropathy which can be a result of paraneoplastic syndrome
respiratory system,202,"A 19-year-old intravenous drug user presents to the emergency department with a fever of 38.5°C, dyspnoea, and right sided pleuritic chest pain. Bilateral cavitating lesions are seen in both lungs on his chest x ray. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aspiration pneumonia,Endocarditis of the tricuspid valve,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP),Pulmonary embolic disease,Pulmonary tuberculosis,B,"PCP can be excluded as it does not present in this manner. Aspiration pneumonia is more likely to show a single abscess cavity rather than multiple bilateral lesions. The patient is certainly at higher risk of TB and this is difficult to exclude without additional information regarding constitutional symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, etc). Pulmonary emboli could arise in this situation, but the chest radiograph is typically normal in that situation. If PEs do result in any change on CXR it is usually in the form of wedge shaped infarcts.  The best answer, therefore, is that these cavities are due to septic emboli arising from infection on the tricuspid valve. Systemic embolisation occurs in 20-50% of cases of infective endocarditis, and can involve the lungs, central nervous system , coronary arteries, spleen, bowel and extremities. This highest incidence of emboli is seen with aortic and mitral valve infections, due to S. aureus, Candida, HACEK and Abiotrophia. Most occur within the first 2-4 weeks of therapy. "
respiratory system,203,Which of the following statements is not true of primary pulmonary tuberculosis?,A positive tuberculin skin test develops within two weeks of infection,It is characteristically asymptomatic,Miliary spread is commoner in a younger age group,If Pleural effusion occur with infection this is before tuberculin skin testing is positive,The initial immunological response causes hilar lymphadenopathy,A,Primary TB is usually asymptomatic with miliary TB most likely to occur in young children. The Ghon focus is the area of consolidation from cellular infiltration and response to uptake of organisms by macrophages which transform into epithelioid cells and group into granulomata. Bacilli are transported via lymphatics early in the disease process to regional lymph nodes to cause marked lymphadenopathy. Pleural and pericardial infections (which can result in effusions) occur at or shortly after primary infection. Positive tuberculin test occurs between three weeks and three months after primary infection.
respiratory system,204,A 70-year-old man admits to asbestos exposure 20 years ago and has attempted to quit smoking. He has noted weight loss and hoarseness of voice. Choose the single most likely type of cancer along with risk factors present.,Basal cell carcinoma,Bronchial carcinoma,Esophageal carcinoma,Nasopharyngeal carcinoma,Oral carcinoma,B,Asbestos exposure is a risk factor for lung cancer and also has a synergistic effect with cigarette smoke. Horseness can be from involvement of recurrent laryngeal nerve
respiratory system,205,A 63-year-old woman presents with a five day history of progressive shortness of breath. Her family brought her in because she was increasingly sleepy during the last 24 hours. She was diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) three years ago and has a FEV1 less than 50% of predicted. She has an oxygen concentrator at home. Examination revealed depressed consciousness and a respiratory rate of 24 with shallow breaths. There were decreased breath sounds with minimal air movement. If an arterial blood gas on room air were to be performed which of the following results would you expect?,pH 7.16 paCO2 70 paO2 50 HCO3 24,pH 7.24 paCO2 80 paO2 55 HCO3 30,pH 7.32 paCO2 60 paO2 70 HCO3 30,pH 7.41 paCO2 40 paO2 50 HCO3 24,pH 7.48 paCO2 30 paO2 85 HCO3 24,B,"This patient's presentation suggests that she has developed acute carbon dioxide retention and would be expected to have a low pH, low pO2, high pCO2 and a high HCO3 because she has longstanding COPD. Consequently the last three options really do not fit. The first option has a pretty much normal bicarbonate and this would be expected to be much higher in chronic COPD (as there would be metabolic alkalosis to compensate for the respiratory acidosis). Therefore this leaves the best fit as the second option."
respiratory system,206,A 45-year-old male with type 2 diabetes presented to the clinic as his wife complained that he snored excessively. Which of the following would suggest a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnoea ?,Daytime sleepiness ,Nasal polyps,Nocturnal cough,Poor memory,Stridor ,A,"The typical problem associated with sleep apnoea syndrome is excessive daytime somnolence, associated with:  Obesity Acromegaly Hypothyroidism  Cushing's syndrome.  It is thought that the somnolence is due to the interruption of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep by frequent episodes of waking due to apnoeic episodes."
respiratory system,207,Which of the following is a common feature of severe pulmonary embolism?,Anterior T wave inversion on the electrocardiogram,Increased left atrial pressure,Long PR interval on the electrocardiogram,Metabolic alkalosis,Tricuspid incompetence,A,"In most cases of pumonary embolism there is just a sinus tachycardia on the ECG. In severe cases (e.g. right atrial dilatation and right ventricular hypertrophy/dilatation) there may be a change in the electrical axis characterised by an S wave in lead I and a Q wave and T wave inversion in lead III (S1Q3T3), sinus tachycardia, T wave inversion in leads V1-V3, (precordial/anterior leads over the right ventricle) and small QRS complexes. A long PR interval on the electrocardiogram indicates first degree heart block. It is also associated with hypokalaemia. There may be decreased left atrial pressure if the PE is massive. There may be a metabolic acidosis. Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure may be the presenting features of multiple pulmonary emboli."
respiratory system,208,"You are examining rates of Aspergillus positive sputum samples received at the hospital as part of an audit. With respect to increasing the positive test rate, which of the following is most likely to be associated with Aspergillus colonisation?",Asthma,Bronchial carcinoma,COPD,Cystic fibrosis,HIV,D,One Australian study suggested that colonisation rates for Aspergillus in patients with cystic fibrosis approach 19%. Rates of ABPA however are much lower at around 5%. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) rates are lower in patients with obstructive lung disease at around 1%. HIV patients with a known history of P. jirovecii are at increased risk of aspergilloma. Bronchial carcinoma is not particularly associated with aspergillus positivity.
respiratory system,209,"A 43-year-old woman presents to the respiratory clinic with increasing shortness of breath and a dry cough. She also has fever and night sweats which have worsened over the past six to nine months and has lost a few kg in weight. On examination her BMI is 23, BP is 135/72 mmHg, pulse is 73, and there are scattered crackles on auscultation of the chest. She also has erythema nodosum on examination of both lower limbs. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 121 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 9.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 192 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 108 µmol/L (79-118)   pH 7.41 (7.35-7.45)   pCO2 4.7 kPa (4.8-6.1)   pO2 9.8 kPa (10-13.3)   CRX Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy    Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?",Azathioprine,Hydroxychloroquine,Infliximab,Methotrexate,Prednisolone,E,"This patient has sarcoidosis as evidenced by the hilar lymphadenopathy, erythema nodosum and mild hypoxia on blood gas analysis. Prednisolone is the mainstay of initial treatment for sarcoid, continued for 12 months or more in those patients who respond, but tapered to the minimal effective dose. All of the other agents have been used in the management of sarcoidosis, although they are all subsidiary to use of corticosteroids. Systematic reviews have not so far however supported the use of any particular second line agent. Methotrexate and infliximab are commonly used in Rheumatoid arthritis.  Azathioprine is commonly used in inflammatory bowel disorders."
respiratory system,210,A 26-year-old man presents to emergency department with increasing shortness of breath on left side and chest pain. He has been a heavy smoker for the past 4 years. He doesn’t have any past medical history. What is the likely diagnosis?,Pulmonary embolism,MI,Asthma,Pleural effusion,Pneumothorax,E,"A pneumothorax occurs when air leaks into the space between parietal and visceral pleura. This air pushes on the outside of the lung and makes it collapse. It may be complete collapse or partial. A pneumothorax can be idiopathic or caused by a blunt or penetrating chest injury, certain medical procedures, or damage from underlying lung disease and rupture of subpleural blebs. The main symptoms of a pneumothorax are sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. Pneumothorax may be i. spontaneous pneumothorax ii. Iatrogenic pneumothorax and iii. tension pneumothorax. History and physical examination remain the keys to making the diagnosis of pneumothorax. Chest X-ray is most commonly used. In given caseIncreased shortness of breath and chest pain with no past medical history favours the diagnosis of pneumothorax. Heavy smoking or tobacco is a risk factor for spontaneous pneumothorax"
respiratory system,211,"A 56 year old with recently diagnoses COPD presents with shortness of breath and wheeze. Blood gases reveal a PO2 of 8.6 kPa, PCO2 of 6.8 kPa, Ph of 7.25 and a bicarbonate of 24. What do these gases indicate?",Metabolic acidosis,Respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation,Acute on chronic respiratory acidosis,Respiratory alkalosis,Acute respiratory acidosis,E,"This is likely a COPD exacerbation. Gases indicate an acidosis due to the low pH and, high CO2 indicates a respiratory cause. The bicarbonate is normal so there is no evidence of metabolic compensation."
respiratory system,212,"A 16-year-old girl presents with an acute exacerbation of asthma. On examination her respiratory rate was 30 per minute, her heart rate was 120 beats per minute and a peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) was 30% of the predicted value. Her blood gas analysis on air shows:    PaO2 9 kPa (11.3-12.6)   PaCO2 3.5 kPa (4.7-6.0)    After the administration of oxygen and corticosteroids what is the most appropriate next step in management?",Intravenous aminophylline,Intravenous salbutamol,Ipratropium bromide via oxygen-driven nebuliser,Salbutamol via oxygen-driven nebuliser,Salmeterol via breath-actuated inhaler,D,"This patient fits the criteria for acute severe asthma. In such cases β2-agonists should be administered as soon as possible, preferably nebulised driven by oxygen. Repeat doses should be given at 15-30 minute intervals, or continuous nebulisation can be used where there is inadequate response to bolus therapy. Nebulised ipratropium bromide should be added for patients with acute severe or life threatening asthma, or those with a poor initial response. It's addition produces significantly greater bronchodilation than a β2-agonist alone. Oxygen should be given to maintain saturations at 94-98%. Patients with saturations less than 92% on air should have an ABG to exclude hypercapnia. However, starting treatment should not be delayed to do the ABG. Initially high-flow oxygen is used, and then weaned to maintain adequate saturations. Unless you suspect COPD there is no need to be cautious with oxygen therapy. Steroids reduce mortality, relapses, subsequent hospital admission and requirement for β2-agonists^1. The earlier they are given in the attack, the better the outcome. A dose of 40-50 mg should therefore be given once oxygen and nebuliser therapy has been established. This should be continued for 5 days, or until recovery, and can then be stopped abruptly unless the patient has taken long-term oral corticosteroids. Failure to respond to the above treatment steps may warrant the use of intravenous magnesium sulphate and aminophylline. However, these should not be used without discussion with your senior colleagues. Intensive care is indicated for patients with severe acute or life threatening asthma who are failing to respond to therapy. Consider it in patients with deteriorating peak flow, persisting or worsening hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, exhaustion or altered conscious state. All patients who are transferred to an intensive care unit should be accompanied by a doctor who can intubate if necessary. As an aside, chest radiographs are not indicated unless you suspect pneumothorax or consolidation, or there is life-threatening asthma, a failure to respond to treatment or a need for ventilation. "
respiratory system,213,"A tall rugby player was hit in the chest by a player of the opponent team. He developed breathlessness and his face went blue and purple. You have been called to look at him, how will you manage him?",Insert a needle in the 2nd ICS in the mid-clavicular line,Insert a needle in the 5th ICS in the mid-axillary line,Intubate the patient,Start CPR,Give oxygen,E,"1. The patient went blue and purple!! It is due to catch up of breath and it is not cyanosis of pneumothorax as cyanosis of pneumothorax takes time to develop and considered as a late feature. Immediate feature is chest pain, tachycardia, tachypnea etc"
respiratory system,214,Which of the following is true regarding a fat embolism?,Causes a rise in PaCO2,Hypertension,Is usually fatal,May be associated with a skin rash,Rise in PaO2,D,"Fat embolism is associated with major trauma, and it may manifest as increasing dyspnoea, hypotension and falling oxygen saturations. PO2 and PCO2 are also low. It is also associated with embolisation to the skin, and a typical petechial rash."
respiratory system,215,Which one of the following is correct regarding severe bullous emphysema?,Helium dilution is more accurate than body plethysmography in measuring residual volume.,Hypoxaemia at rest will improve with exercise.,Pulmonary compliance is reduced.,Reduced elastic recoil opposes airway collapse in expiration.,The carbon monoxide transfer factor is reduced.,E,"Whole body plethysmography also measures trapped gas, that is, intrathoracic gas (including within bullae and other poorly ventilated areas) which barely communicates with the airway. Standard gas dilution measures gas that communicates with the airway. Mixing in helium dilution is more difficult in airways obstruction requiring multibreath methods lasting five minutes rather than single breath test. Exertion will exacerbate breathlessness and hypoxia. The characteristic changes of severe emphysema are increase in static compliance and reduction in lung recoil pressure. Loss of lung recoil causes a reduction of alveolar pressure (elastic recoil pressure of lung + pleural pressure) leading to collapse of peripheral airways on expiration. Emphysematous patients purse their lips in expiration to increase airway pressure to prevent this collapse. CO transfer factor is reduced."
respiratory system,216,Which of the following is a typical feature of acute farmer's lung?,Basal crackles,Eosinophilia,Haemoptysis,Increased pCO2,Positive serum paraproteins,A,"Farmer's lung is the commonest occupational hypersensitivity pneumonitis, due to thermophillic actinomycetes. Crackles are typically heard at the bases. Other signs depend on the stage of disease. In the acute form, the symptoms usually start four hours after exposure to the sensitising antigen. There is malaise, fever, chest tightness, dry cough, and dyspnoea. Signs include tachypnoea and bibisal fine inspiratory crackles; wheeze is rare. Life-threatening respiratory failure can develop. In the subacute form, symptoms are less severe and include a productive cough, dyspnoea, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. There are often recurrent attacks, which may present as pneumonia. After the exposure is removed it can take weeks or months for the symptoms to resolve. In the chronic form there are minimal systemic symptoms, but marked limitation of exercise tolerance due to dyspnoea. If the source of the antigen is removed there is usually only partial improvement of symptoms. Cyanosis, clubbing, and apical inspiratory crackles may be present (due to an apical fibrosis). Eventually chronic hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension with right heart failure develop. There may be acute exacerbations. Eosinophilia can be seen but is not typical. Immunoglobulin levels are frequently elevated but not a paraprotein. PO2 may be decreased particularly with exercise. A restrictive pattern on LF studies is seen. "
respiratory system,217,A 24-year-old asthmatic female is admitted with acute severe asthma. Which of the following statements is correct?,A high inspired oxygen concentration should be used routinely,Agitation should be managed with a benzodiazepine,Inhaled salmeterol is indicated as first line therapy,Normal arterial pCO2 is reassuring,Pulsus paradoxus is a reliable sign of severity,A,"A normal or raised arterial pCO2 is an indication of severe asthma. Pulsus paradoxus is not reliable and is not part of the criteria in assessing severity of asthma attack. Salmeterol is used in management of chronic asthma (step 3). High dose oxygen (40-60%) should be used in severe asthma attack, together with steroids and nebulised bronchodilators. Sedation must be avoided as it can cause respiratory failure and arrest."
respiratory system,218,Which of the following is not true with regard to the radiological appearance of a chest x ray?,Consolidation of the left lower lobe will elevate the left hemidiaphragm,Consolidation of the lingular lobe will obliterate the aortic knuckle and pulmonary trunk in the PA view,Consolidation of the right middle lobe will extend to the right horizontal transverse fissure and the right heart border in PA view.,Collapse of the right upper lobe displaces the horizontal fissure in the PA view,The oblique fissures can only be seen on the lateral chest film,A,"Consolidation in the left lower lobe obliterates the diaphragm whilst lingular consolidation will obliterate the left heart border. Elevation of a hemidiaphragm is not typically caused by consolidation in adjacent lung. Consolidation of the right middle lobe obscures the right heart border (right atrial edge). More extensive consolidation also involves the right and left peri-hilar regions. The superior extent is well demarcated, due to the horizontal fissure. Right upper lobe collapse results in displacement of the horizontal fissure upwards. The right hilum can also appear enlarged. The oblique fissure runs obliquely at 45 degrees from T4-5 to the anterior costophrenic angle, but is only seen on the lateral chest radiograph. The horizontal fissure runs from the hilum anteriorly to anterior chest wall, on the right side. The area above the horizontal fissure is the upper lobe, below the horizontal fissure is the middle lobe and below the oblique fissure is the lower lobe. "
respiratory system,219,A 26-year-old patient with known Acuired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) presents with a history of increasing breathlessness and dry cough. He is investigated by the respiratory team and diagnosed with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Which of the following features is most accurate regarding PCP?,Amphotericin is the treatment of choice,Blood cultures are positive in 1/3rd of cases,Occurs only in AIDS,Pleural effusions are most often bilateral,The lungs are commonly clear on auscultation,E,"Patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia often present with signs and symptoms of respiratory distress, although on examination of the chest there is often no abnormality detected. Although initially reported as a disease associated with AIDS, PCP can affect any immunocompromised patient including transplant patients. The trophozoite does not enter the blood stream, and the organism is usually identified in pulmonary secretions. Co-trimoxazole (Septrin) or pentamidine are the treatments of choice."
respiratory system,220,A 50-year-old man has had hoarseness of voice and drooping eyelid for 2 months. a mass is palpable in the right supraclavicular fossa. He smokes 20 cigarettes/day for the last 30 years. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Carcinoma larynx,Carcinoma thyroid,Carcinoma right bronchus,Mesothelioma,Pancoast tumor,E,"Hoarseness of voice is due to compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, ptosis due to compression of the sympathetic ganglion, palpable mass in right supraclavicular fossa due to involvement of the supraclavicular lymph node.

respiratory system,221,"A 32 year old presents with a one week history of malaise, fever, headache, myalgia with a sore throat, dry cough and pleuritic chest pain. On examination there is bibasal crepitations. There is evidence of erythema nodosum and bloods reveal a haemolytic anaemia and cold agglutinins. What is the most likely causative agent?",Mycoplasma Pneumoniae,Coxiella Burnetti,Streptococcus Pneumoniae,H. Influenzae,Influenza B,A,The history of non specific flu like illness with dry cough should raise the suspicion of mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coxiella burnetti can present with a non specific illness however there is no history of exposure to farm yard animals. A clue also for the diagnosis is the evidence of haemolytic anaemia with cold agglutinins and erythema nodosum which can complicate mycoplasma pneumoniae. Extra pulmonary manifestations are common such as rashes. Neurological complications such as meningitis or cardiac such as myocarditis and pericarditis can also occur. Often the pneumonia is not the predominant feature. Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice.

"
respiratory system,228,A 24-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department and complains of shortness of breath. Before his chest x ray is taken he tells the casualty officer that he is known to have an 'azygous lobe'. In what region of the chest x ray would you expect to see an 'azygous lobe'?,Left lower zone,Left mid zone,Left upper zone,Right lower zone,Right upper zone,E,An azygous lobe is seen in about 0.5% of routine chest x rays and is a normal variant. It is seen as a 'reverse comma sign' behind the medial end of the right clavicle on the upper zone of the right lung. It appears separated from the rest of the upper lobe by a deep groove (which contains the azygous vein). In develops in utero when the apical bronchus grows medial to the arch of the azygous vein instead of lateral. It has little clinical significance.
respiratory system,229,A 45-year-old chronic smoker attends the OPD with complaints of persistent cough and copious amount of purulent sputum. He had history of measles in the past. Examination: finger clubbing and inspiratory crepitations on auscultation. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Interstitial lung disease,Bronchiectasis,Asthma,COPD,Sarcoidosis,B,"Persistent cough with copious purulent sputum and finger clubbing points towards the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. Severe lung infections such as tuberculosis (TB), whooping cough, pneumonia or measles can damage the airways at the time of infection. Bronchiectasis may then develop later on"
respiratory system,230,"A 41-year-old woman comes to the clinic with increasing shortness of breath. She has a history of systemic sclerosis, takes omeprazole for reflux symptoms and nifedipine slow release for Raynaud's disease. On examination her BP is 155/85 mmHg, pulse is 82 and regular. There is peripheral calcinosis on examination of the hands and pinching of the corners of the mouth consistent with scleroderma. Auscultation of the chest reveals scattered inspiratory crackles across both lung fields. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 122 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 8.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 199 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 62 mm/hr (less than10)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 131 µmol/L (79-118)    Chest x ray shows bilateral interstitial infiltrates. Echocardiogram shows ejection fraction 53%. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial pneumonia,Eosinophilic pneumonitis,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Interstitial fibrosis,Pulmonary oedema,D,"Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterised by increased fibroblast activity and fibrosis in a number of different organ systems. 90-95% of patients have positive antinuclear antibodies. There are two major subtypes:  limited cutaneous, and diffuse cutaneous.  CREST syndrome is an older term for the limited cutaneous form (calcinosis, Raynauds' phenomenon, oeosophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasia). Patients with systemic sclerosis can present with skin abnormalities, musculoskeletal changes, gastrointestinal complications, pulmonary disease, renal crisis and dry eyes and mouth. A number of autoantibodies against extractable nuclear antigens can be detected in patients with systemic sclerosis. Anti-centromere antibodies and anti-topoisomerase I antibodies are the classic autoantibodies associated with the disease. Anti-centromere antibodies are linked with limited cutaneous involvement and isolated pulmonary hypertension, and a good prognosis, whereas anti-topoisomerase I and linked with diffuse skin disease and pulmonary fibrosis and a higher mortality. Respiratory symptoms are common in patients with systemic sclerosis, but it is often difficult to distinguish between interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension as the cause. Echocardiography, pulmonary hypertension and chest radiographs or CT are often required. Inspiratory crackles heard here, coupled with bilateral interstitial infiltrates on chest radiograph, make interstitial lung disease the most likely diagnosis, but it is important to note they are not always present in the early stages of disease. The condition may be steroid responsive; as such a trial of prednisolone plus or minus an appropriate second line agent is indicated. Signs of pulmonary hypertension are jugular venous distension, right ventricular heave and an accentuated pulmonary second heart sound. Given the chronic nature of her disease bacterial infection is unlikely. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is by definition of unknown aetiology and this too therefore cannot be the correct answer. Given the normal ejection fraction pulmonary oedema is also unlikely. The absence of leukocytosis, and normal eosinophil count makes eosinophilic pneumonitis unlikely."
respiratory system,231,"A 39-year-old male smoker is reviewed in the respiratory clinic. He has worsening chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), with changes on his CXR consistent with emphysema, despite having reduced his number of cigarettes per day, and good compliance with his inhalers. A recent liver biopsy confirms presence of early cirrhosis. You suspect he may have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. He tells you that his parents have no chest or liver symptoms. Which of the following fits best with the likely mode of inheritance of his disease?",Autosomal codominant,Autosomal recessive,Compound heterozygote,De-novo mutation,Sex linked recessive,A,"The answer is autosomal codominant. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is caused by a mutation in the SERPINA-1 gene on chromosome 14 (14q32), and over 100 different allelic variants are known. The normal variant is the M allele, and the S and Z are common pathological alleles. As a result of all the different allelic variants, over 20 variants of the A1AT protein exist, and all are inherited as codominant alleles. Individuals have two copies of the A1AT gene. If they are homozygous for MM they have normal amounts of A1AT protein. SS, ZZ, MS, MZ, and SZ genotypes result in A1AT deficiency, but serum levels and therefore phenotype varies. Patients who are homozygous SS or ZZ are those who are most likely to manifest clinical disease. MS or MZ patients can be considered as carriers, with around 35% of the normal level of A1AT, but without clinically significant disease. None of the other patterns of inheritance above are classically associated with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. "
respiratory system,232,A 50-year-old male presented with acute respiratory failure during an episode of acute pancreatitis and was thought to have developed adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Which of the following would support a diagnosis of ARDS?,High protein pulmonary oedema,High pulmonary capillary wedge pressure,Hypercapnia ,Increased lung compliance ,Normal chest x ray,A,"Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) which describes a pulmonary syndrome characterised by non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema. It can be caused by a number of insults, the most common of which is systemic inflammation. This causes injury to the alveolar-capillary interface, with increase in the capillary permability and excudation of protein rich fluid into the interstitium and alveoli. In addition there is a deficiency in surfactant which reduces lung compliance and predisposes to collapse (especially in dependent zones). Chest radiographs, and CT, show heterogenous injury. Spirometry shows a reduced functional capacity, and the patient's work of breathing increases. ALI has a specific definition:  PaO2/FiO2 ratio of less than 300 Bilateral infiltrates on a chest radiograph Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of less than 18 mmHg  ARDS has the same definition except that the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is less than 200. There tends to be a type 1 respiratory failure, rather than type 2."

Which of the following is the next appropriate stage in management?",Salbuatmol Prn,Ipratropium,Maintenance dose oral steroids,Tiotropium,Nebulised salbutamol,D,Patients whose symptoms are not controlled on a long acting beta agonist and inhaled corticosteroid should have a long acting antimuscarinic antagonist added.
respiratory system,234,"A 28 year old gentleman has a long history of rhinitis and asthma. However he now presents with haemoptysis. He has also noticed a rash and severe pain which he states feels like sciatica. He is feeling generally unwell with fatigue, myalgia and weight loss. On examination he is hypertensive and there is a purpuric rash. Bloods reveal acute renal failure and elevated inflammatory markers and eosinophil count. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Malignancy,SLE,Wegeners Granulomatosis,Churg Strauss Syndrome,Polyarteritis Nodosa,D,"The most likely diagnosis is Churg Strauss syndrome. There is three phases. Often there is a history of allergic rhinitis and asthma followed by eosinophilic infiltrative disease with pneumonia or gastroenteritis and the vasculitis. The vasculitic disease can produces many symptoms in different organs such as mononeuritis multiplex, glomerulonephritis, GI symptoms such as pain or haemorrhage, cardiovascular involvement such as heart failure and skin changes such as purpura or livedo reticularis. Haemoptysis may occur due to infiltrative disease. Wegeners often presents with rhinorrhoea and sinusitis and not asthma and although can lead to mononeuritis multiplex does not usually lead to GI upset, hypertension or eosinophilia. Polyarteritis nodosa is not usually associated with rhinitis or asthma."

Which of the following is the most likely causative agent?",Cyclophosphamide,Methotrexate,Penicillamine,Prednisolone,Sulphasalazine,B,"Methotrexate is recognised to be associated with pulmonary fibrosis, it is however extremely effective in control of rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. Baseline pulmonary function tests are recommended prior to starting therapy, and physicians are warned to be alert to increased shortness of breath. Cyclophosphamide is rarely associated with non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, rather than pulmonary fibrosis. Penicillamine may rarely be associated with pulmonary haemorrhage. The main concern of sulphasalazine therapy is its association with blood dyscrasias."
respiratory system,241,"Regarding endotracheal tubes, which of the following is correct?",A right-facing bevel is usually at the distal end of the tube,Oxford tubes have a thin wall and are narrower for a given internal diameter,Plastic disposable tubes are frequently radio-opaque,The tube size refers to the external diameter which is marked on the outside of the tube in millimetres,Uncuffed RAE tubes have two Murphy eyes,E,"Endotracheal tubes can either be made of disposable plastic or red rubber which are reusable. The tube size refers to the internal diameter in mm not the external diameter. The internal diameter (ID) is marked on the outside of the tube (some manufacturers also have the external diameter marked on the outside). Plastic tubes have a radio-opaque line running along their entire length (rather than the entire tube being radio-opaque), which allows their position to be identified on x rays. The internal diameter of the tube is marked in millimetres on the outside (not the external diameter). The bevel located at the end of the tube is usually oval in shape and is left-facing (not right), which improves the view of the vocal cords during intubation. Oxford tubes are L-shaped and have a bevel that faces posteriorly. They have thick walls which increase the external diameter, making them wider for a given internal diameter (not narrower). RAE (Ring, Adair and Elwyn) tubes are preformed and can be either north or south facing, cuffed or uncuffed. The cuffed RAE tubes have one Murphy eye, whereas the uncuffed version has two eyes. Uncuffed tubes are mainly used in paediatric anaesthesia and two Murphy eyes ensure adequate ventilation should the tube be too long."

The other options all indicate a poor prognosis and the CURB 65 score is used to guide treatment because of this.
respiratory system,243,Which of the following is not a feature of ARDS?,Bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest xray,Protein rich fluid in alveolar space,No evidence of cardiac failure,Protein low fluid in alveolar space,Refractory hypoxia,D,"ARDS can be caused by numerous conditions including sepsis, pneumonia, smoke inhalation, trauma, acute pancreatitis, eclampsia and fat embolism. It leads to a non cardiogenic pulmonary oedema where there is leakage of protein rich fluid into the alveoli which leads to respiratory failure. There is an acute onset and there is bilateral diffuse infiltrates on chest xray. There should be no evidence of cardiac failure. The hypoxia is normally refractory and high levels of oxygen are required."

The cause of the hypoxia is most likely to be due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as a result of her heavy smoking history. Her history of increasing breathlessness, cough and sputum production and recurrent chest infections is consistent with this diagnosis. The treatment is for her to stop smoking and long term oxygen therapy (LTOT) (that is, oxygen for more than 15 hours/day), should the hypoxia be confirmed when fully recovered from this exacerbation. The indictations for LTOT are:  paO2 less than 7.3 kPa (55 mmHg), or paO2 less than 8.0 kPa (60 mmHg) with evidence of pulmonary hypertension, peripheral oedema or polycythaemia.  "

On examination he has a temperature of 38.2°C, his BP is 110/70 mmHg and his pulse is 95 and regular. There are widespread coarse crackles bilaterally on auscultation of his chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 139 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 12.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 222 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 µmol/L (79-118)    Chest x ray shows diffuse consolidation bilaterally. Which of the following is the most likely to treat the underlying cause of his symptoms?",Amphotericin B,Clarithromycin,Fluconazole,Penicillin,Prednisolone,E,"This patient most likely has 'Farmer's lung' which is a form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (extrinsic allergic alveolitis). Inhalational exposure to thermophilic Actinomyces species results in an immunologically mediated inflammation of the lung. Such species are associated with mouldy hay. Acute episodes are characterised by neutrophilic infiltration followed by lymphocytic infiltration and raised levels of interleukins 1 and 8 and TNF-alpha. This results in direct cellular damage and increased vascular permeability, which results in hypoxia and reduced lung compliance. Prolonged exposure leads to fibrosis and parenchymal destruction. Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis manifests as fever, chills, non-productive cough, chest tightness, dyspnoea, headache and malaise. Acute respiratory failure can develop if the exposure is large. At the other end of the spectrum, symptoms may settle within 12 hours of removal of the antigen. There is no specific diagnostic test, but leucocytosis with neutrophilia, elevated ESR and CRP and raised immunoglobulins are suggestive in the right clinical situation. Chest radiographs classically show diffuse air-space consolidation. Spirometry shows reduced forced vital capacity and total lung capacity. Primary treatment for acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis is avoidance of the antigen and systemic corticosteroids. Clarithromycin and penicillin would be considered treatments for bacterial pneumonia. This should definitely be considered as a diagnosis here, but the bilateral radiographic findings and clinical situations should lead you to conclude hypersensitivity pneumonitis is more likely. Although the aetiology is hypersensitivity to fungal spores, neither amphotericin B nor fluconazole are effective in the treatment of farmer's lung."

Signs include:  Pulsus alternans Raised jugular venous pressure Gallop rhythm, and Fine lung crackles.  Both arterial PO2 and PaCO2 fall in the early stages, but later the PaCO2 oincreases because of impaired gas exchange. The chest x ray may reveal:  Cardiomegaly Bilateral diffuse haziness owing to alveolar fluid Small effusion at cost-phrenic angles Fluid in the lung fissures, and Kerley B lines (linear opacities).  Collapse is a feature of atelectasis, whilst consolidation is a feature of pneumonia."

She has progressively worsening disease and is currently taking high dose Seretide and montelukast. Apparently she coughs every night, occasionally with frank haemoptysis and is finding it impossible to do any regular exercise at all. On examination her BP is 128/82 mmHg, pulse is 74 and regular. There is extensive wheeze and scattered coarse crackles on auscultation of the chest. Her peak flow is 320 (580 predicted). Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 127 g/L (115 - 160)   White cell count 7.9 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Eosinophil count 1.2 ×10^9/L (0.04 - 0.4)   Platelets 173 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135 - 146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5 - 5)   Creatinine 98 µmol/L (79 - 118)    Which of the following is the best investigation?",Aspergillus precipitins,CT thorax,CXR,IgE,Sputum culture,A,"The most likely diagnosis here is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA); as such aspergillus precipitins can contribute significantly to confirming the diagnosis. Oral steroids are the mainstay of initial treatment and anti-fungals such as itraconazole may also improve resolution of symptoms in some cases. Whilst both chest x ray and CT thorax may show evidence of infiltrates this is relatively non-specific and therefore would not be optimal investigations; they may, however, prove useful in assessing severity of disease. IgE is elevated in ABPA but is not as specific an investigation as aspergillus precipitins. Sputum culture may be positive but negative culture would not exclude the disease."
respiratory system,253,By which of the following is sleep apnoea syndrome best diagnosed?,Blood gases during apnoeic episodes,EEG,Polygraphic sleep studies,Presence of HLA-DR2 and DQw1,Therapeutic trial of amphetamines,C,Sleep apnoea is characterised by cessation of breathing during sleep. This causes extreme restlessness with frequent respiratory pauses during night sleep. Consequently patients report daytime drowsiness and irritability. It is associated with snoring. The diagnosis is established by polygraphic recording of sleep which shows periods (at least 30 of 10 or more seconds' duration in seven hours of sleep) of apnoea associated with a fall in arterial oxygen saturation. 
respiratory system,254,"A 25-year-old Afro-Caribbean patient presents to the GP with a progressive history of dyspnoea and a cough. She is initially treated for possible asthma but this fails to alleviate symptoms. The GP organises a CXR and spirometry. The CXR is reported as bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and upper lobe pulmonary infiltrates. On review in the chest clinic, spirometry shows a mild restrictive defect and serum angiotensive converting enzyme (SACE) is positive. She is diagnosed with pulmonary sarcoidosis. What is the stage (radiological) of her disease?",Stage 0,Stage I,Stage II,Stage III,Stage IV,C,"Chest x ray is abnormal in 85% of lung sarcoid, but 30-60% are asymptomatic (that is, incidental chest x ray finding).    Stage Finding Likehood of spontaneous resolution   0 Normal chest radiograph greater than90%   I Bilat hilar lymphadenopathy (BHL) 60-90%   II BHL plus pulmonary infiltrates 40-60%   III Pulmonary infiltrates (no BHL) 10-20%   IV Pulmonary fibrosis (+/- bullae) less than20%"
respiratory system,255,A 49-year-old man comes with history of cough and SOB. His CD4 count is measured as 350. CXR shows lobar consolidation. What is the single most appropriate option?,Mycobacterium avium intercellular,CMV,Streptococcus,Toxoplasmosis,Pneumocystis jerovici,C,Though CD4 count indicates immune deficiency syndrome features are consistent with lobar pneumonia
respiratory system,256,A 42-year-old woman presents to the clinic with a chronic cough. Which of the following features would increase the suspicion that she is suffering from asthma?,Associated dizziness,Chronic cough without wheeze,Symptoms corresponding with a coryzal illness,Symptoms in response to exercise,Voice disturbance,D,"The answer is symptoms in response to exercise. Guidelines from BTS/SIGN on the diagnosis and management of asthma suggest that the presence of wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness or cough, particularly if symptoms are worse at night or in the early morning, after exercise, allergy exposure or cold air, are suggestive of the diagnosis. A family history of atopy or asthma, personal history of atopy, widespread wheeze, low forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) also support the diagnosis. Dizziness, light-headedness, voice disturbance and chronic cough without wheeze do not support a diagnosis of asthma. In addition, there is no evidence that symptoms which correspond with a cold (coryzal illness) suggest an underlying diagnosis of asthma."
respiratory system,257,"A 60 year old male presents with shortness of breath on exertion and a productive cough. He has worked with granite and slate for many years. A CXR reveals multiple small nodules throughout the lungs and are predominant in the upper lobes. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is this patient at risk of developing?",Glomerulonephritis,Progressive massive fibrosis,Mesothelioma,Bronchial cancer,Cor pulmonale,B,The clue to the diagnosis is the exposure to granite and slate which contain crystalline silica such as Quartz. It can present like COPD. However some can present acutely after exposure to a large volume of dust and this is rapidly progressive and quickly fatal. In some cases there is evidence of multiple nodules but the patient is asymptomatic. A characteristic finding is calcification of the hilar lymph nodes  especially around the rim leading to eggshell calcification. Progressive massive fibrosis can then develop where  nodules coalesce and lead to large bilateral upper lobe masses sometimes with cavitation.
respiratory system,258,"A 32 year old presents with a one week history of malaise, fever, headache, myalgia with a sore throat, dry cough and pleuritic chest pain. On examination there is bibasal crepitations. There is evidence of erythema nodosum and bloods reveal a haemolytic anaemia and cold agglutinins. Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment should be commenced?",Amoxicillin,Ciprofloxacin,Erythromycin,Doxycycline,Co amoxiclav,C,The history of non specific flu like illness with dry cough should raise the suspicion of mycoplasma pneumoniae. Coxiella burnetti can present with a non specific illness however there is no history of exposure to farm yard animals. A clue also for the diagnosis is the evidence of haemolytic anaemia with cold agglutinins and erythema nodosum which can complicate mycoplasma pneumoniae. Extra pulmonary manifestations are common such as rashes. Neurological complications such as meningitis or cardiac such as myocarditis and pericarditis can also occur. Often the pneumonia is not the predominant feature. Erythromycin is the antibiotic of choice. Doxycycline can also be used but is not first line.
respiratory system,259,"A 68-year-old diabetic, and hypertensive with a 45 pack/year smoking history, has left sided chest pain increased with breathing. Examination: myosis on left side and wasting of small muscles of left hand. What is thesingle most appropriate diagnosis?",Costochondritis,Lung cancer,Good pasture’s syndrome,MND,Progressive massive fibrosis,B,"Smoking history, chest sign and Horner’s syndrome points towards lung cancer (probable pancoasttumour)"
respiratory system,260,"A 30-year-old man is referred to the chest clinic with an eight month history of progressive shortness of breath. He has smoked 20/day for 15 years. Investigations reveal a diagnosis of severe panacinar emphysema. On questioning he informs the consultant that his father died from COPD in his early 40s. Following a diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, he undergoes genetic testing. Given his history what is most likely to be his genotype?",PiMM,PiMS,PiSZ,PiZZ,PiSS,D,The genotype PiZZ is associated with the most severe form of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency as the circulating levels of A1AT are 10-15% of normal. The serum levels of some of the other common genotypes are:  PiMM: 100% (normal) PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT.  Cigarette smoking is especially harmful to those with A1AT deficiency and can accelerate the progression of emphysema by 10 years.
respiratory system,261,"A 71-year-old man presents with severe emphysema. He is on maximal therapy including high dose Seretide and tiotropium. He tells you that he is so unwell that he can barely manage the walk of 200 metres to the corner shop. On examination he looks short of breath at rest. His BP is 155/72 mmHg, pulse is 75 and regular. There are quiet breath sounds, occasional coarse crackles and wheeze on auscultation of the chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 141 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 8.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 292 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 136 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 123 µmol/L (79-118)   pH 7.42 (7.35-7.45)   pCO2 7.4 kPa (4.8-6.1)   pO2 9.8 kPa (10-13.3)   CXR Predominant upper lobe emphysema   FEV1 30% of predicted    Which of the features of his history, examination or investigations would preclude referral for lung reduction surgery?",FEV1 30% predicted,pCO2 7.4,pO2 9.8,Predominant upper lobe emphysema,Severe limitation of exercise capacity,B,"Lung volume reduction surgery is a palliative treatment which can be used in advanced COPD to remove the least functional part of the lungs. Techniques used include median sternotomy, video-assisted thoracoscopy and thoracotomy. Very mild hypoxia (pO2 is just below the lower limit of normal) need not necessarily preclude referral for lung reduction surgery, but CO2 retention does. The upper cut off for referral for lung reduction surgery for pCO2 is 7.3; as such he is unsuitable for referral. Severe limitation of exercise capacity despite maximal therapy is an indication for referral for lung reduction surgery. Other factors include predominant upper lobe emphysema, and persistent symptoms despite a period of pulmonary rehabilitation. In general the following selection criteria are used when assessing suitability for treatment:  Age less than75 years Emphysema by clinical evaluation Ex-smoker of more than 4 months Clinically stable on no more than 20mg prednisolone daily Significant functional limitation after 6-12 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation on optimal medical therapy Demonstrated compliance with medical regimen FEV-1 greater than20% predicted Post-bronchodilator FEV-1 greater than45% predicted and greater than15% if greater than70 years Hyperinflation demonstrated by TLC greater than100% predicted and RV greater than150% predicted Carbon monoxide lung transfer factor greater than 20% predicted Post rehabilitation 6 minute walk distance greater than140 m Low post rehabilitation exercise capacity HRCT demonstrating bilateral severe emphysema, ideally with upper-lobe predominance  "
respiratory system,262,Which of the following parameters represents the volume of air left in the lung after a maximal respiratory effort?,Expiratory reserve volume,Forced vital capacity,Inspiratory reserve volume,Residual volume,Tidal volume,D,The residual volume is that which is not cleared following expiration after maximal expiration (FVC) and amounts to around 1200 ml or 20% of the total lung capacity.
respiratory system,263,A 28 year old female presents with acute onset of shortness of breath and pleuritic chest pain. She has just recently flew back from Australia . She has no past medical history although she is on the contraceptive pill. On examination there is evidence of a swollen tender left calf. On auscultation of the chest it is clear however she is tachycardic. A CXR reveal nil focal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pneumothorax,Myocardial infarction,Deep vein thrombosis,Asthma,Pulmonary embolus,E,The history and clinical findings are highly suggestive of a pulmonary embolism. Asthma is unlikely as there is no wheeze and there is pleuritic chest pain. A pneumothorax would be evidenced on the Xray.
respiratory system,264,A 47-year-old patient has daytime sleepiness. He wakes up in the morning un-refreshed. He frequently dozes off while watching TV. He is hypertensive but well controlled with amlodipine 5 mg and ramipril 2.5 mg. He occasionally takes paracetamol for back pain. Neurological examination was normal. His BMI is 45. He was referred for suspicion of obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). Which of the following tests would you request to confirm diagnosis?,CT chest,Echocardiogram,Multiple sleep latency test,Polysomnography,Thyroid function tests,D,"It is important to be aware of the diagnostic tests for various respiratory problems. Polysomnography or sleep studies will reveal periods of apnoea during sleep. Hypothyroidism can be associated with OSA but thyroid function tests are not diagnostic of OSA. CT chest and echo are not helpful in making the diagnosis. Polysomnography will provide you with information regarding oxygen saturations and respiratory rate in addition to sleep quality, and can confirm or exclude the diagnosis of OSA. The multiple sleep latency test on the other hand only measures how quickly a person falls asleep in a quiet environment, and whilst it is a standard test for narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia, it doesn't provide the information required to make a diagnosis of OSA."
respiratory system,265,"A 28 year old farm worker presents with a dry cough and fever. For the last 2 weeks he has been suffering from a flu like illness with headache, myalgia and fatigue. Bloods reveal deranged LFTs and hyponatraemia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Streptococcus pneumonia,Chlamydia psittaci pneumonia,Q fever,Influenza,Viral pneumonia,C,This history is suggestive of Q fever which is caused by Coxiella Burnetti. Farmyard animals are often carriers of this bacteria. Often the pneumonia is not predominant and it presents like a flu like illness. A mild hepatitis often occurs. It can be complicated by neurological and cardiac complications such as aseptic meningitis or pericarditis/myocarditis. It can present in a chronic form. Doxycycline is useful for the management of the acute phase.
respiratory system,266,"In progessive massive fibrosis, what would you expect to see in pulmonary function testing?",Mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern,Restrictive pattern,Reduced gas transfer only,Obstructive pattern,No abnormalities,A,In PMF you would expect to find a mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern due to it causing airflow obstruction i.e. obstructive and interstitial lung disease and thus a restictive pattern.
respiratory system,267,A 37-year-old man presents with some raised lesions on the shin. He came with cough and also complains of arthralgia. Examination: bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum is present. What is the single most likely cause?,CD (crohn’s disease),UC (ulcerative colitis),Sarcoidosis,Streptococcal infection,TB,C,"Cough, arthralgia, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and erythema nodosum are suggestive of sarcoidosis"
respiratory system,268,A 28-year-old woman comes to see you with her partner. She has a brother who has been diagnosed with cystic fibrosis and her partner has tested positive as a carrier for the disease. They want to know about what the future holds if one of their children is born with cystic fibrosis. Which of the following is true?,Constipation is common in patients with CF,Diabetes only occurs in those patients who are overweight,Females with the disease are infertile,Median survival is expected to be around 27 years,Pancreatic enzyme supplements are only required if patients cannot maintain their weight,A,"Constipation even after the initial few days of life during which meconium ileus occurs is common in patients with cystic fibrosis. It usually responds to an increase in fluids coupled with adequate soluble fibre in the diet and pancreatic enzyme supplementation. Pancreatic endocrine, as well as exocrine, failure occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis. Diabetes mellitus occurs in greater than65% of patients by age 25 and this is independent of weight gain. Females with CF have a relatively minor reduction in their fertility, and many have now gone on to have successful pregnancies. Median survival has increased significantly over the past 10 years, and is now around 37 years. Pancreatic enzyme supplements are required to help patients maintain weight."
respiratory system,269,Which of the following is not true regarding alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency?,Liver is commonly involved,Protects from neutrophil elastase,PiZZ genotype produces severe disease,Alpha 1 antitrypsin is a glycoprotein,Most commonly recessively inherited,E,Alpha 1 antitrypsin is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant or co dominant and only as recessively rarely.
respiratory system,270,"A 30 year old male with asthma who has a regular steroid inhaler and uses salbutamol PRN, presents with worsening asthma. Despite his current management and good inhaler technique, he is having to use his salbutamol inhaler approximately four times a day. What is the next appropriate addition to his current medication?",Montelukast,Increased steroid dose,Sodium cromoglycate,Trial of addition of long acting beta agonist,Theophylline,D,The next step according to guidelines is the addition of long acting beta agonist. If the patient responds but this is still inadequate then steroid dose can be increased also. If there is no response then steroid dose can be increased and if this is inadequate on its own then other therapies such as montelukast or theophylline can be tried.
respiratory system,271,"A 61-year-old man presents with a four-day history of dry cough and increasing confusion. He has also suffered diarrhoea and headaches which have increased in severity over the past day. Past history of hypertension for which he takes perindopril and indapamide is noted as is recent travel to a medical convention in Spain. On examination his BP is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 92, he is pyrexial 38.2℃. There are coarse basal crackles bilaterally and signs of a left sided pleural effusion. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 137 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 11.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 173 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 133 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 132 µmol/L (79-118)   Alanine aminotransferase 180 U/L (5-40)   Alkaline phosphatase 220 U/L (39-117)    CXR - Patchy bilateral consolidation, left pleural effusion. Which of the following is the best treatment for him?",Benzylpenicillin,Doxycycline,Erythromycin,Levofloxacin,Rifampicin,D,"The history of recent travel to a convention, coupled with pneumonia with patchy consolidation, a pleural effusion, hyponatraemia, diarrhoea, and non-specific LFT changes raises the possibility of Legionnaire's disease. There is no definitive national or international consensus on the exact antibiotic choice in this situation, and in clinical practice, local guidelines should be followed. However, the antibiotic must have intracellular activity - in practice, this is usually with a fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin) or a newer macrolide (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin). Erythromycin has traditionally been used but has now been superseded by these newer agents.  Legionella is not sensitive to penicillin, therefore benzylpenicillin is an inappropriate choice in this case. Legionella resistance to rifampicin is noted, therefore this is not a first line option. A small recent study also noted increased liver function abnormalities in patients with Legionnaire's exposed to rifampicin. Tetracyclines can be used in patients who are allergic to fluoroquinolones and macrolides but are not usually first-line therapy."
respiratory system,272,"A 25-year-old man presented to the Emergency department with cough, shortness of breath and headache. He had been treated by his GP with amoxicillin but did not improve. He had recently been on holiday in Spain. On examination he had bilateral crackles. His liver enzymes were deranged. Which antibiotic should be used?",Co-amoxiclav,Clarithromycin,Intravenous cefuroxime,Metronidazole,Oseltamivir (Tamiflu),B,"This gentleman may have Legionella pneumophilia. Outbreaks are usually related to contaminated water cooling systems, showers, or air conditioning systems. The fact this gentleman has recently returned from Spain is supportive of the diagnosis, as is the presence of deranged liver function.  Legionella causes a flu-like disease, with a dry cough, reduced lymphocytes, hyponatraemia (due to SIADH), deranged LFTs and pyrexia. It can also result in diarrhoea, abdominal pain and creatinine kinase. Diagnosis should be made with urinary antigen testing, or serology. There is no definitive national or international consensus on the exact antibiotic used to treat Legionairre's disease, and in clinical practice local guidelines should be followed. However, the antibiotic must have intracellular activity - in practice this is usually with a fluoroquinolone (such as levofloxacin) or a newer macrolide (such as azithromycin or clarithromycin). Erythromycin has traditionally been used, but has now been superseded by these newer agents.  Mortality can be high especially in the immunocompromised, and therefore one should not wait for the results of culture or urinary antigens prior to starting treatment."
respiratory system,273,"A 40-year-old man is admitted to the Emergency department after being involved in a house fire. He is extremely drowsy but you notice on examining him that he seems well perfused, with his cheeks looking almost pink. His BP is 100/60 mmHg and his pulse is 95 and regular. Blood gas analysis reveals a CO level of 12% and a metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.15. Which of the following is the most appropriate next intervention?",100% oxygen by mask,Hyperbaric oxygen,IV mannitol,IV sodium bicarbonate,Nebulised salbutamol,A,"The answer is 100% oxygen by mask. Hyperbaric oxygen is recommended by some countries including the United States, although because of a lack of randomised control evidence it is not standard practice in the United Kingdom as there appears to be no significant improvement in outcome versus high flow oxygen alone. Sodium bicarbonate is not indicated, and IV mannitol is used only if there is suspicion of cerebral oedema. Key to prognosis is removal from the source of carbon monoxide as quickly as possible, and instigation of high flow oxygen treatment. At a level of 12%, long term psychological disturbance or memory loss is possible."
respiratory system,274,"A 35-year-old woman presents with a three month history of arthralgia, increasing fatigue and occasional nose bleeds. More recently she has become short of breath and has had two episodes of haemoptysis. On investigation she is found to have acute kidney injury, with a creatinine of 656 μmol/L and urine dipstix is positive for blood and protein. A chest x ray is performed which shows several nodules throughout both lung fields. The treating physician suspects Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Which of the below autoantibodies are most associated with this condition?",Anti-dsDNA,Anti-GBM,MPO-ANCA,p-ANCA,PR3-ANCA,E,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are diagnostic markers for vasculitis, although they may not be pathological. They are characterised by neutrophil staining; cytoplasmic staining uptake (c-ANCA) and peri-nuclear (p-ANCA). These are largely synonymous with PR3-ANCA (targeting peroxidise-3) and MPO-ANCA (targeting myeloperoxidase). PR3-ANCA has 60-90% sensitivity and more than 90% specificity for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Churg-Strauss and microscopic polyangiitis are more commonly associated with MPO-ANCA or p-ANCA, although may be positive for PR3 ANCA also. Goodpasture's is associated with anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody (anti-GBM). Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with anti-dsDNA antibodies."
respiratory system,275,"A 50-year-old Asian lady with severe rheumatoid arthritis has failed on most traditional DMARD treatments. She is currently on methotrexate 20 mg weekly and for the last six months has been receiving regular infusions of the anti-TNF-alpha monoclonal antibody, infliximab. Her joint disease has dramatically improved. She now presents with fevers, pleuritic chest pain and a large left sided pleural effusion, but little evidence of joint synovitis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Primary bronchial carcinoma,Pulmonary embolus,Pulmonary metastases,Rheumatoid related effusion,Tuberculosis,E,"The most likely answer is TB. All of the other answers are possible and need to be excluded. A rheumatoid effusion is unlikely when peripheral joint disease is so well controlled. Treatment with anti-TNF-alpha increases the risk of opportunistic infections and in particular, there is a significant increase in the risk of TB reactivation in conjunction with infliximab."
respiratory system,276,A 25-year-old chef undergoes a Mantoux test as a colleague has just tested positive for sputum positive tuberculosis. Which of the following response would indicate she has been infected with the disease?,3 mm,6 mm,9 mm,12 mm,18 mm,E,"The Mantoux test replaced the Heaf test in 2005 in the UK. One of its uses in for patients who have had close contact with a person known to have tuberculosis. The injection site should be reviewed 48-72 hours following intradermal inoculation of tuberculin. The left forearm is typically used. Only the induration, not surrounding erythema, is used in the measurement and the longest diameter is measured in millimetres:  Less than 6 mm: negative test, previously unvaccinated individuals can be given the BCG (within three months) provided there are no contraindications More than 6 mm but less than 15 mm: hypersensitive to tuberculin protein (may be due to previous TB infection, BCG, or atypical mycobacteria). Patients are not given the BCG if part of an immunisation programme. However, in other contexts (e.g. immigrant screening and contact tracing), further investigation should and follow-up may be indicated. More than 15 mm: strongly hypersensitive to tuberculin, suggestive of TB infection. Patients should be referred for further investigation and treatment  The reaction to tuberculin protein may be suppressed by viral infections, live viral vaccines, sarcoidosis, corticosteroids, immunosuppression, severe tuberculous disease and poor nutrition.

respiratory system,277,For LTOT the PaO2 must be less than?,6.5kPa,7.3 kPa,9 kPa,7.8 kPa,10kPa,B,Long term oxygen therapy is suitable for those with a PaO2 on air of <7.3 kPa
respiratory system,278,A 28 year old man and his partner present as they are having trouble conceiving. Further investigations reveal immobile sperm. The gentleman also gives a history of having chronic rhinorrhoea. He has also has a chronic cough and has had several episodes of sinusitis and pneumonia. A Chest X-ray reveals dextrocardia. A sweat test is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Kartagener's Syndrome,Allergic Rhinitis,Yellow nail syndrome,Cystic Fibrosis,Primary Ciliary Dykinesia,A,"This history is typical of Kartagener's syndrome. Kartagener's syndrome is when Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia is associated with situs inversus (as implicated here with the finding of dextrocardia) and abnormal sinuses. It is thought to be an autosomal recessive syndrome with defects in the structure and function of sensory and motile cilia. This results in infertility, bronchiectasis, rhinorrhoea and recurrent sinusitis and otitis media. For the diagnosis abnormalities in the cilia structure and function are required. Nasal nitric oxide measurement is a useful screening test as this will be low. Transmission electron microscopy of cilia from airway biopsy and CT chest for bronchiectasis are useful. Ciliary beat pattern analysis is thought to be most sensitive and specific. In cystic fibrosis lower respiratory problems are the most typical features and patients tend to present earlier. The sweat test would show a chloride concentration >60 mmol/L and a lower sodium concentration."
respiratory system,279,"A 22-year-old male is admitted wheezing with a respiratory rate of 35/min, a pulse of 120 beats per min, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, peak expiratory flow rate less than50% predicted. He has been given back-to-back nebulisers of salbutamol 5 mg and ipratroprium 0.5 mg for the last 45minutes and is on face mask oxygen. He has been given hydrocortisone 100 mg IV. The intensive care team are aware of the patient. His arterial blood gas (done on high-flow oxygen) reveals:    pH 7.42 (7.36-7.44)   PaCO2 5.0 kPa (4.7-6.0)   PaO2 22 kPa (11.3-12.6)   Base excess −2 mmol/L (+/-2)   SpO2 98    Which therapy should be implemented next?",Intubation and ventilation,Magnesium 1-2 g IV,Non-invasive ventilation,Oral aminophylline,Oral prednisolone,B,"This patient fits the criteria for life threatening asthma. A normal PaCO2 in an asthmatic is a warning of impending respiratory failure as the patient becomes too tired to ventilate adequately. Initial treatment has been given: β2-agonists should be administered as soon as possible, preferably nebulised driven by oxygen. Repeat doses should be given at 15-30 minute intervals, or continuous nebulisation can be used where there is inadequate response to bolus therapy. Nebulised ipratropium bromide should be added for patients with acute severe or life threatening asthma, or those with a poor initial response. Its addition produces significantly greater bronchodilation than a β2-agonist alone. Oxygen should be given to maintain saturations at 94-98%. Patients with saturations less than 92% on air should have an ABG to exclude hypercapnia. However, starting treatment should not be delayed to do the ABG. Initially high-flow oxygen is used, and then weaned to maintain adequate saturations. Unless you suspect COPD there is no need to be cautious with oxygen therapy. This gentleman is receiving adequate ipratropium and oxygen, and repeating/increasing these are unlikely to help the situation markedly. Failure to respond to the above treatment steps warrants the use of intravenous magnesium sulphate (or aminophylline, but this is not an option here). Magnesium has been shown to result in bronchial smooth muscle relaxation. Before intubation and ventilation it is appropriate to trial magnesium sulphate first. Intensive care is indicated for patients with severe acute or life threatening asthma who are failing to respond to therapy. Consider it in patients with:  Deteriorating peak flow Persisting or worsening hypoxia Hypercapnia Acidosis Exhaustion, or Altered conscious state.  All patients who are transferred to an intensive care unit should be accompanied by a doctor who can intubate if necessary. This would be considered if this gentleman fails to respond to magnesium, and in a clinical setting you would want to discuss him with your ITU colleagues whilst the magnesium was being given. Chest radiographs are not indicated unless you suspect pneumothorax or consolidation, or there is life threatening asthma, a failure to respond to treatment or a need for ventilation. As an additional point, steroids reduce mortality, relapses, subsequent hospital admission and requirement for β2-agonists^1. The earlier they are given in the attack, the better the outcome. A dose of 40-50 mg prednisolone (or IV equivalent) should therefore be given once oxygen and nebuliser therapy has been established. This should be continued for five days, or until recovery, and can then be stopped abruptly unless the patient has taken long term oral corticosteroids. "
respiratory system,280,"A 48 year old female presents with dyspnoea and syncope on exertion. She is a non smoker and has no past medical history. On examination she has a raised JVP, right parasternal heave, loud pulmonary second heart sound and peripheral oedema. Her chest is clear. An ECG reveals right ventricular strain pattern and CXR shows prominent pulmonary arteries. She now admits to having used fenfluramine in the past. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Multiple recurrent pulmonary embolus,COPD,Asthma,Aortic stenosis,Primary pulmonary hypertension,E,"This history is suggestive of pulmonary hypertension. The clue to this not being secondary to thromboembolic disease is the history of the use of fenfluramine as this has been associated with the development of pulmonary hypertension. Hereditary haemorrhage telangiectasia, CREST syndrome and HIV have been associated with its development. In a minority it is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and in some a mutation of the bone morphogenic protein receptor is found. Options for management include anticoagulation, calcium channel blockers, prostacyclin analogues, , endothelin A receptor antagonists and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors."
respiratory system,281,Which of the following organisms is associated with a cavitating upper lobe pneumonia?,Strep. Pneumoniae,Pneumocystis jiroveci,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Staphylococcus Aureus,D,Klebsiella pneumonia often involves the upper lobes and leads to cavitating lesions. Pneumocystis jiroveci leads to diffuse perihilar bilateral infiltrates. Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia typically leads to multilobar involvement.
respiratory system,282,Which of the following leads to low pleural effusion glucose levels?,Parapneumonic,Rheumatoid disease,Cirrhosis,Congestive cardiac failure,Hypothyroidism,B,"From the options, rheumatoid disease is the only cause of low glucose levels in pleural effusion."
respiratory system,283,Which of the following does not interact with theophylline levels?,Amoxicillin,Smoking,Carbamazepine,Clarithromycin,Alcohol,A,"Cessation of smoking, alcohol and clarithromycin can lead to an increase in theophylline levels whilst carbamazepine reduces the levels. Amoxicillin does not interact."
respiratory system,284,"A 31-year-old woman is brought to the Emergency department by ambulance. She has just got off a long-haul flight and collapsed at the baggage carousel. On examination in the department she is hypotensive with a BP of 80/50 mmHg, her pulse is 95 and regular. Her chest is clear and her abdomen is soft and non-tender. You notice that her left leg appears swollen. Investigations show:    pH 7.38 (7.35-7.45)   pO2 9 kPa (on non-rebreather) (10-13.3)   pCO2 3.6 kPa (4.8-6.1)    ECG shows right heart strain Which of the following would be an indication for thrombolysis in this patient?",BP 80/50,ECG showing right heart strain,pCO2 3.6,pH 7.38,pO2 9,A,"Hypotension and cardiogenic shock are the most significant factors associated with increased mortality in massive pulmonary embolus (PE). As such it is the BP here which drives progression to thrombolysis rather than anti-coagulation. The pH is in the normal range, as such it would not be a driver of more aggressive intervention here. All of the other factors are indications of a large PE, but without hypotension they would not necessarily drive thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy. This is because the evidence for thrombolysis in sub-massive PE is much less strong than that for a massive event. "
respiratory system,285,"A 54-year-old woman is referred to the chest clinic by the GP with a history of a non-productive cough. She is severely troubled by her symptoms often waking at night. She is a smoker with a 25-pack year history. According to the current British Thoracic Society guidelines, at least how long must symptoms be present to be defined as a chronic cough and investigated as such?",3 weeks,4 weeks,8 weeks,3 months,4 months,C,"Debate exists as to what constitutes a cough event and what period of symptoms is needed to define a chronic cough. However guidelines have been produced and knowledge of these is required for effective management of patients. In epidemiological studies 16% of the United Kingdom population reported a persistent cough. For the purposes of the BTS guidelines, cough is a forced expulsive manoeuvre against a closed glottis with a characteristic sound. Acute cough is defined as one lasting less than three weeks. A chronic cough is defined as one lasting over eight weeks. There is a grey area between three to eight weeks and this includes post-viral coughs. There are several serious conditions that may present with an isolated cough including neoplasm, infection (for example, TB), and interstitial lung disease. In those with a normal chest x ray, reflux disease, asthma syndromes and rhinitis should be considered. "
respiratory system,286,"A 75-year-old woman with a productive cough was admitted by her GP. She has a temperature of 38.2°C. She is not oriented to time or place. On examination she right basal crackles. Her BP is 110/60 mmHg and respiratory rate is 34/min. Pulse is 105 and regular. O2 saturation is 92%. Chest x ray shows right basal consolidation. The patient was given IV antibiotics for the first three days, improved and she was switched to oral antibiotics. Investigations on admission showed:    White cell count 15 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   CRP 75 mg/L (less than10)   Na 140 mmol/L (137 - 144)   K 3.8 mmol/L (3.5 - 4.9)   Urea 9.4 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.5)   Serum creatinine 100 μmol/L (60 - 110)    A 7 day course of antibiotics has been completed, and the patient's symptoms have resolved. What is the best plan of action on discharge?","Check full blood count, U/E and CRP in four weeks",Chest x ray in six weeks,CT chest,Discharge with a prescription of oral antibiotics for five to seven days,Refer to a respiratory physician,B,It is important for patients who had pneumonia and had a consolidation on chest x ray to have a follow up chest x ray to ensure complete resolution. This is to exclude any underlying cause especially malignancy. Not all patients need referral to a respiratory physician; only those who have persistent shadowing on the lung. bloods will likley of normalised by this time.  CT chest should be sought in people with CXR changes. Antibiotics may be needed but this is not always needed.  A respiratory physician will not be needed in the case of a simple CAP.
respiratory system,287,"A 70-year-old man with lung cancer presents with a cough. He is already on codeine, steroid and salbutamol inhalers. What is the single most appropriate management?",Nebulized adrenaline,0.9% saline nebulized,Oral morphine,Antibiotics,Benzodiazepines,B,Nebulized NS loosens the phlem and help to expectorate it easily

Which one of the following percentages is the correct risk?",0%,25%,50%,75%,100%,C,As both parents are carriers of the CF gene then the chance of another child being affected (homozygote) is 1 in 4 (25%). The chance of their child being free from the CF gene is also 1 in 4 (25%) and the chance of a child being a carrier (heterozygote) is 1 in 2 (50%).
respiratory system,289,A 67-year-old retired plumber presents to the clinic with increasing shortness of breath and dull left sided chest pain. You understand that this has been a problem for some six months or more. There is no past medical history of note apart from essential hypertension for which he takes ramipril 10 mg / day. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 136 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 9.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 252 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 119 µmol/L (79-118)   pH 7.41 (7.35-7.45)   pCO2 6.2 kPa (4.8-6.1)   pO2 9.6 kPa (10-13.3)   CXR Large left pleural effusion    Which of the following is the optimal investigation to deliver the diagnosis?,Blind pleural biopsy,CT thorax,Sputum cytology,Thoracocentesis,Thoracoscopy with drainage and biopsy,E,"This man is most likely to have mesothelioma. Tissue can be obtained from thoracoscopy with biopsy from abnormal looking areas, as such this is the most appropriate investigation to deliver the diagnosis. Blind pleural biopsy may result in tissue being obtained from an area not affected by mesothelioma. As such this is not correct. Whilst thoracocentesis is likely to obtain malignant cells, the histopathologist may not be able to type them adequately. CT scanning may reveal structural abnormalities but will not give a histological diagnosis and sputum cytology would be unlikely to reveal malignant cells."
respiratory system,290,A 67-year-old man who has a long history of chronic bronchitis is admitted from home with an acute exacerbation. Investigations show:    pCO2 11 kPa (4.7-6)   pO2 6.7 kPa (10-13.3)    Which of the following would be expected in this patient?,A metabolic acidosis with a low bicarbonate would be expected,Extensor plantar responses or myoclonic jerks may be expected,Gentamicin would be a reasonable initial treatment until cultures are available,Oxygen therapy should aim to increase the pO2 to above 8 kPa (60 mmHg),Peripheral oedema indicates coexisting heart failure,B,"Together with emphysema, chronic bronchitis is part of the spectrum of respiratory disease described as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Chronic bronchitis itself is defined as chronic cough and sputum production for at least three months of two consecutive years in the absence of other disease which could explain these symptoms. The ABG here demonstrates type 2 respiratory failure. The patient is likely to be acidotic, due to the raised pCO2'  that is, a respiratory acidosis. The bicarbonate is likely to be normal, or raised if the patient has chronic hypercapnia. The signs and symptoms of respiratory acidosis are:    Central nervous system Respiratory system Cardiovascular system   Cerebral vasodilation Breathlessness Flushing, bounding pulse   Increased intracranial pressure Cyanosis Cor pulmonale   Headache, confusion, agitation Pulmonary hypertension Systemic hypotension   Hallucinations, transient pyschosis   Arrhythmias    Myolonic jerks, flapping tremor, extensor plantars, depressed reflexes   Initially good cardiac output, then decreases   Papilloedema, constricted pupils       Seizures, coma        BTS guidelines would recommend treatment of exacerbations with amoxicillin, co-amoxiclav or cephalosporin (depending on local sensitivities). Gentamicin is not usually indicated. Oxygen should be given to maintain SaO2 within the patient's individual target range, if available (COPD patients are being given cards with this information, so always ask). If the individual target is not known, saturations should be maintained at 88-92%. ABGs should be repeated at regular intervals to monitor response to treatment, and oxygen weaned when possible. The ABG is used to see the pH and pCO2, and it is these values that guide treatment rather than the pO2 alone. Peripheral oedema may be present as a dependent oedema, as patients with COPD may have limited mobility due to dyspnoea, and therefore does not necessarily indicate heart failure."
respiratory system,291,"A 55-year-old plumber presented with a dry nocturnal cough and increasing exertional breathlessness. On examination he had early finger clubbing, cyanosis and bilateral basal crackles. A chest x ray showed bilateral lower zone shadowing. Investigations revealed:    PaO2 (breathing air) 8.2 kPa (11.3-12.6)   FEV1/FVC ratio 85% -    Which of the following investigations is most likely to establish the diagnosis?",Echocardiography,High resolution CT scan of chest ,Measurement of diffusion capacity ,Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level ,Transbronchial lung biopsy ,B,"This patient has a restrictive lung defect and hypoxia, with clinical features of lung fibrosis. With the occupational history there might have been previous asbestos exposure although the CXR is not reported to show pleural thickening or plaques. The next test should be one to confirm pulmonary fibrosis. High resolution CT chest is often diagnostic with good correlation to histological abnormalities. A ground-glass appearance is associated with alveolar inflammation and predominantly cellular appearance on biopsy. This form of IPF is associated with better rsponse to treatment and has a better prognosis. A reticular pattern is suggestive of destroyed fibrotic lungs.    "
respiratory system,292,A 67-year-old patient with a history of COPD is being assessed by the community COPD team for his suitability for treatment at home (under the Hospital at Home scheme) for his latest exacerbation. Which of the following is a contraindication to Hospital at Home (HaH) treatment?,Acute changes on a chest x ray,Dementia,Increasing age,Long term oxygen therapy (LTOT),Longer duration of COPD,A,"A specific subtype of intermediate care is Hospital at Home (HaH), where active treatment is provided by healthcare professionals in the patient's home for a condition that otherwise would require hospital care. BTS has issued recommendations as to whom HaH should be offered. It recommends that HaH should not be offered in the below instances:  Impaired level of consciousness Acute confusion pH less than7.35, if arterial blood gases have been measured Acute changes on chest radiograph Concomitant medical problem requiring inpatient stay Insufficient social support, no telephone, residence geographically removed from hospital New hypoxaemia (SpO2 90%) - a contraindication if oxygen cannot be provided at home.  Although factors such as increasing age and duration of COPD have been shown in studies to identify those at increased risk of relapse, they have only a moderate sensitivity and specificity, and hence are not included in the listed contraindications. "
respiratory system,293,A 16-year-old male presents to his GP with exertional breathlessness. The chest x ray reveals a lesion in the anterior mediastinum. Which one of the following is the most likely cause for such an appearance?,Ascending aorta,Hilar lymph nodes,Left atrium,Oesophagus,Thymus gland,E,"Abnormalities of the anterior/superior mediastinum may relate to the thymus, thyroid. Inferior or middle mediastinal masses relate to the aorta, lungs, hilar lymph nodes, oesophagus and heart. Posterior mediastinal masses may relate to the nerves and vertebrae."
respiratory system,294,Which of the following has been proven to improve survival in COPD?,Salbutamol nebulisers,Nil,Steroids,Salbutamol in haler,Long term oxygen therapy,E,LTOT is the only treatment which has been proven to improve survival as well as provide symptom control. It is thought to work by improvement of pulmonary vasculature haemodynamics.
respiratory system,295,"A 20-year-old male student is assessed for shortness of breath that occurs whilst running. He has no other symptoms and does not smoke. Examination, full blood count, and chest x ray are normal. Which of the following is most likely to be helpful in confirming the suspected diagnosis?",Arterial blood gas studies before and after exercise ,Determination of lung volumes and diffusing capacity,Measurement of venous blood lactate before and after exercise,Spirometry before and after administration of bronchodilators,Spirometry before and after exercise ,E,"The most likely diagnosis is exercise-induced asthma and this would be best diagnosed with spirometry before and after exercise, where a typical obstructive pattern may be displayed following exercise. No abnormalities may be displayed following bronchodilator therapy if it is true exercise-induced asthma. Similarly lung volumes and diffusion capacity are likely to be unaffected. Blood gas analysis would be relatively unhelpful in this scenario as little change in partial pressures would be expected. This patient does not have a glycogen storage disease where weakness rather then shortness of breath is more typical, hence lactate measurements are unnecessary."
respiratory system,296,"A 37 year old presents with fatigue, weight loss and nausea.  He describes episodes of haemoptysis and has noticed his urine being very dark.  On examination he has bibasal crepitations.  His bloods reveal an iron deficiency anaemia and renal impairment and urinalysis reveals proteinuria and microscopic haematuria.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Glomerulonephritis,Goodpastures syndrome,Wegeners Granulomatosis,Churg Strauss syndrome,SLE,B,This patient presents with Goodpastures disease which is the combination of glomerulonephritis and pulmonary alveolar haemorrhage.  It is an autoimmune disease and there is antibodies to anti glomerular basement membrane which are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease.  People present as above and there can be significant hypoxia and also massive pulmonary haemorrhage complicating the disease.  ANCA is also raised but is not specific to Goodpastures syndrome.  PANCA is seen in Wegeners granulomatosis.  Wegeners leads to upper respiratory features and Churg Strauss leads to asthma also.
respiratory system,297,"A 47-year-old man with confusion is brought into the emergency department via ambulance. He has a history of alcohol abuse and is currently living in a homeless shelter. On questioning he reports feeling generally unwell for several months with malaise and weight loss. He has recently complained of a headache to workers at the house, and has been acting strangely over the last few days. He was treated for tuberculosis (TB) two years ago, but was non-compliant with medication. He is investigated and diagnosed with cerebral tuberculosis. He is commenced on rifampicin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and isoniazid. He is also started on steroid therapy. For how long should treatment be continued in total?",2 months,4 months,6 months,8 months,12 months,E,"Worldwide TB affects 10 million people and causes two million deaths. In developed countries it is relatively uncommon. Those who are elderly, malnourished or immunocompromised (HIV, diabetes, alcoholism, corticosteroid therapy) are susceptible. Uncomplicated pulmonary TB is treated for a total of six months, with a three or four drug regime continued for two months followed by using rifampicin and isoniazid for the remaining four months. In meningeal or cerebral TB, a four drug regime is continued for 12 months (use of steroids is also recommended) to ensure adequate brain penetration and to prevent cranial nerve compression by meningeal scarring. Current NICE guidelines on Tuberculosis (NG33) recommend a treatment regimen of isoniazid, pyrazinamide, rifampicin and a fourth drug (for example, ethambutol) for the first 2 months, followed by isoniazid and rifampicin 10 months. In addition a glucocorticoid (equivalent to prednisolone 20-40 mg) is recommended for the first 2-3 weeks, then with gradual reduction."
respiratory system,298,Which of the following recognised associations is correct?,Bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and wheezing,Lung carcinoids and pleural effusion,Pneumoconiosis and clubbing,Pulmonary embolus and left bundle branch block,Pulmonary fibrosis and hypercapnia,A,"Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, which can present with asthma and eosinophilia. Pulmonary fibrosis is associated with type 1 respiratory failure, which is associated with ventilation/perfusion mismatch. In general, clubbing is only seen in advanced pneumoconiosis. Remember in the MRCP they are 'single best answer' questions - i.e. more than one answer may be correct but you need to choose the most correct answer. There is a stronger associated between bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and wheeze than there is between pneumoconiosis and clubbing and therefore this is the most correct answer. Pulmonary embolus is associated with right bundle branch block. There is not a strong associated between bronchial carcinoid and pleural effusion."
respiratory system,299,"A 26-year-old man presents with gradual onset of cough and shortness of breath on exertion. He has no medical history of note. He is single and smokes 20 cigarettes a day. He reports in the last year he has had a number of infections, and last month was diagnosed with oesophageal candidiasis on endoscopy. His oxygen saturations are 93% on air at rest, but drop to 82% on minimal exertion. Chest examination is unremarkable. A chest x ray is requested. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,COPD,Lung abscess,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP),Pulmonary embolism,D,"The history of recurrent infections in this young patient should lead you to consider immunosuppression as an underlying diagnosis and therefore Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a eukaryotic microorganism. In immunosuppressed patients it can cause a pneumonia, which is most recognised in patients with AIDS but can also be seen in those with organ transplants or when undergoing chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 is associated with significant risk. In Europe, the USA and Australia P. jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients is seen largely in those unaware of their HIV status. Unfortunately it is a major cause of death in Africa, especially in children. Previously it was thought that disease was caused by reactivation of latent infection acquired in childhood, but de novo infection is increasingly recognised. The pneumonia caused by P. jiroveci is potentially severe and fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Clinically it presents with several weeks' history of dry cough, fever and dyspnoea. Examination findings are often subtle, but include tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and fine respiratory crackles. Typically, patients desaturate markedly on exertion. There may be reduced transfer factor, vital capacity and total lung capacity on spirometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum can be used to demonstrate the organism (open lung biopsy is gold standard, but rarely performed in clinical practice). Giemsa, Papanicolaou and Grocott's stains are used. There are a variety of different chest radiograph findings. Typically it causes bilateral symmetrical perihilar reticular or granular interstitial shadowing. Less often there can be asymmetric shadowing, or progression to a reticular-alveolar pattern. The following can occasionally be seen:  lobar consolidation nodular lesions prominent pulmonary arteries pneumothorax pneumomediastinum cysts, or pneumatoceles.  In patients who have been on prophylactic inhaled pentamidine the infiltrates may predominantly affect the upper lobes. A normal chest x-ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not typical, but be aware of the possibility of multiple disease processes in an immunosuppressed patient. If allowed to progress, P. jiroveci can disseminate via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes to affect the thyroid, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. If PCP is suspected, treatment with full dose co-trimoxazole should be started as soon as possible. It should be given for 21 days in HIV-positive cases, but shorter doses can be used in other causes of immunosuppression. In patients who are intolerant or co-trimoxazole, intravenous pentamidine can be used. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids can reduce the risk of respiratory failure, and they are therefore used in some cases. Prophylaxis should be used in immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of developing PCP: all those with a CD4 count of less than200, patients started on high dose steroids, and those on chemotherapeutic regimens associated with significant immunosuppression. Co-trimoxazole is also the first line prophylactic agent. It would be unusual for someone this young to develop COPD, even if they are a heavy smoker. Asthma would have classical signs on examination if severe enough to cause hypoxia. If the patient had a lung abscess you would expect some systemic features of sepsis. A pulmonary embolism could account for these clinical signs, but there are no risk factors given in the question which makes PCP more likely."
respiratory system,300,A patient was diagnosed with TB and had been on treatment for two months. He was lost to follow up. Four months later he presented with haemoptysis and fatigue. On examination his temperature was 38.2°C. Sputum analysis for acid fast bacilli was positive. The patient is suspected of having multiple drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB). Which of the following would be the strongest risk factor for MDR TB?,Age 12-20 years,Female gender,Herpes simplex virus,HIV or other opportunistic infeciton,Rural area,D,"The risk factors for MDR TB are:  History of prior TB drug treatment; prior TB treatment failure Contact with a known case of drug-resistant TB Birth in a foreign country, particularly high-incidence countries HIV infection Residence in London  Age profile, with highest rates between ages 25 and 44, and Male gender.

respiratory system,301,A 65 year old male with COPD presents with an acute exacerbation. He is commenced on salbutamol and ipratropium nebulisers and given IV hydrocortisone. However blood gases reveal a pO2 of 8.0 kPa and a pCO2 of 10.0 kPa and a pH of 7.2. What is the next appropriate step in management?,Intubation for ventilation,CPAP,BiPAP,IV doxapram,Reduce oxygen therapy,C,The next appropriate step would be non invasive ventilation with BiPAP being utilised due to the high CO2 and respiratory acidosis to aim to blow off CO2. If the patient had not been hypoxic or acidotic then reducing O2 and repeat gases may have been appropriate. CPAP is not appropriate due to the elevated PCO2. IV doxapram is only considered if NIV is not appropriate.
respiratory system,302,"A 67-year-old male smoker with a 35 pack/year history is referred to the rapid access lung cancer clinic by the GP following a suspicious chest x ray. He undergoes a CT scan of his thorax. The report is as follows: 'There is a 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe which is involving the right main bronchus. There are several ipsilateral hilar lymph nodes, the largest measuring 2.3 cm. There is no evidence of distant metastases. The overall appearance is in keeping with a lung carcinoma, most likely non-small cell'. Based on the TNM (tumour, nodes, and metastases) classification, what is the radiological staging of this patient's lung cancer?",T2N1M0,T2N2M0,T2N3M0,T3N1M0,T3N2M0,A,This patient has a T2N1M0 lung cancer. TMN staging is used by the multidisciplinary team to aid the choice of treatment. T2 = Tumour with any of the following features of size or extent:  Greater than 3 cm in greatest dimension Involves main bronchus Greater than 2 cm distal to the carina Invades the visceral pleura. Associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis that extends to the hilar region but does not involve the entire lung.

respiratory system,303,"A 39-year-old gentleman is referred to the chest clinic with an eight month history of progressive shortness of breath. He has smoked 20/day for 20 years. Investigations reveal a diagnosis of moderate emphysema. On questioning he informs the consultant that his father died from COPD in his early 50s. Following a diagnosis of alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, he undergoes genetic testing and is found to have the PiSZ genotype. What levels of alpha1 antitrypsin would be expected if they were to be measured?",10% of normal,20% of normal,40% of normal,60% of normal,80% of normal,C,The serum levels of some of the common genotypes are:  PiMM: 100% (normal) PiMS: 80% of normal serum level of A1AT PiSS: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT PiMZ: 60% of normal serum level of A1AT PiSZ: 40% of normal serum level of A1AT PiZZ: 10-15% (severe alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency).  Cigarette smoking is especially harmful to those with A1AT deficiency and can accelerate the progression of emphysema by 10 years.
respiratory system,304,A 24 year old presents with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. A CXR reveals an air rim of greater than 2cm and sats are 99%. How should this patient me managed initially?,High flow oxygen,Discharge with outpatient follow up,Chest drain,Admit for observation,Aspiration,E,This patient is young with no PMH therefore it is likely to be primary. However she is breathless and the pneumothorax is greater than 2cm thus in the first instance aspiration should be attempted.

Her pulse oximetry shows oxygen saturation of 90% cxr is clear. Arterial blood gas analysis performed on air shows    pH 7.3 (7.36-7.44)   PO2 7.8 kPa (11.3-12.6)   PCO2 7.5 kPa (4.7-6.0)   Bicarbonate 30 mmol/L (20-28)    What is the most likely cause?,Bronchial asthma,Left ventricular failure,Lobar pneumonia,Neuromuscular weakness,Pulmonary embolism,D,"This patient has type 2 respiratory failure as evidence by hypoxia PaO2 of less than8.0 kPa and hypercapnia PaCO2 greater than6.0 kPa. This occurs when alveolar ventilation is insufficient to excrete the amount of CO2 produced by metabolism. This is due to one or a combination of the following factors:  Reduced ventilatory effort Failure to overcome increased resistance to ventilation, and Failure to compensate for an increase in CO2 production.  The commonest cause is chronic obstructive airway disease, other causes include respiratory muscle weakness, for example, Guillain-Barré syndrome, chest wall deformity, respiratory centre weakness. The other causes listed here produce type 1 respiratory failure with a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion."

This is the second commonest cause of bacterial meningitis (commonest in the elderly) and is associated with the highest mortality (20%) and highest morbidity, such as deafness which may occur in 50%. Contacts do not require treatment and there is no rash associated with pneumococcal meningitis. Meningococcus is Gram negative."
respiratory system,307,A 16-year-old girl presents with shortness of breath and insomnia prior to an examination. Clinical examination is normal. CXR and PEFR are normal. Which of the following investigations is most suggestive of asthma?,Diurnal variation in PEFR greater than20%,Increased total IgE,Past medical history of hay fever and eczema,Positive skin prick test to common allergens,Resolution of symptoms the day after the examination,A,"Shortness of breath in a young person may be attributable to asthma. These symptoms are often worse at night, and can cause disturbed sleep.  IgE being elevated is non-specific, but can suggest an atopic phenotype. Skin prick tests can confirm allergy, but this does not necessarily mean the patient will develop asthma.  The resolution of symptoms after the examination may suggest anxiety, but be cautious of making this diagnosis prior to excluding other diagnoses (especially in a patient this young). Diurnal variation of peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) greater than 20% is one of the diagnostic criteria for asthma, and this is the most appropriate answer in this case."
respiratory system,308,"In some cases of familial primary pulmonary hypertension, mutation of bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 on chromosome 2q33 is thought to be responsible. What does this gene encode?",TGF beta,Fibrillin,Interleukin 10,Interleukin 6,TNF alpha,A,Bone morphogenic protein receptor 2 on chromosome 2q33 encodes for TGF beta which acts as a growth suppressor and decreased cellular proliferation.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Influenzae B,Influenzae A,Extrinsic allergic alveolitis,Metal Fume Fever,Common Cold,D,The most likely diagnosis is metal fume fever. This is an illness which can occur in welders where zinc oxide fumes are released and leads to flu like symptoms which occur few hours after exposure and can last for 6 to 24 hours. High levels of exposure can lead to a sweet taste in the mouth and irritation of the throat. It is more likely to occur after a period away from work such as a weekend or holiday. The symptoms resolved too quickly for it to be a flu or cold.

On further questioning it transpires that her mother suffered from a lung / circulatory condition and died a few years after a heart lung transplant, and her aunt died at a young age, from a condition which they were told was heart failure. Her BP is 145/82 mmHg, her pulse is 85 and regular, and her BMI is 22. There is a murmur of tricuspid regurgitation, and bilateral pitting oedema of the ankles. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 126 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 6.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 205 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 136 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 119 µmol/L (79-118)   Echocardiogram Evidence of increased right sided pressures    Which of the following is the most likely mode of inheritance?",Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,De-novo mutation,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,A,"This woman has familial primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH). This is evidenced by her age, and particularly symptoms such as increased shortness of breath and recurrent syncope. The increased right sided pressures are also a give away with respect to the diagnosis. The fact her aunt and mother suffered from a similar disease points to an inherited component. The condition is recognised to account for 15-20% of cases of PPH and is due to an inherited mutation in the BMPR2 gene which codes for a receptor in the TGF beta family. Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia, another cause of inherited pulmonary hypertension, also carries an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The occurrence of pulmonary hypertension in a number of family members makes a de novo mutation highly unlikely. Of the other modes of inheritance listed, only autosomal dominant is correct."
respiratory system,312,"A 41-year-old man with a history of nasal congestion, breathlessness, cough and wheeze presents with a left foot drop. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis,Diabetes mellitus ,Granulomatosis with polyangiitis,Polyarteritis nodosa,Pulmonary eosinophilia ,A,"Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare form of small-vessel vasculitis, characterised by asthma, allergic rhinitis and prominent peripheral blood eosinophilia. Rarely, it can cause either an anterior or a posterior ischaemic optic neuropathy, which presents with visual loss. The most commonly involved organ is the lung, followed by the skin. EGPA, however, can affect any organ system, including the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems. The unifying feature of patients presenting with EGPA is asthma. Vasculitis involving the peripheral nervous system is also a characteristic feature, and mononeuritis multiplex occurs in 75% of patients, which accounts for the foot drop in this case. Vasculitis of extrapulmonary organs is largely responsible for the morbidity and mortality associated with EGPA. 40-60% are associated with positive ANCA, usually pANCA/MPO. Intravenous glucocorticoid is used for initial therapy of acute multi-organ disease, followed by oral glucocorticoid therapy, often with azathioprine as a steroid-sparing agent. Loss of vision must be treated aggressively. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease, which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract, glomerulonephritis and a small-vessel vasculitis. A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia. Hypereosinophilic syndrome is characterised by a peripheral blood eosinophil count of greater than1.5 for more than 6 months. Generalised symptoms are fatigue, myalgia, fever, night sweats, diarrhoea and pruritus. Other symptoms depend on the organ involved: cardiac disease causes chest pain and dyspnoea, respiratory disease presents with a dry cough. Diabetes mellitus can cause a mononeuritis multiplex (and therefore a foot drop), however the other features do not fit with this diagnosis. Polyarteritis nodosa is a vasculitis which affects medium and small arteries, resulting in microaneurysms, aneurysmal rupture, thrombosis and subsequently organ ischaemia and infarction. It most commonly affects skin, joints, peripheral nerves, the gastrointestinal tract and the kidney. The lungs are usually spared. A typical presentation is with fever, night sweats, weight loss, skin ulceration and tender nodules, and severe muscle and joint pains. "
respiratory system,313,"A 72-year-old man is receiving chemotherapy for SCLC (small cell lung cancer). He has his 4th treatment 8 days ago. He has a cough with some green sputum but feels well. Temperature 37.6C. Chest examination: few coarse crepitations in the right base. HR 92 bpm. CBC: Hgb 12.5 g/dL, WBC 1.1, Neutrophils 0.6, Platelets 89. Sputum, urine and blood culture sent to microbiology. What is the most appropriate management?",Broad spectrum antibiotics IV,Broad spectrum antibiotics PO,GCSF,Postpone tx until bacteriology results available,Reassure and send home,A,The diagnosis is lower respiratory tract infection in association with neutropenia resulted from chemotherapy. Treated with broad spectrum antibiotics. For chemotherapy induced neutropenia GCSF (granulocyte colony stimulating factor) is given subcutaneously
respiratory system,314,A 20-year-old female with cystic fibrosis presents in early pregnancy wanting advice. Genetic analysis reveals that her partner is a carrier of the cystic fibrosis gene. Which of the following percentages best represents the chance of her child having cystic fibrosis?,10%,25%,50%,75%,100%,C,The patient is homozygous for CF (CF/CF) and the father is heterozygous for CF (CF/N). Thus there is a 50% chance that her child will be homozygous for CF and a 50% chance that the child will be a carrier.
respiratory system,315,Which of the following is classified as a major risk factor in the development of venous thromboembolism (relative risk 5-20)?,COPD,Hormone replacement therapy (HRT),Obesity,Oral contraceptive pill,Varicose veins,E,"Accordingly to the latest British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines for pulmonary embolism, lower limb problems including a fracture or varicose veins are classed as a major risk factor in the development of VTE. Other major risk factors include:  postoperative intensive care hospitalisation abdominal/pelvic or advanced malignancy previous VTE, and pregnancy.  The other risk factors listed in the question are classed as minor risk factors with a relative risk of 2-4. Other minor risk factors include:  occult malignancy long distance travel hypertension congestive cardiac failure, and thrombotic disorder.  "
respiratory system,316,Which of the following is not useful in the diagnosis of occupational asthma in the primary care setting?,FEV1/FVC ratio,Serial peak flow measurement at home and work,Specific bronchial provocation testing,Transfer factor,Response to salbutamol,B,Serial peak flow measurement is the most useful in its diagnosis and will show a reduction in peak flow at work.    FEV1/FVC ratio will be reduced and there may be  reversibility wit salbutamol differentiating it from COPD.  Specific bronchial provocation testing is the gold standard but is only present in a specialist setting and is not widely available.
respiratory system,317,"A 12-year-old presents with chest pain. Examination: tachycardia, hypotension, dilated neck veins and the trachea is not centrally placed. What is the next appropriate management?",Portable XR,Needle thoracocenthesis,Chest drainage,ABG,CTPA,B,A case of tension pneumothorax
respiratory system,318,A 45-year-old man presents with a three month history of wheezing and dyspnoea whilst at work. His symptoms improve significantly when at home and at weekends. What is the likely causative agent?,Asbestos,Cotton dust,Isocyanates,Silica,Simple coal worker's lung,C,"This patient presents with typical symptoms of occupational asthma and the most likely causative substance is isocyanate which is used in the manufacture of foams/plastics. There are an estimated 1500 to 3000 cases of occupational asthma reported each year. The most commonly implicated substances in occupational asthma are isocyanates, flour/grain, adhesives, metals, resins, colophony, fluxes, latex, animals, aldehydes and wood dust. Cotton dust can be associated, but is less recognised than isocyanates. Asbestos is associated with pleural plaques, pleural thickening, pleural effusions, interstitial lung disease, mesothelioma and lung carcinoma but not occupational asthma. Silica (which is found in coal dust) exposure results in pulmonary fibrosis. Simple coal worker's disease describes a nodular interstitial lung disease. "
respiratory system,319,A patient who was previously a coal miner is found on chest xray to have numerous small round opacities with normal lung markings. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Simple pneumoconiosis category 1,Progressive massive fibrosis,Silicosis,Simple pneumoconiosis category 2,Simple pneumoconiosis category 3,D,This gentleman is most likely to be suffering from simple pneumoconiosis as he is an ex coal miner. Simple pneumoconiosis is categorised based on its CXR findings. In category 1 there is a few small round opacities. In category 2 there is numerous small round opacities but normal lung markings visible. Category 3 is characterised by very numerous opacities with normally lung markings partially or totally obscured.
respiratory system,320,"In regards to cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, which of the following is not true?",Normal to  high FEV1/FVC,Reduced FVC,Poor lung compliance,Reduced elastic recoil,Reduced FEV1,D,CFA leads to a fibrotic ppicture on pulmonary functions tests and thus there is poor lung compliance as the lungs are stiff and increased elastic recoil.  The other features are in keeping with a fibrotic picture.
respiratory system,321,A patient with asthma presents with a productive cough and breathlessness. A Chest X-ray reveals loss of volume in the left hemithorax  and there appears to be an opacity behind the heart shadow and the left hemidiaphragm is obscured. Which of the following is the most likely cause?,Normal variant,Pleural effusion,Mucous plugging,Pulmonary Embolus,Pneumonia,C,The findings on CXR are indicative of a left lower collapse. In asthma there is excessive mucous production which can lead to obstruction and lobar collapse. In pneumonia you would expect to see an area of consolidation. The Xray findings are not inkeeping with a pleural effusion of pulmonary embolus.
respiratory system,322,Which oxygen delivery device should be utilised in COPD patients?,CPAP,Simple face mask,Trauma mask,Nasal cannulae,Venturi mask,E,Venturi delivery devices are oxygen masks which provide a specific oxygen concentration. It is important to monitor the oxygen concentration being delivered COPD due to the risk of CO2 retention. Trauma masks should be used in emergencies but should not be utilised in the management for any length of time and should be used very cautiously in COPD patients.
respiratory system,323,A 42 year old with Rheumatoid arthritis presents with increasing dyspnoea and a non productive cough. A CXR reveals diffuse reticular opacities and pulmonary functions tests reveal a restrictive pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Bronchiolitis obliterans with organising pneumonia,Asthma,COPD,Interstitial lung disease,Caplans Syndrome,D,Rheumatoid arthritis can effect the lungs. It can lead to pulmonary fibrosis with interstitial lung damage. It is thought to occur in 2 to 5%. Pulmonary fibrosis can also occur secondary to DMARDs such as methotrexate. Caplans syndrome is the association of rheumatoid nodules with pneumoconiosis. BOOP does not present in this fashion. COPD and asthma lead to obstructive pattern on pulmonary function tests.
respiratory system,324,"A 36-year-old man who is a known asthmatic complains of persistent cough and shortness of breath, which is unresponsive to his normal inhaled therapy. A CXR shows fibrosis of both upper lobes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ,Ankylosing spondylitis,Cystic fibrosis,Primary pulmonary hypertension,Systemic sclerosis,A,"The persistent cough is likely to be a symptom of asthma. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitivity reation to the colonisation of the respiratory tract with Aspergillus. It predominantly affects patients with asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. The clinical manifestations include fever, wheeze, cough (which can result in haemoptysis and expectoration of large mucus plugs), chronic sinusitis and malaise. Left untreated it can progress to pulmonary infiltrates and fibrosis (which is predominantly apical). Diagnosis is made when a patient's underlying respiratory disease deteriorates, in the presence of eosinophilia, a positive skin test to Aspergillus, elevated IgE, positive Aspergillus serology or infiltrated on CXR or CT. High-dose steroids, with or without itraconazole, are the mainstay of treatment. This has minimal benefit if fibrosis is already established. Whilst systemic sclerosis and ankylosing spondylitis can cause pulmonary fibrosis, you would expect there to be a history of connective tissue symptoms rather than only asthma. Primary pulmonary hypertension is commoner in women, and does not cause pulmonary fibrosis. A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is likely to have been made prior to age 36 (although some genotypes do not present until later in life, so in clinical practice do not exclude it on the basis of age alone)."
respiratory system,325,A 72 year old male who was previously a ship builder presents with increasing shortness of breath and reduced exercise tolerance. He smokes 40 per day. On examination there is evidence of finger clubbing and fine bibasal inspiratory crackles. A Chest Xray reveals pleural plaques and interstitial changes in both lower zones. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Mesothelioma,Bronchial Carcinoma,COPD,Pleural plaques,Asbestosis,E,"This history, clinical features and investigations are indicative of asbestosis. Asbestosis also leads to a interstitial lung disease and thus restrictive pattern on PFTs. Pleural plaques alone do not lead to the symptoms. Mesothelioma would be suspected if there was an effusion, weight loss or pleural thickening."
respiratory system,326,"A 43-year-old Caribbean female comprehensive school teacher complains of slowly increasing breathlessness. She has no smoking history. Investigations reveal she has bilateral enlarged hilar lymph nodes, elevated serum calcium, interstitial lung disease, and enlarged liver and spleen. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Coccidioidomycosis,Hyperparathyroidism,Hypervitaminosis D,Sarcoidosis,Tuberculosis,D,"Sarcoid is common in subjects of Caribbean origin. Subacute increasing breathlessness also suggests the diagnosis of sarcoid, and an elevated calcium narrows the differential diagnosis further. Hyperparathyroidism would not cause symptoms of breathlessness. Coccidioidomycosis is a non-infective fungal infection caused by inhalation of the spores of Coccidioides immitis. It usually presents with fever, cough, myalgia and rash. It is endemic mainly to the south-western USA and North Mexico. TB is the major differential in this case. Hypercalcaemia and bilateral hilar lymphadenomegaly (BHL) however are in favour of a diagnosis of sarcoid."
respiratory system,327,A patient with rheumatoid arthritis complains of progressive breathlessness. Which of the following is the most likely cause?,Asthma ,Fibrosing alveolitis,Pulmonary embolus,Pulmonary eosinophilia,Pulmonary nodules ,B,"Fibrosing alveolitis associated with rheumatoid arthritis is indistinguishable from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It presents with progressive breathlessness and cough. Signs include:  finger clubbing cyanosis, and bilateral end inspiratory crackles.  Other pulmonary complications of rheumatoid arthritis include:  pleural effusions empyema cryptogenic organising pneumonia bronchiectasis, and pulmonary nodules.  The latter are usually asymptomatic but may cavitate, resulting in haemoptysis, and when occurring with coal workers pneumoconiosis (Caplan's syndrome) are associated with breathlessness."
respiratory system,328,"A 52 year old gentleman has just returned from a cruise.  He has developed had been unwell with fever, headache, myalgia and diarrhoea and vomiting with a dry cough.  His cough is now more severe, with occasional haemoptysis and dyspnoea.  Bloods reveal elevated WCC and CRP, hyponatraemia and deranged LFTs.  What is the most likely causative agent?",Klebsiella,Staphylcoccus Aureus,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Legionella pneumophila,Streptococcus Pneumoniae,D,"Legionella leads to a pneumonia associated with GI symptoms, headache and fever often predominating initially.  Hyponatraemia (secondary to SIADH) and deranged LFTs are also a clue to the diagnosis and the other options are less likely to lead to these findings.  Mycoplasma pneumoniae can lead to flu like illness and headache however does not commonly lead to GI symptoms.  Legionella is caused by legionella pneumophila and often contaminated water supplies are the source.  Diagnosis can be confirmed via blood culture isolation.  There is now a urinary antigen screen for legionella to aid in the diagnosis.  Erythromycin and doxycycline are useful in the diagnosis."
respiratory system,329,"A 21-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with an hour history of chest tightness, dyspnoea, tingling in her hands and light-headedness. She has neither past medical history nor family history of note. Examination is unremarkable aside from an elevated respiratory rate. Her pulse oximetry shows saturations of 96% on air, which do fall when she walks across the room. A chest x ray is also normal. An arterial blood gas sample (on air and at rest) is obtained and the results are as follows:    pH 7.52 (7.36 - 7.44)   pCO2 2.2kPa (4.7 - 6.0)   pO2 9.1kPa (11.3 - 12.6)   HCO3 25 mmol/L (20 - 28)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute asthma attack,Hyperventilation (psychogenic),Pulmonary embolism,Respiratory muscle disease,Volume depletion,C,"This patient's blood gas sample shows respiratory alkalosis, as demonstrated by the raised pH, low pCO2 and normal bicarbonate. He pO2 is over 8kPa, and she is therefore not technically in type 1 respiratory failure, but it is important to realise she is working hard to maintain this oxygenation. The most likely cause is an acute pulmonary embolism given the relative hypoxia, and saturation dropping on exertion. Given her age she may be taking the oral contraceptive pill, which would be a risk factor. In acute asthma the pCO2 may be low, as the patient has an elevated respiratory rate, however in this instance there should be a history of the condition, clinical signs or a reduced pO2. Hyperventilation often demonstrates a respiratory alkalosis picture on analysis, however she should have a normal pO2 and her saturations should not fall on exertion. Respiratory muscle disease typically results in a respiratory acidosis. Volume depletion (from a number of causes) would typically cause a metabolic alkalosis."
respiratory system,330,"A 25-year-old patient came to the OPD with complaint of fever, malaise, breathlessness, cough and anorexia. His girl friend has got similar symptoms. He had history of sore throat and ear discharge a month ago. What is the single most likely causative organism?",Legionella,Mycoplasma,Chlamydia pneumonia,PCP,Chlamydia psitacci,C,Please note sorethroat is a clue for chlamydia as well as about 4 weeks prior exposure history is also a pointer
respiratory system,331,"A 62-year-old man, who has worked for a long period of his life as a boiler lagger, presents to the clinic for review. He is worried as over the past year he has suffered increasingly severe shortness of breath with a dry cough. He also reports that his fingers have begun to change shape. His GP has given him a salbutamol inhaler but it has had little effect on his symptoms. He also describes unexplained weight loss over the last 3 months. Other history includes smoking of 10 cigarettes per day, and hypertension for which he takes indapamide. On examination his BP is 142/72 mmHg, his pulse is 80 and regular, and he looks short of breath at rest. There are inspiratory basal crackles. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 131 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 7.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 152 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 µmol/L (79-118)   pH 7.42 (7.35-7.45)   pCO2 4.2 kPa (4.8-6.1)   pO2 9.3 kPa (10-13.3)    Chext x ray shows nodular opacification, most prominent at the lung bases. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Asbestosis,Asthma,COPD,Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,Tuberculosis,A,"The likely exposure to asbestos from working in the boiler industry means that the changes seen here including signs of fibrosis on examination, hypoxia and chest x ray radiograph changes are most likely to be due to asbestosis. Progressive lung fibrosis occurs, eventually leading to respiratory failure, and the fibrotic changes are non-steroid responsive. Whilst he has been given an inhaler by his GP, there is nothing on the examination to suggest either chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, by definition, has an unknown cause and therefore asbestosis is more likely here. The onset of asbestosis is typically over 20 years following exposure. The fibrotic changes are more pronounced in the lower lobes, and are heard as fine end inspiratory crackles. Patients present with exertional dyspnoea. Chest radiographs may be normal in early disease, when high resolution CT is more sensitive at demonstrating the characteristic changes (and may demonstrate associated pleural disease). In the later stages, chest radiographs show honeycombing. Spirometry reveals a restrictive defect with a reduced transfer factor. Given this patient has a long history of repeated exposure and weight loss asbestosis is more suggestive than IPF. There is no specific treatment for asbestosis. Further exposure should be avoided, and patients should be vaccinated against pneumococcus and influenza. Patients should be advised to stop smoking (if they do) and long-term oxygen therapy may be required."
respiratory system,332,"A 33 year old male with HIV presents unwell. He has a cough productive of green sputum, is short of breath and is pyrexial. He is noticed to desaturate on minimal exertion. On examination there is a few crackles bibasally. A chest X ray reveal perihilar bilateral diffuse infiltrates. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia,Legionella,Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia,Klebsiella pneumoniae pneumonia,B,"This patient presents with a pneumonia. The clue to the underlying diagnosis is the desaturation on exertion, chest xray findings and minimal findings on chest which are all indicative of pneumocystis jiroveci. Klebsiella tens to lead to upper lobe cavitating lesions and staphylococcus aureus lead to multilobar consolidation."
respiratory system,333,Which of the following is the most useful in predicting survival in a patient with COPD?,Echo,FEV1,CXR findings,FVC,CT chest findings,B,FEV1 is the most useful investigation for predicting survival although raised pulmonary artery pressure would also indicate a poor prognosis.
respiratory system,334,A 25 year old female has an acute asthma attack.  She is tachycardic and is tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 35.  On auscultation she is very wheezy but is beginning to tire.  Her peak flow is bout one third of her normal.  She is commenced on both salbutamol and ipratropium nebulisers and IV hydrocortisone however has not greatly improved.  Her gases reveal a high normal CO2 level and low normal O2 level on a trauma mask.  Which other treatment option is the most appropriate to be be tried whilst waiting for ITU to assess the patient?,IV Salbutamol,IV aminophylline,CPAP,IV Magnesium sulphate,BiPAP,D,"IV magnesium sulphate can be useful in the management of a life threatening acute asthma attack.  Any patient attending with features of a life threatening attack such as PEF less than 33%, exhaustion or silent chest then ITU should be informed.  HE CO2 being high normal is very worrying.  IV salbutamol and IV aminophylline are not routinely recommended and should be commenced by seniors.  This patient requires ventilation and CPAP and BiPAP are not appropriate."
respiratory system,335,"A 39-year-old chef, who arrived in the United Kingdom from Pakistan eight months ago, presents to the chest clinic with a two month history of weight loss, dry cough and night sweats. Investigations reveal he has multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). What is the minimum overall duration of treatment for MDR-TB once the sputum is negative?",3 months,6 months,9 months,12 months,24 months,C,"This question requires an understanding of the definition of MDR-TB and the differences in treatment duration. Multi-drug-resistant TB as the name suggests is Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to two or more first line agents, which most commonly are isoniazid and rifampicin. There can be monoresistance to each of the first line agents, but this is not MDR-TB. Treatment of MDR-TB is complex and time consuming. Treatment must be continued for a minimum of 18 months, with at least 9 months of treatment after the patient becomes culture-negative.  Risk factors for acquiring MDR-TB include previous TB treatment, HIV infection, contact with drug resistant disease and treatment failure. Initial treatment includes the use of five agents until sputum is negative and then continuation of three to which the TB is sensitive to for a minimum of nine months but sometimes up to 24 months."
respiratory system,336,In systemic sclerosis which one of the following autoantibodies is atrongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis?,Anti nuclear antibody,Anti RNA polymerase III,Anti topoisomerase1,Anti centromere,Anti RNA polymerase I,C,Anti topoisomerase/scl 70 is strongly associated with pulmonary fibrosis whilst anti centromereis thought to provide protection from lung involvement. Anti RNA polymerase I and III are more strongly associated with renal involvement.
respiratory system,337,A 52 year old gentleman who is homeless and known to drink excessively presents with fever and a cough productive of green sputum which is blood tinged. A CXR reveals consolidation in the right upper lobe with evidence of cavitation. Which of the following is the most likely causative agent?,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,M. Tuberculosis,A,Klebsiella is more commmon in the homeless and those with alcohol dependency. It normally leads to a pneumonia which commonly affects the upper lobes and can lead to cavitation.
respiratory system,338,A 55-year-old woman with a persistent cough and history of smoking develops left sided chest pain exacerbated by deep breathing with fever and localized crackles. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?,Dissecting aneurysm,Pericarditis,Pneumonia,Pneumothorax,Pulmonary embolism,C,"chest pain exacerbated with deep breathing, fever and localized crackles are highly suggestive of pneumonia"
respiratory system,339,Which of the following is true of carcinoma of the bronchus?,Is more common in women,Is not associated with exposure to ionising radiation,May cause unilateral ptosis,May lead to Conn's syndrome,Small cell type is common in young adults,C,"Carcinoma of the bronchus is more common in men than women. Their incidence increases with:  Advancing age History of smoking Exposure to radiation, and Industrial pollutants such as asbestos, iron oxide and chromium.  Small cell carcinoma occurs most commonly in the middle-aged and the elderly. The complications are a result of the tumour impinging or eroding the surrounding vital structures:  Involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy leading to hoarseness of voice Compression of the oesophagus leading to dysphagia Pressure on the superior vena cava leading to facial engorgement, and Horner's syndrome (Pancoast's tumour).  Cushing's syndrome may be seen in patients with small cell carcinomas due to ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)."
respiratory system,340,A 42-year-old lady re-attends the chest clinic following investigations that have confirmed a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. Which of the following would be a poor prognostic sign?,Caucasian race,Current smoker,Erythema nodosum,Lupus pernio,Markedly elevated serum ACE level,D,"The American Thoracic Society has produced a statement on the prognostic indicators associated with sarcoidosis. Lupus pernio is a chronic raised indurated (hardened) lesion of the skin, often purplish in colour, and is associated with sarcoid. It is noted to be an adverse prognostic factor. Other adverse prognostic factors include;  Age of onset greater than40 years Afro-Caribbean or Afro-American race Cardiac involvement Chronic hypercalcaemia Nasal mucosal involvement Neurosarcoidosis Progressive pulmonary sarcoidosis."
respiratory system,341,"A 32-year-old man working in a shipyard comes with SOB (shortness of breath). Examination: dullness on left side of the chest, pain in left side of chest, pleuritic rub and crackles been heard on the same side. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Pericarditis,Pleurisy,Pleural effusion,CCF,TB,C,Shipyard worker are exposed to asbestos and presenting case has developed mesothelioma causing pleura thickening and pleural effusion. Though it is usual that in pleural effusion pleural rub reduces or becomes absent but it is also possible to get pleural rub even in pleural effusion and the likely diagnosis is pleural effusion here
respiratory system,342,"You are called to see a 67-year-old lady on the ward because of severe dyspnoea. She was admitted three days ago with an exacerbation of COPD. Her respiratory rate is 36 /min, temp 37.2°C and BP 136/80 mmHg with a pulse of 102 / min. O2 sat is 88% on 35 % O2 (venturi mask). Her chest shows scattered wheezes with decreased air entry. She is on IV antibiotics, nebulised B2 agonists, ipratropium and oral prednisolone 30 mg. You check her blood gases and the results are as follows:    Ph 7.28 (7.35-7.45)   PCO2 9.4 (4.7-6.0)   PO2 6.8 (11.3-12.6)   Bicarbonate 29mmol/L (21-29)    Which is the best option for her next treatment?",BIPAP (bilevel positive airway pressure ),CPAP ( continuous positive airway pressure),Decrease O2 to 28%,Intravenous corticosteroids,Mechanical ventilation,A,"This patient has an exacerbation of COPD, defined as sustained worsening of the patient's symptoms which is acute in onset. This may include worsening breathlessness, cough, increased sputum and change in sputum colour. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. Supporting investigations include a chest radiograph, arterial blood gases, ECG, routine bloods and sputum and blood cultures. Treatment is with bronchodilators, nebulised in the majority of patients. If a patient is hypercapnic or acidotic, as in this case, these should be driven by compressed air. If oxygen therapy is needed it should be administered simultaneously by nasal cannulae. Oxygen should be given to maintain SaO2 within the patient's individual target range, if available (COPD patients are being given cards with this information, so always ask). ABGs should be repeated at regular intervals to monitor response to treatment, and oxygen weaned when available. High-flow oxygen can potentially worsen hypercapnia and should be avoided. Oral corticosteroids should also be given: 30mg prednisolone for 7-14 days. Prolonged courses offer no additional benefit. Intravenous can be used if the patient is unable to tolerate oral tablets. The effect is delayed, and nebuliser therapy should be initiated first. Antibiotics should be used to treat exacerbations associated with more purulent sputum, consolidation on chest radiograph, or clinical signs of pneumonia. Empirical antibiotic choice should be guided by local policy, and altered to take account of any subsequent culture results. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the treatment of choice for persistent hypercapnic ventilation failure despite optimal medical therapy. It has been shown in RCTs to reduce intubation rate and mortality in COPD patients with decompensated respiratory acidosis (pH less than7.35 and pCO2 greater than6kPa). NIV should therefore be considered within the first 60 minutes of hospital arrival in all patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in whom a respiratory acidosis persists despite maximal medical therapy (controlled oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium, prednisolone, antibiotic (where indicated)). Exceptions may be: life threatening hypoxaemia (when invasive ventilation may be more appropriate), severe co-morbidity, severe cognitive impairment (where NIV is not tolerated), facial burns/trauma/surgery, vomiting, fixed upper airway obstruction, undrained pneumothorax, upper GI surgery, unprotected airway, copious respiratory secretions, haemodynamic instability requiring inotropes. Patients should be sitting or semi-recumbant, and a full-face mask used initially. An initial inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 10cm H2O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 4-5cm H2O should be used. IPAP should be increased by 2-5cm increments every 10 minutes, with a usual target of 20cm H2O or until a therapeutic response is achieved. Oxygen can be introduced into the circuit, usually with a target saturation of 88-92%. Bronchodilators are preferably administered off NIV. Patients should be closely monitored, including ABG, respiratory rate and heart rate. ABGs should be repeated after 1 hour of NIV therapy, and 1 hour after subsequent change in settings or 4 hours in stable patients. All non-invasive ventilation services should have their own local protocol based on these guidelines. There should be a clear plan of what to do in the event of deterioration. Patients with a pH less than7.26 should be managed with a low threshold for intubation. Functional status, BMI, requirement for oxygen when stable, comorbidities and previous admissions should be considered in addition to age and FEV1 when assessing suitability. Whilst in clinical practice you would give NIV whilst awaiting consideration from intensive care, it is important to consider intubation in a patient who is failing to improve. This lady is already severely hypoxic, and reducing her FiO2 is only going to worsen it. She needs help to 'blow off' her pCO2 and reducing the FiO2 isn't going to do this. It would result in a worsening of the pO2 (which would be life-threatening) with most likely no significant change in the pCO2. BiPAP is the only option available which will improve O2 delivery whilst also removing CO2."
respiratory system,343,A 65-year-old man has incurable bronchial cancer. He is unable to cough up his secretions. This is leading to a distressing cough. Which of the following drugs is most likely to help him?,Scopolamine,Xanomeline,Aceclidine,Pilocarpine,Cevimiline,A,Any secretory condition of lung is reduced and improved with scopolamine
respiratory system,344,In bronchiectasis which part of the airway is affected?,Alveoli,Terminal Bronchioles,Bronchi,Parenchyma,Trachea,C,"Bronchiectasis is a persistent or progressive condition which is characterised by dilated thick wall bronchi. The terminal bronchioles are effected in COPD There are 3 classifications: Cylindrical where bronchi are enlarged and cylindrical; Varicose where bronchi are irregular with areas of dilatation and constriction and the most severe form cystic/saccular where the dilated bronchi form clusters of cysts. There is numerous causes which include cystic fibrosis, post infection, viral and bacterial, Immunodeficiency, gastric aspiration, primary ciliary dyskenesia, alpha 1 antitrypsin and yellow nail syndrome. Other causes include post obstruction by tumour, lymphadenopathy and foreign bodies and some autoimmune disease. A purulent cough is the main feature however dyspnoea, chest pain and haemoptysis can occur. HRCT is the gold standard for diagnosis and reveals bronchial wall dilatation. Serum immunoglobulins should be performed to exclude antibody deficiency as an underlying cause. Aspergillus precipitins should be measured to ensure this is not an underlying cause. Other tests include measurement of sweat chloride and CFTR to exclude cystic fibrosis as the underlying cause and ciliary function tests. PFTS, sputum microbiology and bronchoscopy may all be indicated."
respiratory system,345,"A 32-year-old woman presented with daytime sleepiness and fatigue. She does not take any regular medications. She denies snoring at night. On detailed history, she describes having episodes of probable cataplexy. Clinical examination is unremarkable. Thyroid function tests are normal. The patient is suspected of having narcolepsy. Which of the following tests will be most useful in diagnosis?",Genetic analysis,High hypocretin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis,Multiple sleep latency test,Polysomnography,Trial of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),C,Cataplexy is an important feature of narcolepsy. There is lower than normal hypocretin levels in CSF. There is high rate of HLA-DQB1*0602 but this is not diagnostic but associated. Polysomnography can sometimes be done to exclude obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) but will not diagnose narcolepsy. Nasal CPAP is used in treatment of OSA and not used for narcolepsy. Hypocretin levels are usually low in narcolepsy.
respiratory system,346,Which of the following best describes these blood gas result?,Metabolic acidosis ‐ respiratory compensation,Respiratory failure ‐compensated,"Metabolic alkalosis ‐ acute, normal oxygenation",Respiratory failure ‐ compensated with hypoxaemia,Normal ventilation with hypoxaemia,B,"This is the typical feature of a respiratory failure. Hypoxaemia is a consequence of respiratory failure and not a compensatory mechanism, i.e. respiratory failure is COMPLICATED by hypoxaemia but COMPENSATED by renal mechanisms and an increase in bicarbinate.The PaO2 is low, the PaCO2 is high, with raised bicarbonate indicating metabolic compensation and a high base excess."
respiratory system,347,"A 38 year old male returned from travelling around Asia 6 months ago. He presents with a nocturnal dry cough, shortness of breath and wheeze. He is commenced on a salbutamol inhaler. However he returns with fever, weight loss and listlessness. Bloods reveal an eosinophilia and elevated IgE. A CXR reveals bilateral hazy mottling. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Asthma,Churg-Strauss Syndrome,Tropical Pulmonary Eosinophilia,Aspergilloma,Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis,C,"The history, clinical findings and CXR are characteristic of reopical pulmonary eosinophilia. It is due to a hyperresponsiveness to human filarial parasites, Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi and typically presents as in this case. It is observed in the Asian subcontinent. Diagnosis can be confirmed by demonstration of filarial antigen or antibodies. It is treated with diethylcarbamazine.  In ABPA weight loss is not typical, cough is productive and due to the travel history tropical pulmonary eosinophilia is more likely."
respiratory system,348,A 70 year old patient who was previously a coal miner presents with significant dyspnoea and a cough which is sometimes productive of black sputum. On CXR there is large round fibrotic masses in the upper lobes. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Silicosis,Progressive massive fibrosis,Simple pneumoconiosis category 3,Simple pneumoconiosis category 2,Simple pneumoconiosis category 1,B,This gentleman is most likely to be suffering from progressive massive fibrosis given the history and radiological findings. Simple pneumoconiosis is categorised based on its CXR findings. In category 1 there is a few small round opacities. In category 2 there is numerous small round opacities but normal lung markings visible. Category 3 is characterised by very numerous opacities with normally lung markings partially or totally obscured. PMF rarely develops on category 1 pneumoconiosis but develops in about 7 % of category 2 and 30% of category 3.
respiratory system,349,"A 70-year-old lady with a significant smoking history is referred to the rapid access chest clinic with a three month history of weight loss, a cough and three episodes of haemoptysis. She is otherwise fit and well. On questioning she has a troublesome cough, some mild right sided chest pain which she describes as an ache and finds she gets fatigued more easily. However she is still able to complete the majority of her usual tasks unaided, although she finds these take her longer than before. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) classification, what is her performance status?",0,1,2,3,4,B,"Assessing a patient's performance status is important when evaluating the most appropriate treatment options. It is commonly used by cancer MDTs, but has a role in assessing patients with chronic illnesses including COPD.    WHO (Zubrod) Scale Description   0 Asymptomatic   1 Symptomatic but ambulatory (can carry out light work)   2 In bed less than 50% of the day.

respiratory system,350,"A 48-year-old male presents feeling progressively short of breath and 'wheezy' for the last couple of months. He smokes 30 a day for the last 20 years. He had lung function tests which showed the following. His FEV1 (forced expiratory value in one second) was 2.1 litres and his FEV1 /FVC (Forced Vital Capacity) ratio was 50%. His diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DL,CO) was 105% of the average value expected for his age and gender. What is the FVC and what is the most likely diagnosis?",1.05L and Emphysema,1.05L and Idiopathic Pulmonary fibrosis,2.1L and Neuromuscular Disorder,4.2L and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD),4.2L and Pneumonitis,D,"This patient has a FEV1 /FVC ratio of 0.5 and FEV1 is 2.1 L the FVC is 2.1L divided by 0.5 which is that same as 2.1 multiplied by 2 which equals 4.2L. This patient's FEV1 /FVC ratio is 50% which highlights this patient has an obstructive airway picture as it is less than 80%. The three main causes of obstructive air way disease are:  asthma COPD, and emphysema.  It is important to consider lung cancer in the above patient due to the history and a tumour compressing on larger bronchial airway could present with a reduced FEV1 /FVC ratio. The diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide test measures efficiency of the transfer of gas from air in the lung, to the red blood cells in lung blood vessels. It is reduced (less than 75% expected in a person of the same gender and age) in the following diseases:  Loss of lung parenchyma (emphysema etc.). Diseases that scar the lung tissue (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis etc.) Swelling of lung tissue (pulmonary oedema) Acute inflammatory response to allergens (acute interstitial pneumonitis etc.) Diseases of the blood vessels in the lung (pulmonary vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension etc.)   It is increased greater than 125% expected in a person of the same gender and age in the following diseases:  Alveolar haemorrhage (Goodpasture's syndrome etc.) Polycythaemia, Left to right intracardiac shunts   This patient has a normal DL,CO which rules out of emphysema and makes COPD the most likely diagnosis out the options given.

respiratory system,351,A 15-year-old boy presented with wheezing when playing football and nocturnal cough. Which is the best test initially to confirm the underlying condition?,A trial of inhaled corticosteroids,A trial of inhaled salbutamol,A trial of oral corticosteroids,Serial peak expiratory flow rate measurements,Spirometry alone,E,New guideance says that any child with a relevant clincal history or examination suspicious of asthma should have spirometry performed rather than a trial of salbutamol aspreviously stated in old NICE guidelines.     
respiratory system,352,"A 62-year-old man has been smoking about 15 cigarettes/day for 45 years, and has been working as a builder since he was 24 years old. He presents with chest pain, SOB (shortness of breath), weight loss. CXR shows bilateral fibrosis and left side pleural effusion. What is the best investigation that will lead to diagnosis?",CXR,Pleural fluid aspiration of cytology,MRI,Pleural biopsy,CT,D,There is asbestos exposure in builders and associated smoking greatly increases the possibility of developing mesothelioma and the given presentations are typical of mesothelioma. Best investigation is pleural biopsy
respiratory system,353,"A 22 year old female who has previously suffered from panic attacks presents with acute shortness of breath, palpitations, perioral tingling and paraesthesia in hands and chest tightness. Given the most likely diagnosis, what would you expect to observe on blood gas?",High CO2,Metabolic acidosis,High O2,Low CO2,Low O2,D,This patient is most likely suffering from hyperventilation. The clue to the diagnosis is the previous panic attacks. The ABGs are likely to show low CO2 which would account for the perioral tingling and paraesthesia.
respiratory system,354,"A 52 year old female has been diagnosed with a non small bronchial carcinoma in the left upper lobe. Following further investigation it is staged as T1, N1, M0. Her FEV1 is 65% of her predicted. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Radiotherapy,Chemotherapy,Palliative care,Corticosteroids,Pneumonectomy,E,This patient has a non small cell lung cancer confined to one lobe with ipsilateral lymph node involvement and without metastases or carina involvement. Her FEV1 is also reasonable. From this information then a surgical approach is the most appropriate. Non small cell lung cancers are not as responsive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
respiratory system,355,An 18-year-old female is admitted with a depression of her conscious level. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed:    pH 7.26 (7.36-7.44)   pO2 12.1 kPa (11.3-12.6)   pCO2 3.9 kPa (4.7-6.0)   Standard bicarbonate 14.7 mmol/L (20-28)    Which one of the following would account for these results?,Analytical error,Metabolic acidosis,Persistent vomiting,Respiratory acidosis,Respiratory alkalosis,B,This patient has a metabolic acidosis with an effort at respiratory compensation as reflected by elevated pO2 and reduced pCO2. This could be due to poisoning or a condition such as diabetic ketoacidosis. Vomiting would cause a metabolic alkalosis.
respiratory system,356,A 32-year-old previously healthy woman has developed pain and swelling of both knees and ankles with nodular rash over her shins. As part of the investigation a chest X-ray has been performed. What is the single most likely chest Xray appearance?,Apical granuloma,Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy,Lobar consolidation,Pleural effusion,Reticular shadowing in the bases,B,"Diagnosis is sarcoidosis, more specifically Lofgren’s syndrome. It is the triad of i) erythema nodosum ii) bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and iii) arthralgia"

respiratory system,358,Which of the following is a contraindication to radiotherapy in lung cancer?,Liver Metastases,Reduced FEV1/FVC ratio,Malignant pleural effusion,Spinal cord compression,Ischaemic heart disease,C,A malignant pleural effusion is thought to be a contraindication for the use of radiotherapy for lung cancer.
respiratory system,359,"A 64-year-old patient is discussed at the lung cancer MDT following a recent diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (squamous sub-type). He is a current smoker, and is known to have COPD for which he takes inhalers. The lesion appears confined to the right middle lobe, but surgical resection would require a pneumonectomy. Which of the following is a contraindication to his having radical surgery?",Clubbing,FEV1 1.4 L,Hypertrophic pulmonary osteo-arthropathy (HPOA),Hyponatraemia,Mediastinal lymph node measuring 0.9 cm on staging CT,B,"For an intervention to be considered curative there should be no evidence of metastatic spread, and practical considerations such as a patient's respiratory function reserve need to be considered prior to any operation. Assessing fitness for surgery in cases of lung carcinoma can be difficult and requires consideration of a number of factors. Lung function needs to be assessed prior to referral to the thoracic surgical team. A post-bronchodilator FEV1 of greater than1.5 litres is sufficient if a lobectomy is all that is required. If the tumour necessitates a pneumonectomy, the post-bronchodilator FEV should be more than 2 litres. Below these values, further investigation in the form of estimation of transfer factor, oxygen saturations at rest and quantitative isotope perfusion should be undertaken. These values can be used to calculate estimated postoperative FEV1 and postoperative transfer factor. Patients with an estimated postoperative FEV1 less than 40% predicted, transfer factor more than 40% predicted and oxygen saturations of more than 90% on air are considered to be average risk. Those with an FEV1 and transfer factor of less than 40% are thought to be high risk. All other combinations are indications for exercise testing (shuttle walk tests or formal cardiopulmonary exercise tests). High-risk patients identified by this step-wise testing should be discussed at a formal multidisciplinary meeting, and should be considered for more limited resection or non-surgical management. Perioperative morbidity increases with advancing age, and more elderly patients typically require more intensive perioperative support. However, surgery for clinically stage I and II disease can be as effective in patients over the age of 70 and should be considered regardless of age. Age over 80 alone is not a contraindication to lobectomy or wedge resection for stage I disease, but may be a contraindication to pneumonectomy and each case should be assessed individually. Cardiovascular fitness should be assessed with a preoperative ECG. Those with an audible murmur should have an echocardiogram. A recent MI (within six months) is an indication for cardiology opinion prior to surgery. All patients with a history of previous stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, or carotid bruits should be assessed with carotid Doppler studies. Those with significant stenosis should be assessed by a vascular surgeon or stroke physician. Patients presenting with preoperative weight loss of more than 10% and/or performance status of WHO 2 or worse should have their BMI and albumin measured, and metastatic disease carefully excluded. Patients who are anatomically suited to resection but have more than one adverse medical factor should have their management discussed formally at a multidisciplinary meeting. In addition to the above patient factors, there are characteristics of the tumour which will help determine operability. All patients being considered for surgery should have a plain chest radiograph and CT scan of the thorax, liver and adrenal glands. Confirmatory percutaneous biopsy in patients presenting with peripheral lesions is not mandatory, particularly if the lesion was not present on previous chest radiographs. Patients with mediastinal nodes greater than 1cm in diameter on CT should undergo biopsy. Patients with stage I (cT1N0 and cT2N0) and stage II (cT1N1, cT2N1 and cT3N0) tumours should be considered operable. Patients with stage IIIA (cT3N1 and cT1-3N2) tumours have a low chance of being cured by surgery alone, but it can be used in the context of a trial in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy. Stage IIIB and IV tumours should generally be considered inoperable. Whilst most pleural effusions associated with lung carcinoma are due to the tumour (and results in classification as a T4 tumour), in some patients cytological examination of the fluid is negative. If this is confirmed on more than one occasion, and clinical judgement dictates that the effusion is not related to the tumour, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element. This may mean they are suitable for surgery, and therefore it is not the correct answer here. Paraneoplastic conditions, such as clubbing, HPOA and syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) are not linked to the stage of disease and are therefore not automatic contraindications to surgery. "
respiratory system,360,You were asked to see a 50-year-old man who developed haemoptysis. Further evaluation showed pulmonary infiltrates and his urine dipstick showed red cells and active urine sediments. Which of the following evaluations would be most diagnostic?,A request for anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA),A smoking history,An ultrasound image of the kidneys,Anti-Smith (Sm) antibodies,Fractional excretion of sodium,A,"Bleeding into alveolar space can be manifested as haemoptysis, and together with renal disease or glomerulonephritis, should prompt an evaluation for systemic vasculitis. Pulmonary renal syndrome can result from Granulomatosis with polyangiitis or ANCA-associated vasculitis. Goodpasture's syndrome (associated with anti-GBM) is another consideration. Of interest, smoking appears to be of relevance in causing an epitope that incites an immune response (and thus alveolar damage and haemoptysis manifestation), but this piece of information would not be of the most diagnostic value. Kidney biopsy, but not ultrasound alone, is occasionally performed in patients with overt manifestations of renal disease (to look for a segmental necrotising lesion in this case)."
respiratory system,361,You are reviewing chemical pathology results which have come to your acute medicine inbox and are collecting a series from patients with chronic respiratory failure. Which of the following would fit best with a compensated respiratory acidosis?,"pH 6.9, pCO2 3.4, pO2 8.2kPa","pH 7.1, pCO2 3.9kPa, pO2 8.8kPa","pH 7.3, pCO2 3.8kPa, pO2 13.0kPa","pH 7.41, pCO2 7.2kPa, pO2 9.2kPa","pH 7.54, pCO2 4.2 kPa, pO2 12.9kPa",D,"pH 7.41, pCO2 7.2kPa, pO2 9.2kPa is correct. For all of the other options the pH values are abnormal. Bicarbonate values are not given, but the presence of pH, O2 and CO2 enables us to select the correct option. In the correct option the CO2 is raised and the O2 is below the lower limit of normal. The fact that the pH is normal means that there must be bicarbonate retention to compensate. pH 7.3, pCO2 3.8kPa, pO2 13.0kPa is consistent with a metabolic acidosis. pH 6.9, pCO2 3.4, pO2 8.2kPa and pH 7.1, pCO2 3.9kPa, pO2 8.8kPa are consistent with a metabolic acidosis, and also with significant hypoxia. pH 7.54, pCO2 4.2 kPa, pO2 12.9kPa is consistent with a metabolic alkalosis."

In this case, aspiration should be considered. If air aspiration is unsuccessful, a repeat can be attempted. If still unsuccessful then small bore chest drain insertion is the treatment of choice. If there is a previous history of chest disease, the pneumothorax is considered to be secondary. If the patient is younger than 50 and the rim of air is less than 2 cm, aspiration can be attempted. If the patient is older, the rim is larger, or initial aspiration is unsuccessful then a chest drain should be inserted. "
respiratory system,364,"A 32-year-old man who is a lifelong non-smoker presents to the respiratory clinic with shortness of breath, wheeze and a chronic cough. He works as a stone mason carving grave stones and has a property on a farm. At the same time, his father maintains that he only ever used to smoke between five and ten cigarettes per day, yet he is 59-years-old with severe COPD on home oxygen. On examination the patient has bilateral wheeze and coarse crackles consistent with obstructive lung disease. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 121 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 6.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 172 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 88 μmol/L (79-118)   Alanine amino transferase 86 U/L (5-40)   PEFR 280 l/min (Predicted 550)   Chest x ray Evidence of lower lobe emphysema    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,Asthma,Chronic bronchitis,Extrinsic allergic alveolitis,Silicosis,A,"The clues are the very early development of obstructive lung disease, with lower lobe emphysema seen on CXR, and the fact that despite a relatively low pack year history of smoking, his father has developed severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Many patients with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency develop significant liver disease, including cirrhosis, and the raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) seen here is suggestive of that. Management of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency is similar to that for smoking-related COPD, with high dose inhaled steroids and bronchodilators. Additionally, patients should be advised to avoid consumption of alcohol as this can exacerbate the liver disease. Alpha-1-antitrypsin replacement is available, but currently it is not recommended by NICE in their guidance on Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in over 16s: diagnosis and management (NG115)  The presence of emphysema and persistent rather than episodic symptoms make asthma less likely.  Chronic bronchitis is a constituent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but the family history and the fact that this gentleman is a lifelong non-smoker makes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficincy much more likely.  Extrinsic allergic alveolitis causes a recurrent pneumonitis, which can result in emphysema. In this scenario, we are not given a history of exposure to a causative agent or any suggestion that the symptoms are episodic again makes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency more likely.  This gentleman may be exposed to crystalline silica dust, inhalation of which leads to silicosis, but radiologically this is characterised by nodular scarring of the upper lobes rather than emphysema."
respiratory system,365,A 43-year-old man with asthma develops worsening breathlessness and his full blood count has revealed an eosinophilia. A diagnosis of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is suspected. Which of the following statements is true with regard to this diagnosis?,Circulating IgG precipitins to Aspergillus fumigatus are positive,Pleural effusion is a complication,Recurrent haemoptysis is a characteristic feature,The CO transfer factor is unaffected,The immediate skin test to an extract of Aspergillus fumigatus is negative,A,"Immediate (type I) reactions occur in virtually all patients with ABPA following intradermal injections of A. fumigatus extracts, with only 16% developing delayed (type IV) reactions. Precipitating IgG antibodies are present in 70% of patients. Transfer factor may be affected in the later fibrotic stage of the disease.

respiratory system,366,A 55-year-old woman on treatment for longstanding rheumatoid arthritis has recently become dyspnoeic on mild exertion and developed a dry cough. The oxygen saturation was found to be 87% on air. The chest x ray showed a diffuse bilateral interstitial infiltrate. An extensive infection screen was negative and her symptoms were thought to be drug-induced. Which drug is most likely to have caused this adverse effect?,Azathioprine,Cyclosporin,Hydroxychloroquine,Methotrexate,Sulfasalazine,D,Methotrexate is a well recognised cause of acute pneumonitis and interstitial lung disease. It is a rare complication of methotrexate therapy but is often fulminant and can be fatal. Azathioprine can lead to bone marrow supresion and infection. Cyclosporin toxicity can cause neurological and visual disturbances.  Hydroxychloroquine can lead to abdominal pain as well as visual disturbances in toxicity. Sulfasalazine can affect liver function tests and caus marrow supression so monitoring is required.

She states this is associated with a productive cough and on occasion the sputum has been blood stained. This is also associated with malaise and severe headache. This has occurred on several occasions over the last few months. Her family owns a farm. As her father died recently she has been helping out on the farm. Bloods reveal an eosinophilia and raised IgE. A CXR shows evidence of pulmonary infiltrates. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Tropical pulmonary eosinophilia,Aspergilloma,Invasive aspergillosis,Wegener's Granulomatosis,Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis,E,"The most likely diagnosis is allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. It is a hypersensitivity reaction to the colonisation of the airways with Aspergillus which is often found in mouldy hay and soil. It is usually affects patient with asthma and cystic fibrosis. Patients have a raised IgE, eosinophils and aspergillus positive. Prednisolone is utilised for treatment. Aspergilloma is normally found in a background of cavitating lung disease such as TB and does not usually present with asthma.  Invasive aspergillosis is observed in immunocompromised.  Wegeners does not usually present with asthma and does not have elevated eosinophils. In tropical pulmonary eosinophilia there is normally weight loss and a travel history to Asia."

female genital system,1,You are involved in the delivery of a baby to a 28 year old patient who has had a prolonged second stage and there are signs of fetal compromise. The cervix is fully dilated. Your consultant suggests preparing for performing a caesarean section. Which of the following statements is true with regard to caesarean section (CS) at full dilatation?,Reduced rates of maternal haemorrhage with CS compared to operative vaginal delivery,Reduced SCBU admissions with CS at full dilatation compared to operative vaginal delivery,Patients undergoing CS at full dilatation are more likely to experience short term urinary incontinence (at 6 weeks) compared to those who undergo operative vaginal delivery,Patients undergoing CS at full dilatation are more likely to experience long term urinary incontinence (at 12 months) compared to those who undergo operative vaginal delivery,Neonatal trauma is less likely with CS at full dilatation compared to operative vaginal delivery,E,"Both minor and significant neonatal trauma is less likely with CS at full dilatation compared to operative vaginal delivery. It is lower still with CS in the first stage of labour. Caesarean section at full dilatation Background60% of caesarean section's (CS) are classed as emergency 4-5% of CS's performed are at full dilatation Increasing prevalencce of CS in second stageRisk of CS at full dilatation vs CS during 1st stage of labourGreater than double the risk of intra-operative trauma increased rates of maternal haemorrhage (4.7-10% vs 2.9%) 1.5 times increased rates of perinatal asphyxiaRisk of CS at full dilatation vs Operative vaginal deliveryMore SCBU admissions with CS at full dilatation (11% v 6%) increased rates of maternal haemorrhage (4.7-10% vs 3%)Benefits of CS at full dilatationLess likely to experience urinary incontinence short term (6 weeks) and long term (12 months) compared to operative vaginal delivery Neonatal trauma (including facial/scalp bruising) less likely with CS than operative vaginal delivery (22% v 9%) Severe neonatal trauma rates very low with CS (0% in CS 1st stage labour, 0.2% CS at full dilatation). More common with operative vaginal delivery.ManagementCurrently insufficient evidence to recommend particular delivery technique or use of medical devices in CS at full dilatation."
female genital system,2,"A 28 year old G3P2 (both vaginal deliveries) presents on the labour ward with PPROM at 34+6 weeks of gestation. She had a cervical suture placed at 17 weeks of gestation following premature labour in her previous pregnancy, which resulted in a normal delivery at 29 weeks of gestation. She shows no signs of clinical infection, the CTG is normal and the fetus is normally grown with normal uterine artery Doppler studies and there is cephalic presentation on ultrasound. What is the most appropriate management step?",Give betamethasone and erythromycin and remove cerclage when there are signs of labour,Remove the suture and consider induction if spontaneous labour does not occur,Give betamethasone and erythromycin and remove cerclage after 48 hours,Perform a category 3 caesarean section,Give betamethasone and atosiban and remove cerclage after 48 hours,B,"(RCOG Cervical Cerclage Guideline) states:""The risk of neonatal and/or maternal sepsis and the minimal benefit of 48 hours of latency in pregnancies with PPROM before 23 and after 34 weeks of gestation, delayed suture removal is unlikely to be advantageous in this situation"" ""In women with PPROM between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation and without evidence of infection orpreterm labour, delayed removal of the cerclage for 48 hours can be considered, as it may result in sufficient latency that a course of prophylactic steroids for fetal lung maturation is completed and/or in utero transfer arranged."""

female genital system,7,A 45­ year­ old woman approaches you in the menopause clinic. Her mother died at the age of 48 from acute myocardial infarction. She wants more information on the use of HRT and other medications to prevent coronary heart disease (CHD). Which of the following statements is correct?,Pharmacotherapy is as good as the combination of lifestyle measures and pharmacotherapy in the prevention of CHD in menopausal diabetic women,New evidence is available regarding the use of lipid lowering agents to prevent CHD in menopausal women,Estrogen may have a protective role in CHD prevention in women aged 50–59 years,Estrogen does not reduce the risk of CHD in women with premature menopause,Aspirin should be taken regularly after the age of 50 years to prevent CHD,C,"Estrogen may have a protective role in CHD prevention in women aged 50–59 years. Women with a premature menopause should take estrogen to reduce the risk of CHD. The role of lipid­lowering agents is uncertain. Aspirin cannot be recommended for primary prevention of CHD, but may protect against stroke. Treating hypertension reduces the risk of CHD. In diabetics, prevention of CHD is based on management of established cardiovascular risk factors through both lifestyle measures and pharmacotherapy. In metabolic syndrome, prevention of CHD is based on management of established cardiovascular risk factors through both lifestyle measures and pharmacotherapy. Stopping smoking, reducing obesity, improving diet and undertaking regular exercise are key lifestyle measures."
female genital system,8,A 21 year old patient presents to the emergency department with sudden onset of severe lower abdominal and pelvic pain. History reveals she missed her last 2 periods.

female genital system,12,"A 62 year old woman with a past history of breast cancer presents with a 5 month history of dyspepsia, early satiety and bloating. A CT scan shows a complex pelvic mass, ascites, omental cake, peritoneal and serosal deposits and multiple parenchymal liver metastases. What is the next most appropriate management step?",Paracentesis and omental biopsy,Referral to an oncologist for palliative chemotherapy,Laparotomy and debulking of tumour,Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy,Mammogram,A,"A diagnostic biopsy is needed before commencing the appropriate treatment. If tissue is unobtainable then diagnostic cytology may suffice. In view of her past history of breast cancer, exclusion of recurrence is essential. In view of the widespread disease and liver metastases, optimal debulking is unlikely and therefore neoadjuvant chemotherapy is preferable."
female genital system,13,The second wave of trophoblast invasion occurs at this gestation,4-6 weeks,12-16 week,22-24 weeks,16-18 weeks,8-12 weeks,D,"DEVELOPMENT OF THE VILLOUS TREE• Primary villous stems become infiltrated by cytotrophoblasts between days 13-21 post-ovulation• Villous stems are subsequently infiltrated by extra-embryonic mysenchyme which differentiates into fetal bloodvessels• The distal parts of the villous stems are not vascularised. Here, cytotrophoblasts proliferate and spread laterally toform a cytotrophoblastic shell, splitting the syncytiotrophoblast into a definitive syncytiotrophoblast on the fetal sideand the peripheral syncytium on the decidual side which degenerates and is replaced by fibrinoid material (Nitabuch'slayer)• Sprouts extend from primary villous stems, initially made up of syncytiotrophoblast and then infiltrated bycytotrophoblast and mesenchyme - these are primary stem villi and the placenta is a true villous structure by day 21of gestation. These villi grow and divide into secondary, tertiary and terminal villi• The villi oriented towards the uterine cavity degenerate between day 21 and the 4th month to form the chorion laeve.The overlying decidua degenerates and the chorion laeve comes in contact with the deciduas of the opposite uterinewall• The rest of the villi form the chorion frondosum which develops into the definitive placenta• Division and modification of the villous tree continues until term. First trimester villi are larger, have a complete layerof cytotrophoblasts and have a loose mysenchymal core which is vascularised towards the end of the first trimester• At term, the villi are smaller, cytotrophoblasts are few in number, the syncytiotrophoblast is irregularly thinned. Fetalvessels are sinusoidal and occupy most of the villous core and lie close to the syncytiotrophoblast, formingvasculusyncytial membranes which maximise materno-fetal transfer.• Sometimes, the syncytiotrophoblast nuclei appear in clusters called syncytial knots - more common in placentas fromIUGR / pre-eclamptic pregnancies• Maternal blood is separated from fetal blood by the syncytiotrophoblast and the fetal capillary endothelium"
female genital system,14,"A 17 year old girl presents to A&E with sudden onset acute pelvic and abdominal pain, fluctuating in intensity, radiating to the thigh and associated with nausea and vomiting. On abdominal examination there is generalised abdominal tenderness, localised guarding and rebound. Vaginal examination elicits cervical excitation and adnexal tenderness. Which criteria is not included in the scoring system for the identification of women with adnexal torsion?",Pain duration >8 hours,Vomiting,Absence of leucorrhoea/metrorrhagia,Unilateral lumbar or abdominal pain,Scan feature of septation,E,"Five criteria are independently associated with adnexal torsion and these allow cases to be placed in to low and high risk groups. Interestingly, while large ovarian cysts (5 cm) had a strong association with torsion, other ultrasound features were not particularly predictive and the highest scoring features were clinical."
female genital system,15,You are asked to review a 25 year old patient who has presented to the emergency department with acute onset pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient is pregnant at 16 weeks gestation. You discuss testing for pulmonary embolism. What is the approximate dose of radiation to breast tissue when performing CTPA (computerised tomography pulmonary angiogram)?,0.1-0.2 mGy,2-5 mGy,10-20 mGy,50-100 mGy,100-150 mGy,C,"CTPA is associated with increased risk of breast cancerWhen considering radiological tests in pregnant patient's it is important to consider radiation risks to the fetus and the patient. Radiation risks to the fetus from CTPA is low (approximately 0.1mGy) compared to the risk of radiation to breast tissue which is considerable at up to 20 mGy. The delivery of 10 mGy of radiation to a woman’s breast has been estimated to increase her lifetime risk of developing breast cancer by 13.6% above her background risk. VTE in Pregnancy Important Stats about VTE in pregnancy10-20% of VTEs are PE's. The majority are DVT Inherited Thrombophilia is present in approximately 40% of women with pregnancy associated VTE Relative risk of VTE in pregnancy is increased 4 to 6 fold compared to non-pregnancy Absolute risk of VTE in pregnancy and the puerperium is 1-2/1000 pregnancies Incidence of Pulmonary Embolism in the UK is 1.3/10,000 maternitiesAbsolute Risk is the risk of developing the disease over a time period. This can be expressed as a fraction or decimal. For example if you have a risk of VTE of 1/1000 pregnancies this may be expressed as 0.001Relative risk is used to compare the risk in two different groups of people e.g. pregnant and non-pregnant women. If the risk of VTE in a healthy non-pregnant women is 2 per 10,000 vs 8-10 per 10,000 in pregnancy then the relative risk is 4 to 5 times (In large US studies figure works out at 4.3) Note Some sources such as SIGN quote relative risk of VTE in pregnancy as high as 10 fold that for non-pregnant patients. This is higher than the RCOG figure and may reflect the risk variation amongst those with other VTE risk factors e.g. age, smoking, obesity. Diagram illustrating Risk Factor stratification for VTE"

female genital system,18,A 30 years old SLE history of baby with congenital heart block. And was found to have anti ro anti la antibodies. Which treatment antenatal will reduce risk in baby of congenital heart block?,Cyclosporine,Prednisolone,Hydroxychloroquine,Mefloquine,Azathioprine,C,"Obstetric management It is important to appreciate that not all pregnancies in women with SLE need to be considered as high risk. Careful identification and stratification should take place to allow women to be managed on an individual basis. Women with Quiescent skin and/or joint disease who have no other underlying organ impairment and who do not require multi-drug therapy or are an incremental increase in their current drug dosage are very different from those with a history of nephritis/hypertension or concurrent APS.Pregnant women with active SLE/lupus nephritis or anti- Ro/La /antiphospholipid antibodies should be considered as a higher risk group and managed in centres with appropriate expericnce.Care should be carried out in a multidisciplinary setting where obstetricians/midwives and physicians/haematologists work closely together to optimise care. It is difficult to recommend precisely how often these women should be reviewed, but those with more active disease need closer monitoring and often require hospital admission. For those individuals with stable disease, do weekly reviews of disease activity and regular assessment of fetal growth, blood pressure and proteinuria are appropriate. For those at particular risk of fetal growth restriction and/or pre-eclampsia because of active disease or previous history, more frequent assessment is indicatedFor those women who are anti-Ro/La positive the fetal heart rate should be monitored and recorded at each visit and fetal echocardiography assessments made at 18- 20 and 28 weeks of gestation.Careful obstetric management involves an awareness of the possibility of lupus flare and an understanding of how this can overlap with normal pregnancy-related changes and with pre-cclampsia."

female genital system,21,A 29‐year‐old woman is receiving subcutaneous Clexane (low‐molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) for the treatment of pulmonary embolism. She is 30 weeks pregnant and develops bruising on her lower arms. The blood pressure in the left lateral position is 125/75 mmHg. What is the most appropriate test for this patient?,Serum potassium,APTT,Factor Xa levels,Platelet count,Serum albumin,D,"This is likely to be heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia (HIT).Long term LMWH treatment has been associated with low platelet counts and this is the test which is likely to provide you with the most information.There are two forms of heparin‐induced thrombocytopenia. Type‐1 occurs within the first couple of days of treatment, and resolves spontaneously. It is a direct effect of heparin on platelet activation.Type 2 HIT is more concerning. It is an immune‐mediated disorder which is caused by antibodies to the heparin‐platelet factor 4 complex. It typically occurs later in treatment, and in its most severe form can be fatal. It should be suspected if the platelet count falls by more than 50% from baseline, even if the total count remains over 150. It can result in arterial and venous thrombosis. Treatment is to stop heparin treatment immediately, Neither warfarin or platelet transfusions should be given.Clexane may cause hyperkalaemia, but this is unlikely to cause bruising.Albumin levels may increase in pregnancy but serum albumin may be low due to haemodilution. Again, this would not usually be associated with bruising.Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is not useful in monitoring LMWH activity, although APTT may be prolonged in high dose Clexane treatment. APTT is increased in intravenous heparin treatment, and is used to adjust doses.Factor Xa levels can be used to monitor efficacy of treatment with low‐molecular weight treatment but the suggestion of bruising here points more to HIT for which Xa levels would not be a useful guide."
female genital system,22,A 22-year-old medical student presents with a request for contraception. Her menstrual cycle is irregular and she complains of acne and hirsutism. Previous investigation has diagnosed polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). She wishes to have a combined oral contraceptive with the best risk profile and most impact on her androgenic symptoms. Which one of the following is the best available option to recommend for her?,Marvelon® (ethinyl estradiol/desogestrel),Yasmin® (ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone),Cilest® (ethinyl estradiol/norgestimate),Microgynon® (ethinyl estradiol/norethisterone),Loestrin® (ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrol),B,"Yasmin® (ethinyl estradiol/drosperinone)From the given list,Yasmin is more beneficial in terms of management of acne and hirsuitism associated with PCOS. Women with PCOS may also be given Marvelon or Mercilon as contraception. Yasmin contains 3 mg of drosperinone, which has some antiandrogenic properties. Dianette is also useful as it contains cyproterone acetate, which is also an antiandrogenic agent. Care must be taken for women with high body mass index."

Consider progesterone only contraception eg injected long-acting progestogens*When heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) coexists with dysmenorrhoea NSAIDs should be preferred to tranexamic acid. Also note NSAIDs and tranexamic are appropriate to use if treatment needed pending investigations.Non-Pharmaceutical Management of MenorrhagiaEndometrial ablation can be considered where bleeding is having a severe impact on a woman's quality of life, and she does not want to conceive in the future. Appropriate to use in patients with small fibroids ( UAE, myomectomy or hysterectomy should be considered in cases of HMB where large fibroids (>3 cm) are present and bleeding is having a severe impact on a woman's quality of life. Hysterectomy should not be used as a first-line treatment solely for HMB. Hysterectomy should be considered only when: other treatment options have failed, are contraindicated or are declined by the woman there is a wish for amenorrhoea the woman (who has been fully informed) requests it the woman no longer wishes to retain her uterus and fertility."

What would you advise them regarding trying to conceive?,Advise avoid trying to conceive (UPSI) for 3 months,Advise avoid trying to conceive (UPSI) for 6 weeks,As they were both asymptomatic they should continue trying to conceive as normal,Advise testing male partner for evidence of Zika infection,Advise testing both parties for evidence of Zika infection,A,"Advise avoid trying to conceive (UPSI) for 3 months If a female wishing to conceive travels to a Zika area then she should avoid trying to conceive until 2 months after returning from that area. If her partner also travels to a Zika area attempts to conceive should be avoided for 3 months. Testing for Zika is only advocated in some scenarios when the woman is already pregnant (see the RCOG article link). It is not recommended for couples wishing to conceive.It is recommended that women should avoid becoming pregnant while travelling in a country or area with risk for of Zika virus transmission.If a couple is considering pregnancy, consistent use of effective contraception is advised to prevent pregnancy and barrier methods (e.g. condom use) are advised during vaginal, anal and oral sex to reduce the risk of conception and the developing fetus being exposed to Zika virus. These measures should be followed whiletravelling and for:3 months after return from an area with risk for Zika virus transmission, or last possible Zika virus exposure, if both partners travelled 3 months after return from an area with risk for of Zika virus transmission, or last possible Zika virus exposure, if just the male partner travelled 2 months after return from an area with risk for Zika virus transmission, or last possible Zika virus exposure if only the female partner travelledNote this advice changed in 2019.

The oral contraceptive pill is known to reduce the risk of sporadic endometrial and ovarian cancer as well as BRCA1/2-associated ovarian cancer. and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system reduces the risk of endometrial cancer in the general population. While there are no conclusive data to support the use of these interventions in women with Lynch syndrome, the prevailingwisdom is that they probably have a beneficial effect on gynecological cancer risk.Taking aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of all cancer types in Lynch syndrome carriers.Aspirin appears to reduce endometrial cancer risk in obese women with Lynch syndrome compared with non-obese women."

female genital system,31,What's the advantage of Joel-Cohen incision?,Less haemorrhagic,Less painful,Poor cosmetic result,Less time-consuming,Decrease Hospital stay,B,"Joel-Cohen incision Professor Joel-Cohen introduced this incision for abdominal hysterectomy in 1954 and obstetricians have since used this widely to perform caesarean sections.This is a straight transverse incision through the skin, 3 cm below the level of the anterior superior iliac spines (higher than the Pfannenstiel incision). The subcutaneous tissues and fascia are opened in the midline and extended laterally with blunt finger dissection. Blunt dissection is used to separate the rectus muscles vertically and then open the peritoneum. Advantages and disadvantages of transverse incisions Advantages:Best cosmetic results Less painful Less interference with postoperative respirations Greater strengthDisadvantages:More time-consuming More haemorrhagic Compromised ability to explore upper abdominal cavity Division of multiple layers of fascia and muscle and nerves, may result in potential spaces with haematoma or seroma"

It presents in the second or third trimester and usually, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is 7-10 times normal with raised alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and bilirubin. Cardiac output and blood volume increase in pregnancy but hepatic blood flow does not. Treatment options include ursodeoxychloric acid, cholestyramine, phenobarbital and vitamin K to treat the coagulopathy. ALP rises in pregnancy but not to this extent. The placenta is the source of the raised ALP. Viral hepatitis is the commonest cause of jaundice in pregnancy but the elevated bile acids make this unlikely in this case."

Cervical carcinoma is most prevalent in countries where surgical and diagnostic resources are limited. As such, unlike the staging of other gynaecological cancers, the FIGO staging of cervical carcinoma is clinical and is not dependent on surgico pathological findings. This strategy therefore allows uniformity of staging for all patients worldwide.The FIGO staging committee nonetheless recognise that clinical staging is limited particularly in the measurement of tumour size, assessment of parametrial and pelvic sidewall invasion, and in the evaluation of lymph node metastases. They therefore recommend the incorporation of cross sectional imaging (MRI/CT) if these resources are available."

What is the cause of this?,Wolffian agenesis,Müllerian agenesis,Crossed fused ectopia,Aneuploidy,PKD-1 gene mutations,B,"This is describing MRKH syndrome which is sometimes known as Müllerian agenesis or uterovaginal agenesis as it is characterized by a failure of the Müllerian duct to develop resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia. Outflow Tract Disorders BackgroundThe urogenital system develops from intermediate mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity and the endoderm of the urogenital sinus. Incidence of congenital anomalies of the genital tract 3% Primarily abnormalities of uterine fusion with septate uteri constituting 90% of cases (uterine abnormalities are considered seperately)MRKH syndrome (uterovaginal agenesis)Incidence approximately 1:5000 female births Genetics not fully understood. Features result of Mullerian agenesis. Patients present as teenagers with primary amenorrhoea due to absent uterus and vagina. There are normal secondary sexual characteristics due to functioning ovaries. 40% have associated renal abnormality. Treatment typically involves psychological support and use of vaginal dilators to dilate the vaginal dimple to allow sexual intercourse. Surgical treatment is also an option.Imperforate HymenThin membrane that occurs at the junction of the sinovaginal bulb with the urogenital sinus Usually perforated during fetal life If remains imperforate then a haematocolpos (blood collection in the vagina proximal to the hymen) may form when menstruation occurs. Treatment involves a cruciate incision to relieve the obstruction. The hymen tissue can be excised or left.Transverse vaginal septumIncidence approximately 1:40,000 Presenting symptoms are typically increasing cyclical abdominal pain and absent menstruation. Haematocolpos and occasionally a small haematometra will form. Treatment involves the excision of the septum and end to end vaginal anastomosis. Vaginal mould for 10 days after surgery and use of vaginal dilators reduce the risk of stenosis. Pregnancy rates are: 100% with lower 1/3 obstruction, 40% with middle 1/3 and 20% with upper third.A=upper third septum, B = middle third septum, C = lower third septumLongitudinal vaginal septumThese fusion defects may occur in the presence of two hemi-uteri and two hemi- cervices. Each cervix fuses with the urogenital sinus to develop into two hemi-vaginas. Presents typically with difficulty inserting tampons, painful sexual intercourse or sometimes found during pregnancy. Can present with a mass if one hemi-vagina is blind ending and accumulates blood. The patient should still appear to have normal menses however as blood will flow via the other hemi-vagina. Excision of the septum is advised for improved chance of conception and to reduce complications with labour."

female genital system,157,A 19 year old white British woman who had a normal delivery 2 years before is referred to the antenatal clinic at 31 weeks of gestation by her community midwife. She was found to be anaemic at 28 weeks of gestation with Hb 90 g/L. She was given a prescription for oral iron and two weeks later a repeat full blood count was as follows: Hb = 89 g/L WCC = 5.0 platelets = 320 MCV = 75 fl MCH = 30 She feels tired but is otherwise well. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?,Haemoglobinopathy screen,Red blood cell transfusion,Check serum ferritin level,Intravenous iron infusion,Check compliance with medication,E,"The most likely diagnosis is iron deficiency anaemia. This is the most common cause of anaemia in pregnancy. The most appropriate course of action is therefore to check compliance with medication. If she states that she has taken the iron and there has been no response, a serum ferritin would be the next step. IV iron should only be given following a confirmed low serum ferritin.There is no indication for blood transfusion at this level of haemoglobin with minimal symptoms and this should be avoided in the antenatal period where possible. A haemoglobinopathy is less likely in a woman of this ethnic origin."

It has traditionally been diagnosed based on findings of a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg (or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg) in the second half of pregnancy with ≥1+ proteinuria on reagent stick testing.NICE advice the following diagnostic criteria for pre-eclampsia:New onset of hypertension (over 140 mmHg systolic or over 90 mmHg diastolic) after 20 weeks of pregnancyPLUS one of the following:Proteinuria (urine protein:creatinine ratio of ≥ 30 mg/mmol or albumin:creatinine ratio of 8 mg/mmol or more, or at least 1 g/litre [2+] on dipstick testing) OR Renal insufficiency (creatinine 90 micromol/litre or more, 1.02 mg/100 ml or more) OR Liver involvement (elevated transaminases [alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase over 40 IU/litre] with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain) OR Neurological complications such as eclampsia, altered mental status, blindness, stroke, clonus, severe headaches or persistent visual scotomata OR Haematological complications such as thrombocytopenia (platelet count below 150,000/microlitre), disseminated intravascular coagulation or haemolysis OR Uteroplacental dysfunction such as fetal growth restriction, abnormal umbilical artery doppler waveform analysis, or stillbirth.Severe hypertensionBlood pressure >160 mmHg systolic (or > 110 mmHg diastolic)Severe pre-eclampsiaPre-eclampsia with severe hypertension that does not respond to treatment or is associated with ongoing or recurring severe headaches, visual scotomata, nausea or vomiting, epigastric pain, oliguria and severe hypertension, as well as progressive deterioration in laboratory blood tests such as rising creatinine or liver transaminases or falling platelet count, or failure of fetal growth or abnormal doppler findings.EclampsiaA convulsive condition associated with pre-eclampsia"
female genital system,185,A downward and inward muscle-splitting incision from the McBurney point that allows extraperitoneal drainage of abscesses is called:,Kustner incision,Mouchel incision,Elliot incision,Rockey–Davis incision,Gridiron incision,E,"The Gridiron incision is a downward and inward incision from the McBurney point. The incision is carried through the skin and subcutaneous fat to the abdominal wall muscles, which is split along the direction of the fibres. The peritoneum may then be reflected away from the abdominal wall inferiorly. This allows extra-peritoneal drainage of abscess, avoiding peritoneal contamination. The Gridiron incision can be performed on the left lower quadrant to drain abscess on the left side of the pelvis and can be varied for appendicectomy in pregnant women. Rockeyidiron incision (or Elliot) is a transverse incision made at the junction of the middle and lower thirds of the line joining the anterior superior iliac spine to the umbilicus. The Keustner incision, sometimes incorrectly referred to as modified Pfannenstiel incision, involves a slightly curved skin incision beginning below the level of the anterior superior iliac spine and extending just below the pubic hairline. The Mouchel incision is a transverse abdominal incision that runs at the upper limit of the pubic hair and is thus lower than the Maylard incision."
female genital system,186,A 26 year old women presents for her 12 week scan. She has been pregnant once before but had a 1st trimester miscarriage. She reports no problems with this pregnancy and has had no vaginal bleeding or spotting. The scan shows no fetal cardiac activity and a small gestational sac. What is the likely diagnosis?,Threatened Miscarriage,Recurrent Miscarriage,Inevitable Miscarriage,Complete Miscarriage,Missed Miscarriage,E,As there has been no bleeding or expulsion of the products of conception this is a missed miscarriage Miscarriage Miscarriage is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation. Ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are not included. First trimester miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks' gestation and accounts for 85% of miscarriagesBleeding after 24 weeks is termed 'antepartum haemorrhage'. Classification of Miscarriage:Complete miscarriage is when all the products of conception have been expelled from the uterus and bleeding has stopped Threatened miscarriage is when uterine bleeding occurs but the viability of the pregnancy is unknown. The diagnosis is often an interim one Inevitable Miscarriage is when cramping pelvic pain and bleeding is associated with a dilated cervix Missed (or delayed) miscarriage occurs when pregnancy has failed (i.e. there is a non-viable fetus within the uterus) but products of conception have not been expelled* Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous consecutive loss of three pregnancies before 24 weeks' gestation*Some definitions state a missed miscarriage is where pregnancy failure has occurred in the absence of bleeding whereas some consider it in the absence of passing products of conception. The result is you may be asked questions where the patient has or has not had vaginal bleeding. If you know the fetus is non-viable from the USS then missed miscarriage is likely to be the correct answer.

Surgical needles have 3 basic components—The attachment point, the body and the point. The body is the section of the needle grasped by the needle holder. The diameter should be as close as possible to that of the suture material being used. The curvature varies depending on the job and is expressed as eighths of a circle. In general the deeper the plane, the more curved the needle should be. Straight is useful for skin, there is also ½ curve (half circle), 3/8 or a J needle that is used to close the rectus sheath after laparoscopy. Some needles are eyed, allowing the surgeon to choose the needle and suture material to suit the job. However, they are rarely used. The point extends from the extreme point of the needle to the maximum diameter of the body. The different points are designed to give the required amount of cutting for different tissues. The needles used in gynaecology surgery include :Blunt point—for blunt dissection and suturing friable tissue. It is also used in patients with blood-borne viruses such as hepatitis B.

Early use of iron replacement is indicated with, if needed, use of intravenous iron.IOCS , together with the use of modern leucocyte depletion filters, has been shown to be effective at removing the common markers of amniotic fluid contamination. However, it will not remove fetal blood cells and therefore adequate anti-D immunisation (as determined by Kleihauer test 30-40 minutes after the procedure) will be required to prevent rhesus immunisation in RhD-negative women."

female genital system,209,"A 27 year old woman was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis 6 months after the birth of her first child. She was started on sulfasalazine and has taken this for several years, with good control of her symptoms. However, she stopped the medication during her subsequent pregnancy and found that her hands and feet were not painful or stiff any more. What would be the best initial treatment for her if she experiences a postpartum flare of her rheumatoid symptoms (e.g. painful, swollen wrists and fingers), such that she is unable to care for her newborn child?",Sulfasalazine,Prednisolone,Paracetamol,Hydroxychloroquine,Diclofenac,B,"This oral steroid has good anti inflammatory properties and if given in an appropriate dose (20 40 mg daily) would give relief of swelling and pain within a few days. A course of prednisolone in tapering doses could be used to good effect whilst other disease modifying drugs (e.g. sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine) are introduced. Note that:Diclofenac would be good for short term pain relief, but does not act as a disease modifier. Prolonged use risks gastrointestinal complications (e.g. gastric ulceration).Paracetamol is not an adequate analgesic or anti inflammatory agent when used alone.Sulfasalazine needs stepwise introduction and could take up to 12 weeks to give noticeable benefit. Although it may be sensible to reintroduce this agent, something else (e.g. oral prednisolone) would be needed to provide quicker relief of symptoms.Hydroxychloroquine, although a good disease modifier, will not give relief of symptoms for up to 12 weeks. Although it may be sensible to introduce this agent, something else (e.g. oral prednisolone) would be needed to provide quicker relief of symptoms."

female genital system,211,Which of the following is true regarding anti-D prophylaxis in pregnancy?,Anti-D immunoglobulin should ideally be administered in the gluteus muscle,Over 50% of significant (> 4 ml) fetomaternal haemorrhages will occur during normal vaginal delivery,Anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered at monthly intervals in Rhesus- negative women with persistent vaginal bleeding after 20 completed weeks of pregnancy,Routine testing to quantify the size of the fetomaternal haemorrhage is not recommended in the UK,Anti-D immunoglobulin should be administered to all Rhesus-negative women who attend with a threatened miscarriage at 11 + 6 weeks,B,"Over 50% of significant (> 4 ml) fetomaternal haemorrhages will occur during normal vaginal delivery Anti-D immunoglobulin is recommended in all Rhesus-negative women with spontaneous miscarriage after 12 weeks. It is also recommended at any gestation in those who have surgical evacuation of the uterus. It should be considered in women undergoing medical intervention. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given to all Rhesus-negative women with ectopic pregnancy regardless of management. Anti-D immunoglobulin should ideally be administered into the deltoid muscle. Administration into the gluteus muscle may penetrate only subcutaneously and therefore lead to delayed absorption. Anti-D immunoglobulin should be given at a minimum of six-week intervals in women with persistent vaginal bleeding after 20 weeks of pregnancy. If the bleed is large, or no cause found, Kleihauer testing can be carried out at two-week intervals to test for size of haemorrhage. Whilst a traumatic delivery is a risk factor for feto-maternal haemorrhage include caesarean section, manual removal of the placenta, stillbirth and fetal death, abdominal trauma during the third trimester, multiple pregnancies (at delivery), and unexplained hydrops fetalis. Approximately 3% of deliveries will have a fetomaternal haemorrhage > 15 ml and so will need additional anti-D immunoglobulin. It is recommended to quantify the size of the fetomaternal haemorrhage in Rhesus-G mothers within two hours of delivery in order to identify the women who will need additional prophylaxis."

COCP COCP SafetyThe UKMEC criteria can be useful for assessing the safety of use of the combined oral contraceptive (COCP or CHC) for an individual. The UKMEC criteria classify risks from 1-4 as summarised below:UKMEC Definition of categoryUKMEC 1 A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the methodUKMEC 2 A condition where the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risksUKMEC 3 A condition where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. The provision of a method requires expert clinical judgement and/or referral to a specialist contraceptive provider, since use of the method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or not acceptableUKMEC 4 A condition which represents an unacceptable health risk if the method is usedIn practice this usually translates to patients who have conditions that fall into UKMEC 1 and 2 categories being safe to prescribe to whereas those with UKMEC 3 or 4 conditions would be deemed unsafe to prescribe to. There are obviously caveats where it may be deemed appropriate for a patient with a UKMEC 3 condition to use the COCP and those with multiple UKMEC 2 conditions being deemed unsuitable.COCP UKMEC 4 conditions:Age ≥ 35 and smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day Systolic BP ≥160mmHg Diastolic BP ≥100mmHg Vascular disease Ischaemic heart disease Stroke History VTE VTE currently being treated with antioagulants Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation Known thrombogenic mutations eg factor V Leiden Complicated valvular heart disease eg history SBE, tetralogy of Fallot, aortic stenosis.

Fetal cardiac activity is noted on ultrasound. What is the likely diagnosis?,Septic Miscarriage,Threatened Miscarriage,Inevitable Miscarriage,Antepartum Haemorrhage,None of the above,D,"Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as bleeding from or in to the genital tract, occurring from 24+0 weeks of pregnancy and prior to the birth of the baby. Miscarriage Miscarriage is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation. Ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are not included. First trimester miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks' gestation and accounts for 85% of miscarriagesBleeding after 24 weeks is termed 'antepartum haemorrhage'. Classification of Miscarriage:Complete miscarriage is when all the products of conception have been expelled from the uterus and bleeding has stopped Threatened miscarriage is when uterine bleeding occurs but the viability of the pregnancy is unknown. The diagnosis is often an interim one Inevitable Miscarriage is when cramping pelvic pain and bleeding is associated with a dilated cervix Missed (or delayed) miscarriage occurs when pregnancy has failed (i.e. there is a non-viable fetus within the uterus) but products of conception have not been expelled* Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous consecutive loss of three pregnancies before 24 weeks' gestation*Some definitions state a missed miscarriage is where pregnancy failure has occurred in the absence of bleeding whereas some consider it in the absence of passing products of conception. The result is you may be asked questions where the patient has or has not had vaginal bleeding. If you know the fetus is non-viable from the USS then missed miscarriage is likely to be the correct answer."

female genital system,274,In placental abruption where does the bleeding originate ?,Decidua basalis,Vasa Previa,Uterine endothelium,Succenturiate lobe,Placental lecunae,A,"Placental abruption occurs when there is premature separation of a normally sited placenta. There are two potential mechanisms for placental abruption acute inflammation and chronic vascular dysfunction. Inflammatory processes are mediated by cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which produce matrix metalloproteinases in trophoblast. The metalloproteinases cause destruction of extracellular matrices and disruption of cell-cell interactions, leading to premature detachment of the placenta.Bleeding begins in the decidua basalis and leads to the separation of the placenta from its attachment to the uterine wall. This separation can be partial and self-limiting or can extend until there is fetal hypoxia and, ultimately, demise."

female genital system,292,"A 26 year old woman had diagnostic laparoscopy as a day case procedure. She went home the same day and returned 4 days later with vomiting, abdominal pain and rigors. What is the most important diagnosis of exclusion?",Urinary tract infection,Wound infection,Small bowel injury,Pelvic inflammatory disease,Bladder injury,C,"Bladder injury could be a potential differential diagnosis, however it is relatively rare that this would happen at laparoscopy as the ancillary ports at the suprapubic region are inserted under direct vision. The bladder is also emptied at the beginning of the procedure.Urinary tract infection rarely presents with vomiting.Small bowel injury can happen especially with multiple attempts at insertion of the Veress needle. It is therefore important not to skip safety checks for Palmer's test and entry pressure when CO2 is introduced.Pelvic inflammatory disease is not a recognised complication following laparoscopy.Wound infection is a possibility but it is usually associated with less severe symptoms and can easily be diagnosed on abdominal inspection and palpation."

female genital system,309,A 25 year old primparous woman is referred to the antenatal clinic for booking at 12 weeks of gestation. The reason for referral is that her father and brother have a history of severe haemophilia A. She wishes to be investigated to see if her baby is affected. What is the most appropriate initial investigation to determine the risk of the baby having haemophilia A?,Factor VIII assay of the woman’s blood to determine her carrier status,Chorionic villus sampling as soon as possible,Quantitative PCR to determine if the woman is a carrier of the haemophilia A gene,Amniocentesis at 16 weeks of gestation,Free fetal DNA in maternal circulation to determine fetal sex,E,"The woman is an obligate carrier and therefore testing her carrier status will not modify the risk of the baby being affected: this is 50% if it is a male fetus a female fetus has a 50% chance of being a carrier. While a factor VIII assay is important for the management of the pregnancy and assessing the woman’s bleeding risk, it will not help to assess the risk of the fetus being affected. Free fetal DNA testing is non invasive and if the fetus is found to be female avoids the need for an invasive test. If the baby is found to be male, a CVS would be the most appropriate test but consideration should be given to the mother’s bleeding risk and need for factor support."

Ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are not included.First trimester miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks' gestation and accounts for 85% of miscarriagesBleeding after 24 weeks is termed 'antepartum haemorrhage'.Classification of Miscarriage:Complete miscarriage is when all the products of conception have been expelled from the uterus and bleeding has stopped Threatened miscarriage is when uterine bleeding occurs but the viability of the pregnancy is unknown. The diagnosis is often an interim one Inevitable Miscarriage is when cramping pelvic pain and bleeding is associated with a dilated cervix Missed (or delayed) miscarriage occurs when pregnancy has failed (i.e. there is a non-viable fetus within the uterus) but products of conception have not been expelled* Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous consecutive loss of three pregnancies before 24 weeks' gestation*Some definitions state a missed miscarriage is where pregnancy failure has occurred in the absence of bleeding whereas some consider it in the absence of passing products of conception. The result is you may be asked questions where the patient has or has not had vaginal bleeding. If you know the fetus is non-viable from the USS then missed miscarriage is likely to be the correct answer.

female genital system,405,You are discussing the role of lymphocytes in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. During the late secretory phase what is the most common type of lymphocyte in the endometrial stroma?,B cells,Plasma cell,T helper cells,uterine natural killer cells,cytotoxic T cells,D,"uterine natural killer cells are the most abundant in the endometrial stroma during the late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and early pregnancy Studies suggest 30% of the lymphocyte population in the endometrial stoma are uterine natural killer cells uNK (in fact some studies quote up to 70% of the population are uNKs). It is believed they play a key role in endometrial preparation and decidualisation. Natural Killer Cells Key PointsUterine natural killer cells (uNK) and peripheral natural killer cells (pNK) have differing adaptations and functions NK cells may differ in their cell surface protein (CD) expressionpNKpNK are described as CD56 dim/CD16+ (few CD56 molecules with low intensity on staining / plentiful CD16 molecules) Primary function of pNK is recognition of foreign antigens CD16 is responsible for cell lysisuNKuNK cells are CD56 bright (high intensity bright on staining)but lack CD16 uNK play important role in decidualisation, implantation and embryo recognition uNK also express killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRS) Binding of HLA-G by the KIR2DL4 receptor triggers inflammatory and angiogenic cytokinesRole of uNK in pregnancyEndometrial changes to become decidua driven by cytokines and angiogenic factors uNK bind to and proliferate in the presence of these cytokines and induce interferon-gamma (IFNG) uNK are predominant leucocyte in late secretory phase of the menstrual cycle uNK account for 30% of endometrial stroma uNK cells surround uterine spiral arteries As the syncytiotrophoblast invades the endometrial stroma during implantation IFNG (via NO) promotes vasodilatation and inhibits smooth muscle proliferation Control of synctiotrophoblast invasion is thought to occur due to interactions of the uNK cells. HLA-G binds to KIR2DL4 on uNK cells which blocks lytic activity whilst promoting angiogenesis. HLA-E binding to CD94/NKG receptors is also thought to inhibit synctiotrophoblast invasionAreas of future researchGiven role of uNK in decidualisation and implantation postulated uNK imbalance may be possible cause recurrent miscarriage or implantation failure"

Outflow Tract Disorders BackgroundThe urogenital system develops from intermediate mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity and the endoderm of the urogenital sinus. Incidence of congenital anomalies of the genital tract 3% Primarily abnormalities of uterine fusion with septate uteri constituting 90% of cases (uterine abnormalities are considered seperately)MRKH syndrome (uterovaginal agenesis)Incidence approximately 1:5000 female births Genetics not fully understood. Features result of Mullerian agenesis. Patients present as teenagers with primary amenorrhoea due to absent uterus and vagina. There are normal secondary sexual characteristics due to functioning ovaries. 40% have associated renal abnormality. Treatment typically involves psychological support and use of vaginal dilators to dilate the vaginal dimple to allow sexual intercourse. Surgical treatment is also an option.Imperforate HymenThin membrane that occurs at the junction of the sinovaginal bulb with the urogenital sinus Usually perforated during fetal life If remains imperforate then a haematocolpos (blood collection in the vagina proximal to the hymen) may form when menstruation occurs. Treatment involves a cruciate incision to relieve the obstruction. The hymen tissue can be excised or left.Transverse vaginal septumIncidence approximately 1:40,000 Presenting symptoms are typically increasing cyclical abdominal pain and absent menstruation. Haematocolpos and occasionally a small haematometra will form. Treatment involves the excision of the septum and end to end vaginal anastomosis. Vaginal mould for 10 days after surgery and use of vaginal dilators reduce the risk of stenosis. Pregnancy rates are: 100% with lower 1/3 obstruction, 40% with middle 1/3 and 20% with upper third.A=upper third septum, B = middle third septum, C = lower third septumLongitudinal vaginal septumThese fusion defects may occur in the presence of two hemi-uteri and two hemi- cervices. Each cervix fuses with the urogenital sinus to develop into two hemi-vaginas. Presents typically with difficulty inserting tampons, painful sexual intercourse or sometimes found during pregnancy. Can present with a mass if one hemi-vagina is blind ending and accumulates blood. The patient should still appear to have normal menses however as blood will flow via the other hemi-vagina. Excision of the septum is advised for improved chance of conception and to reduce complications with labour."

female genital system,417,An 18 year old patient comes to see you in clinic. Her BMI is 25.0 and her BP is 122/80. She is a non-smoker and there is no personal or family history of VTE or migraine. She would like to start the pill for her acne. She has used topical Zineryt in the past but still has moderate acne. What is the most appropriate option?,Norimin (Ethinylestradiol/Norethisterone),Cerazette (Desogestrel),Dianette (Co-cyprindiol),Marvelon (Ethinylestradiol/Desogestrel),Yasmin (ethinylestradiol / drosperinone),D,"Marvelon (Ethinylestradiol/Desogestrel)The question isn't as straight forward as it seems. Considerations to make are that the patient hasn't trialled oral antibacterials or standard COCPs and has moderate acne. NICE CKS guidance advises consider prescribing a standard COCP in moderate acne. Norethisterone has androgenic properties so preparations containing this should be avoided. Cerazette is a POP so shouldn't be used. Although there are 2 options here that at first glance appear sensible i.e. Dianette & Yasmin you should consider their licences. Dianette's licence is for use in severe acne that has failed to respond to oral antibacterials and for moderately severe hirsutism. Neither of those apply here.Yasmin contains drosperinone which has antiandrogenic effects so would also be a reasonable choice but again it is not licensed for acne. The pragmatic approach would be to use a standard COCP initially with their lower risk of VTE reserving Dianette or Yasmin for those with treatment failure. If hirsutism is present then Dianette or Yasmin would be the obvious 1st line choices. COCP COCP SafetyThe UKMEC criteria can be useful for assessing the safety of use of the combined oral contraceptive (COCP or CHC) for an individual. The UKMEC criteria classify risks from 1-4 as summarised below:UKMEC Definition of categoryUKMEC 1 A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the methodUKMEC 2 A condition where the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risksUKMEC 3 A condition where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. The provision of a method requires expert clinical judgement and/or referral to a specialist contraceptive provider, since use of the method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or not acceptableUKMEC 4 A condition which represents an unacceptable health risk if the method is usedIn practice this usually translates to patients who have conditions that fall into UKMEC 1 and 2 categories being safe to prescribe to whereas those with UKMEC 3 or 4 conditions would be deemed unsafe to prescribe to. There are obviously caveats where it may be deemed appropriate for a patient with a UKMEC 3 condition to use the COCP and those with multiple UKMEC 2 conditions being deemed unsuitable. COCP UKMEC 4 conditions:Age ≥ 35 and smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day Systolic BP ≥160mmHg Diastolic BP ≥100mmHg Vascular disease Ischaemic heart disease Stroke History VTE VTE currently being treated with antioagulants Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation Known thrombogenic mutations eg factor V Leiden Complicated valvular heart disease eg history SBE, tetralogy of Fallot, aortic stenosis.

female genital system,418,A 33 year old woman has been referred to clinic. She has been diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and advises you she wishes to conceive. Which of the following would be the most appropriate to use throughout pregnancy?,Rituximab,Infliximab,Etanercept,Certolizumab,Adalimumab,D,Certolizumab is considered the pregnancy friendly anti-TNF drug as it is safe throughout all trimesters Certolizumab is sometimes referred to as the pregnancy friendly biologic as it is not actively transported across the placenta like other biologics and thus doesn't accumulate to the same extent as transport is reliant on slow diffusion. It is safe in all trimesters of pregnancy. Note all the anti-TNF drugs above are safe in breastfeeding.Rituximab is a mono-clonal antibody that depletes B-cells. It is advised this is discontinued 6 months before conceiving so is the least appropriate choice here. Biologics in pregnancy (TNF) BackgroundBiological agents refer to biological molecules that are used primarily to treat auto-immune conditions They are also sometimes referred to as cytokine modulatorsStarting biologicsAware patients immune system will be suppressed and increasing susceptibility to infection Vaccines need to be up to date prior to commencing Live vaccines contraindicated once on biologics (live vaccines shouldn't be given if pregnant) Should be screened for latent TB infection and treated prior to starting Consider biologics may increase risk of some cancers.

female genital system,430,"A 26 year old primigravida at 36/40 weeks of gestation with DCDA twins has twin 1 in a cephalic and twin 2 in breech position. The pregnancy has been uncomplicated and both twins are on the 50th centile for growth. The CTG has been normal throughout labour. Twin 1 is delivered uneventfully, following which twin 2 becomes transverse. Contractions diminish and it has now been 45 minutes since delivery of twin 1. What is the optimal management in this scenario?",Commence syntocinon,Caesarean section,Rupture of membranes and commence syntocinon,Internal podalic version and breech extraction,Rupture of membranes,D,This is based on:Successful vaginal delivery is less likely with external version compared with breech extractionMaternal morbidity is higher with caesarean section with no impact on neonatal morbidity compared with vaginal birth (Rabinovici et al 1987)Rupture of membranes is inappropriate due to the risk of cord prolapse with a transverse presentationBreech extraction is preferred over external cephalic version therefore the answer is internal podalic version
female genital system,431,In pregnancy by what percentage does the total blood volume increase near term?,20%,50%,80%,100%,150%,B,"A greater increase in intravascular volume compared to red cell mass results in physiological anaemia of pregnancy.Near term, the total blood volume increases to approximately 50% above non‐pregnant values. This acts to provide some reserve against the normal blood loss during parturition ‐approximately 300 to 500 mL for vaginal delivery, 600 to 1000 mL for caesarean delivery ‐ and peripartum haemorrhage.Following delivery, as much as 500 mL of blood sequestered in the uteroplacental unit is autotransfused to the maternal circulation, this minimises adverse circulatory effects from the blood loss at delivery."

female genital system,456,Renal cell carcinoma is associated with which type of metastasis?,Lymphatic,Transcoelomic,Haematogenous,Implantation,Transplantation,C,Most carcinomas spread primarily via lymphatic invasion. Renal cell is the exception spreading via the bloodstream. Metastasis Metastasis is the spread of disease from one organ to another site in the body. It is a property of most cancers (Very rare in BCC and glioma). They are a number of routes of spread and some cancers spread preferentially via certain routes:LymphaticCarcinomaHaematogenousSarcoma Renal cell carcinoma ChoriocarcinomaTranscoelomicOvarianImplantation/transplantationMovement of malignant cells during biopsy/surgery/procedureExam TipIn the exam it is most likely you will asked about malignancies that spread via non-lymphatic routes i.e. transcoelomic spread in ovarian cancer or haematogenous spread of choriocarcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma is unusual for carcinoma in that it spreads via the bloodstream rather than lymphatics so again may be something examiners pick to test you.

female genital system,504,"Regarding serological tests for syphilis , prozone phenomenon is an example of which of the following ?",False positive,False negative,True positive,True negative,None of the above,B,"False-negative syphilis serologyTreponemal screening tests are negative before a chancre develops and may be for up to two weeks afterwards. A false-negative RPR , VDRL test may occur secondary or early latent syphilis due to the prozone pehenomenon when testing undiluted serum. In such cases negative tests on undiluted sera should be repeated on diluted sera. Prozone phenomenon is a false negative response resulting from high antibody titer which interferes with formation of antigen- antibody lattice, necessary to visualize a positive flocculation test. The prozone phenomenon is attaining importance because of increasing prevalence of Acquired immune deficiency syndrome. So one needs to be familiar with the occurrence of prozone phenomenon. This may be more likely to occur in HIV-infected individuals. The RPR, VDRL and IgM may be negative in late syphilis.False-positive syphilis serologyOccasional false-positive results may occur with any of the serological tests tor syphilis. In general. false-positive reactivity is more likely in autoimmune disease, older age and injecting drug use. In the absence of symptoms of syphilis. a history of syphilis or a concomitant positive anti-treponemal IgM: transient or persistent reactivity in a single treponemal antigen test should be considered to be a false-positive result.Primary screening tests- Treponemal EIA CLIA (preferably a test that detects both IgG and IgM or TPPA, which is preferred to TPHA.- Request an anti-treponemal IgM test if primary syphilis is suspected. The chemical utility of the IgM test is limited by its sub-optimal sensitivity and it should not be used to stage disease or decide the duration of treatment required.- Rapid treponemal tests might be useful is some out-reach settings. provided positive results are confirmed by laboratory tests.Confirmatory tests- Positive screening tests should be confirmed with a different treponemal test.- An IgG immunoblot is recommended as a supplementary confirmatory test when the standard confirmatory test does not confirm the positive screening test result. Tests for assessing serological activity of syphilis- A quantitative RPR, VDRL should be performed when treponemal tests indicate syphilis as this helps stage the infection and indicates the need for treatment in some cases. tor example. where the patient has been previously treated and may have been re-infected.- An initial RPR VDRL titre of >16 usually indicates active disease and the need for treatment. although serology must be interpreted in the height of the treatment history and clinical findings.- A RPR VDRL titre of 16 or less does not exclude active infection. particularly in a patient with clinical signs suggestive of syphilis or where adequate treatment of syphilis is not documented.- A negative anti-treponemal IgM test does not exclude active infection, particularly in late disease.Tests for monitoring the effect of treatment- A quantitative RPR VDRL test is recommended for monitoring the serological response to treatment and should be performed on a specimen taken on the day that treatment s started as this provides an accurate baseline for monitoring response to treatment."

Which of the following would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient?,Add fluoxetine,Add norethisterone,Add testosterone patch,Counselling andamp; lifestyle changes,Optimise oestrogen replacement,E,"Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is well recognised in post-menopausal females as well as in patients following ovarian failure. Counselling and lifestyle changes are generally only successful in isolation if the primary cause is relationship issues or stress. Depression may need treatment if it is the primary cause, but some antidepressants have been associated with loss of libido and therefore would not be the first cause in this case. If a woman's hormones are thought to be inadequate, as in this case, then hormone replacement therapy (HRT) should be optimised but with the same caveats and precautions as at any other time. The value of androgen patches for treating hormone-deficient women is controversial and may have detrimental effects on the liver and cholesterol. An opinion from secondary care would probably be wise. Progestogens are not required in hysterectomised subjects and may cause a deterioration in symptoms.  "

Conversely, chronic hepatitis does not appear to have an adverse effect on the course of pregnancy or the birth weight of the newborn infant. The role of spontaneous abortion is approximately the same as in the general population. The overall rate of mother-to-child transmission for HCV is 3–5 % if the mother is known to be anti-HCV positive. Co-infection with human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) increases the rate of mother-to-child transmission up to 19.4 %. Numerous risk factors for vertical transmission have been studied. In general, high viral load defi ned as at least 2.5 × 106 viral RNA copies/mL, HIV co-infection and invasive procedures are the most important factors. (Please note: HCV is a RNA virus, not DNA.) Both interferon and ribavirin are contraindicated during pregnancy. Viral clearance prior to pregnancy increases the likelihood that a woman remains non-viremic in pregnancy with a consequent reduced risk of vertical transmission."

The fetal body is raisedupward in an arc completing deliveryIn up to 20% of vaginal breech deliveries, obstetric forceps may be required to deliver the fetal head. Forceps are indicated for the management of vaginal breech delivery if the MSV manoeuvre is unsuccessful. If available, Piper obstetric forceps should be used. Piper obstetric forceps are specifically designed for vaginal breech delivery. These are long forceps and have an axis traction curve. If these are not available then Kiellands forceps should be the instrument of choice. Alternatively any other type of mid cavity obstetric forceps can be used. Wrigley's obstetric forceps should not be used for vaginal breech delivery."
female genital system,607,A patient who is 28 weeks pregnant is seen for a follow up scan due to previously diagnosed monochorionic twin pregnancy (MCDA). So far there have been no complications in her pregnancy. What would you advise regarding delivery?,Planned for 38 weeks if hasn't delivered spontaneously,Planned for 36-37 weeks of gestation,Planned for 34-35 weeks of gestation,Caesarian section at 38 weeks,Caesarian section at 36 weeks,B,Delivery should be planned for 36-37 weeks unless complications arise that would make an earlier delivery desirable.Vaginal birth of monochorionic twins is appropriate unless other indications for caesarean section arise e.g. one twin breech or prior c-section. Monochorionic Twin Pregnancy Monochorionic twin pregnancy is one where both babies are supplied by a single shared placenta. In the UK 1 in 3 twin pregnancies are monochorionic.Twin to twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) can arise in monochorionic twin pregnancy which can be fatal to the co-twin.
female genital system,608,"The Smead–Jones closure is a mass closure technique of the anterior abdominal wall using a far–far, near–near approach. The closure is performed using a delayed absorbable suture to include all the abdominal wall structures on the far–far portion and only the anterior fascia on the near–near portion. This allows good healing without intervening fat or muscle. Which of the following best describes the rate of fascial dehiscence with running mass closure of the abdomen?",24%.,14%.,4%.,0.4%.,0.04%.,D,The fascial dehiscence rate with running mass closure of the abdomen is 0.4%

female genital system,610,You are discussing contraception with a 29 year old woman. She has expressed an interest in the copper intrauterine device (IUCD). She wants to know how effective it is at preventing pregnancy? How many women become pregnant within the first year of using an IUCD?,1 per 1000,3 per 1000,8 per 1000,3 per 1000,1 per 1000,C,The IUCD is very effective. The stats show 0.6% or 6 per 1000 women will become pregnant with 'perfect use' whilst 0.8% or 8 per 1000 women will become pregnant with 'typical use' within the first year. IUCD Mechanism of ActionPrimary mode of action of copper intrauterine devices (IUD/IUCD/Cu-IUD) is via the toxic effect of copper on the ovum and sperm preventing fertilization. Secondary mechanism is via alterations in the copper content of cervical mucus which may inhibit penetration by sperm. Inflammatory reactions within the endometrium may also prevent implantation should the ovum be fertilised.Effectiveness1-2 per 100 women using IUCD as contraception will become pregnant over 5 years of use. 0.6-0.8% of women will conceive within first year of useSide Effects/RisksHeavy menstrual bleeding Risk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)*Risk of ectopic pregnancy is not increased by IUCD compared to no contraception. In fact risk of ectopic is decreased by IUCD. Although the IUCD doesn't cause ectopic pregnancies it is less effective at preventing ectopic pregnancy than intrauterine pregnancy. The result is that a higher proportion of pregnancies in patients with IUCD are ectopic compared to women using no contraception.

female genital system,616,A 29 year old is seen on EPU and its confirmed her pregnancy has miscarried at 9 weeks. This is her second first trimester miscarriage. What is the most likely cause?,Placental insuffciency,Abormal uterine anatomy,Fetal chromosome abnormality,Infection,Antiphospholipid syndrome,C,Fetal Aneuploidy i.e. the presence of an abnormal number of chromosomes in a cell is the leading cause of 1st trimester miscarriage.Antiphospholipid syndrome is the most important treatable cause of recurrent miscarriage. Miscarriage Miscarriage is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation. Ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are not included.First trimester miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks' gestation and accounts for 85% of miscarriagesBleeding after 24 weeks is termed 'antepartum haemorrhage'.Classification of Miscarriage:Complete miscarriage is when all the products of conception have been expelled from the uterus and bleeding has stopped Threatened miscarriage is when uterine bleeding occurs but the viability of the pregnancy is unknown. The diagnosis is often an interim one Inevitable Miscarriage is when cramping pelvic pain and bleeding is associated with a dilated cervix Missed (or delayed) miscarriage occurs when pregnancy has failed (i.e. there is a non-viable fetus within the uterus) but products of conception have not been expelled* Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous consecutive loss of three pregnancies before 24 weeks' gestation*Some definitions state a missed miscarriage is where pregnancy failure has occurred in the absence of bleeding whereas some consider it in the absence of passing products of conception. The result is you may be asked questions where the patient has or has not had vaginal bleeding. If you know the fetus is non-viable from the USS then missed miscarriage is likely to be the correct answer.

female genital system,619,A woman returns to the antenatal clinic following her mid trimester anomaly scan. On the scan it states that there is an abdominal wall defect present. There is herniation of the small bowel to the right of the cord insertion. The bowel does not appear to be membrane covered and is free floating in the liquor. Fetal biometry appears normal but liquor is subjectively reduced. The rest of the fetal anatomy appears normal. What is the most appropriate course of action?,The findings are consistent with exomphalos and likely to be associated with chromosomal abnormalities offer a termination of pregnancy,The findings are consistent with physiological herniation of the bowel that resolves in the vast majority of cases arrange a follow up ultrasound scan at 28 weeks,The findings are likely associated with a chromosomal abnormality arrange an amniocentesis for the woman,The findings are consistent with gastroschisis offer to arrange serial growth scans and review at the tertiary fetal medicine unit to discuss the prognosis with the neonatal surgeons,The findings are consistent with a limb body wall defect offer termination of pregnancy,D,Induction of labour is offered at 37 weeks.The ultrasound findings are suggestive of gastroschisis. This has a higher prevalence amongst younger women and is not normally associated with chromosomal abnormalities. The bowel loops are not membrane covered and at risk of dilatation and thickening. There is often associated growth restriction and oligohydramnios. Serial growth scans should be arranged.An appointment should be made to see the neonatal surgeons to discuss the postnatal management. Induction of labour should be offered at 37 weeks in a tertiary unit with access to neonatal surgery.

Grade II: marginal praevia: placental tissue reaches the margin of the internal cervical os, but does not cover it Grade III: partial praevia: placenta partially covers the internal cervical os Grade IV: complete praevia: placenta completely covers the internal cervical osNOTE Sometimes grades I & II termed 'minor' praevia whilst III and IV termed 'major' praevia.AIUM ClassificationThe 2018 greentop guidelines noted the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) classification is potentially superior to the above gradings. Candidates should be aware of both as the RCOG has not explicitly advised use of the old grades be discontinued and questions may still emerge on the old gradings.Under the new system the following terms are used:Placenta praevia: is used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os. Low lying placenta: For pregnancies greater than 16 weeks of gestation when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os. Normal: Placental edge is 20 mm or more from the internal os on TAS or TVS"

female genital system,684,You are reviewing a pregnant woman in the obstetric endocrine clinic along with an endocrinologist. She is currently 7 weeks pregnant in her first pregnancy. She was diagnosed with Graves' disease 4 years ago and was on carbimazole. She was not compliant with the medication and had radioiodine therapy 8 months ago for uncontrolled hyperthyroidism. She did not attend clinic for follow up and is currently not on treatment. She feels well in herself apart from occasional palpitations. Examination reveals mild tachycardia and moderate goitre. Recent TFT results showed TSH,Commence carbimazole or propylthiouracil along with levothyroxine,Commence propylthiouracil and change to carbimazole in the second trimester,Check thyroid stimulating antibodies (TRAb) levels before commencing antithyroid medication,Offer termination of pregnancy as had radioiodine therapy only 8 months ago,Commence carbimazole and change to propylthiouracil in the second trimester,B,"Treatment options include carbimazole (CBZ), methiamazole (MMI, the active part of CBZ) or propylthiouracil (PTU), which block thyroid hormone synthesis and reduce the titre of TSH receptor antibodies. All of these cross the placenta, but PTU less so than CBZ and MMI. There is a possible rare risk of fetal aplasia cutis (reversible) or an embryopathy (choanal atresia, trachea oesophagael fistula, facial dymorphism and cognitive development delay) with CBZ or MMI. PTU does not cause fetal anomaly but is a rare, proven cause of maternal liver damage, which has resulted in many worldwide cases of death or liver transplant requirements. There is a small chance of maternal agranulocytosis with both PTU and CBZ. There is indecision across the literature as to the best drug to use for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. The current general consensus, however, is to use PTU in the first trimester and then change to CBZ or MMI for the second and third trimesters. Newly diagnosed thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy should be treated aggressively with high doses of PTU or CBZ for 4–6 weeks followed by gradual reduction to maintenance dose.No role for block and replace regimens in the management of thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy.TRAb should be measured at 20–24 weeks of gestation in woman with Graves' disease to identify the fetuses/babies at risk of fetal/neonatal thyrotoxicosis.Pregnancy should be avoided for at least 4 months after radioiodine therapy as there is a small theoretical risk of chromosomal damage and genetic abnormalities."

Her observations and U&Es are as follows:",Antiembolic stockings,IV Cyclizine 50mg,IV Pabrinex 10ml in 100ml saline,IV Hartmann's 1L over 2 hours,IV Calcium Gluconate 10mg in 10ml,E,"There is no role for calcium gluconate here. In addition to the treatments listed LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin) could be considered depending on the patients mobility and state of dehydration. Hyperemesis Gravidarum BackgroundNausea and vomiting experienced in 80% of pregnancies Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is an extreme form of nausea and vomiting which affects around 1.5% of women. Caused by high levels HCG Definitions vary but most consider it to be defined by severe nausea and vomiting associated with weight loss greater than 5% of pre-pregnancy weight with metabolic disturbance (typically dehydration and/or ketosis). HG usually starts before week 12 (definition require symptoms start pre week 22) but may continue throughout pregnancyPotential ComplicationsAlkalosis (more typical) or Acidosis* DVT Wernicke's Electrolyte imbalance eg hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia and ketosis Oesophageal rupture SGA baby*HG typically causes alkalosis due to H+ ion loss due to vomiting. Whilst alkalosis is more typical acidosis can also occur as a result of ketone production in response to depletion of glucose stores."

OHSS Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) Key PointsOHSS is a condition which can effect women taking fertility medication where there is an excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin therapy resulting in ovarian enlargement. There isn't a widely accepted classification system. Traditionally OHSS has been graded as mild, moderate or severe. The proposed RCOG system is shown below Overstimulated ovaries enlarge and release proinflammatry mediators into the bloodstream. The resulting increased vascular permeability leads to fluid loss from the intravascular compartment and is the reason patients can develop ascites and effusions. In severe OHSS significant hypovolaemia can ensue. Changes in fluid distribution and vascular permeability lead to a host of other biochemical disturbances that can result in prothombotic tendency (VTE), electrolyte disturbance inc hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, nausea and tissue oedema.OHSSTrue incidence unknown With conventional IVF estimates mild OHSS with 1 in 3 cycles.

female genital system,709,You are discussing contraception with a 29 year old woman. She has expressed an interest in the copper intrauterine device (IUCD). Which of the following statements regarding IUCD contraception is true?,Associated with an increased risk of endometrial cancer,Associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer,Patients should be advised they will be effective from 48 hours post insertion and avoid UPSI or use barrier methods for first 48 hours post insertion,Associated with an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy,There are no drugs that are known to affect IUCD efficacy,E,IUCD's may be associated with a reduced risk of endometrial and cervical cancer.The IUCD is effective immediately after insertion and can be used for emergency contraceptionAmong women with IUCDs who become pregnant there is a higher proportion of pregnancies that are ectopic however the IUCD reduces the rate/risk of ectopic pregnancy compared to patients using no contraception.There are no drug interactions with the IUCD and no drugs that are known to affect IUCD efficacy. IUCD Mechanism of ActionPrimary mode of action of copper intrauterine devices (IUD/IUCD/Cu-IUD) is via the toxic effect of copper on the ovum and sperm preventing fertilization. Secondary mechanism is via alterations in the copper content of cervical mucus which may inhibit penetration by sperm. Inflammatory reactions within the endometrium may also prevent implantation should the ovum be fertilised.Effectiveness1-2 per 100 women using IUCD as contraception will become pregnant over 5 years of use. 0.6-0.8% of women will conceive within first year of useSide Effects/RisksHeavy menstrual bleeding Risk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)*Risk of ectopic pregnancy is not increased by IUCD compared to no contraception. In fact risk of ectopic is decreased by IUCD. Although the IUCD doesn't cause ectopic pregnancies it is less effective at preventing ectopic pregnancy than intrauterine pregnancy. The result is that a higher proportion of pregnancies in patients with IUCD are ectopic compared to women using no contraception.

Clinically, granuloma inguinale manifests with one or more genital nodules that develop into red, painless ulcers. The regional lymph nodes are typically spared. Diagnosis of granuloma inguinale is based primarily on clinical findings and is confirmed through detection of Donovan bodies (intracytoplasmic macrophages containing bacteria) in ulcer smears or biopsies. Management focuses on antibiotic treatment with azithromycin, which is continued until the ulcers have completely healed. Surgical treatment may be necessary for patients who develop genital pseudo-elephantiasis, a complication seen most commonly in women. In these cases, ulcers or scar tissue obstruct lymph drainage and lead to severe localized edema."

female genital system,772,Which of the following statements is true regarding smoking in pregnancy?,The newborn baby may require adjustments in drug dosages because of it,Smoking reduces maturation of the fetal lung,Maternal smoking may adversely affect testicular function in male children,Dysmorphic facies is a recognised complication,The reduction in birth weight is related to the number of cigarettes smoked per day,E,"Smoking reduces birth weight which may be of critical importance if the baby is born pre‐term.On average, the babies of smokers weigh 170 g less than non‐smokers, but the reduction in birth weight is related to the number of cigarettes smoked per day.Smoking is also associated with an increased risk of miscarriage and still birth. The infant has a greater risk of sudden infant death syndrome.There is some evidence that maternal smoking may adversely affect ovarian function in female children.No dysmorphic syndrome has yet been described.Maternal smoking has been shown to increase lung maturity, possibily by enhancing the production or secretion of cortisol. This makes neonates less likely to develop respiratory distress syndrome, but as lung maturation is often abnormal babies may have reduced lung function and increased rates of other respiratory illnesses."
female genital system,773,What is the mode of action of Mefenamic acid?,Activates Antithrombin III,Inhibits Plasminogen Activation,Inhibits Prostaglandin Synthesis,Inhibits fibrin,Inactivates factor Xa,C,"Mefenamic acid works by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. It reduces menstrual blood loss by approx 25%. It is generally better tolerated than tranexamic acid. Tranexamic acid is a plasminogen-activator inhibitor. It inhibits the dissolution of thrombosis (haemostatic fibrin) by plasmin. It can reduce flow by up to 50%. Activation of Antithrombin III and inactivation of factor Xa is the primary mechanism of action of Heparin. Menorrhagia Pharmaceutical Treatment of MenorrhagiaIf pharmaceutical treatment is appropriate NICE advise treatments should be considered in the following order:1. levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) provided at least 12 months use is anticipated 2. tranexamic acid or NSAIDs* or combined oral contraceptives (COCs) or cyclical oral progestogens 3. Consider progesterone only contraception eg injected long-acting progestogens*When heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) coexists with dysmenorrhoea NSAIDs should be preferred to tranexamic acid. Also note NSAIDs and tranexamic are appropriate to use if treatment needed pending investigations.Non-Pharmaceutical Management of MenorrhagiaEndometrial ablation can be considered where bleeding is having a severe impact on a woman's quality of life, and she does not want to conceive in the future. Appropriate to use in patients with small fibroids ( UAE, myomectomy or hysterectomy should be considered in cases of HMB where large fibroids (>3 cm) are present and bleeding is having a severe impact on a woman's quality of life. Hysterectomy should not be used as a first-line treatment solely for HMB. Hysterectomy should be considered only when: other treatment options have failed, are contraindicated or are declined by the woman there is a wish for amenorrhoea the woman (who has been fully informed) requests it the woman no longer wishes to retain her uterus and fertility."

female genital system,776,A patient who underwent an abdominal hysterectomy a few days ago complains of numbness over the skin over the anterior aspect of the upper thigh. This could be attributed to neuropathy of the:,Peroneal nerve,Sciatic nerve,Obturator nerve,Pudendal nerve,Femoral nerve,E,"Self-retaining abdominal retractors can cause a femoral neuropathy either by direct pressure on the nerve or exaggerated extension of the retractor blades. The diagnosis is made some days after the surgery with a complaint of numbness over the skin on the anterior surface of the upper thigh. Specific action is not indicated, as there are no serious sequelae and symptoms will usually spontaneously resolve over a few months. Obturator nerve injury causes numbness in the inner thigh and difficulty in adduction of hip joint causing gait difficulties and posture instability.

Such patients are at further risk if the operating time exceeds 4 h. A large number of iatrogenic lumbosacral nerve injuries during gynaecological surgery can be attributed to the incorrect positioning of self-retaining retractor blades. The gold standard of correct positioning is for the self-retractor blades to cradle the rectus muscle without compressing the psoas muscle underneath. When positioning the retractors, the surgeon must check visually and by direct palpation that the psoas muscle is not entrapped between the blades and the pelvic side wall."

female genital system,805,A 32 year old primiparous woman had a mitral valvotomy 1 year ago with significant persisting pulmonary hypertension on antenatal investigations. She is undergoing an elective caesarean section at 39 weeks of gestation for breech presentation. What is the most appropriate anaesthetic option for her?,Epidural anaesthesia,Combined low dose spinal epidural,Spinal anaesthesia,General anaesthesia,All options are suitable,B,"Mitral stenosis causes pulmonary hypertension and an enlarged right atrium with increased risk of atrial fibrillation. An echocardiogram is required in this woman's care to determine the degree of residual pulmonary hypertension and if any subsequent mitral regurgitation exists. If there is no residual pulmonary hypertension all anaesthetic options are acceptable. If pulmonary hypertension exists you need to maintain good right heart filling pressures and hypotension should be avoided.General anaesthesia is more difficult in pregnancy because of laryngealoedema, aspiration pneumonia and changes in the circulation. It also causes a rise in CO2 which is dangerous for someone with pulmonaryhypertension. Low dose spinal anaesthesia reduces the risk of sudden changes in the cardiovascular haemodynamics compared to routine spinal anaesthesia."

Treatment should consist of:1. Rehydration with electrolyte correction 2. Antiemetics 3. Nutrition/vitamin replacement 4. ThromboprophylaxisThis patient is under 20. Metoclopramide should not be given to under 20's due to the risk of oculogyric crisis. Stemetil or cyclizine are 1st line. Patients with HG are at risk of vitamin B1 deficiency and subsequent Wernicke's encephalopathy. Dextrose solutions can exacerbate Wernicke's so are not appropriate here. In addition the patient is mildly hyponatraemic. Hartmann's or Saline solution with potassium supplementation would be appropriate but this is not listed. Some hospitals use aggressive regimes with 2L given over 4 hrs but the patients condition and response to initial fluid should be closely monitored.Pyridoxine (B6) supplementation is not recommended by NICE and doesn't come in an IV formulation. Thiamine should be supplemented in HG patients. Either 50mg thiamine tablets taken orally if tolerated or IV pabrinex are appropriate. This will reduce the risk of Wernicke's.

It usually takes the form of whole-body computed tomography (CT).This has been shown to improve survival outcomes in the trauma patient compared with no CT or focused CT. In the pregnant patient, concerns for the fetus can lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment, resulting in morbidity and mortality for both mother and fetus. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) adresses this by stating that the life of the mother takes precedent over the fetus.A single trauma CT is not thought to have detrimental effects on the fetus in utero, so if indicated — a trauma CT should not be delayed. Fetal radiation exposure ofmGy has not been associated withfetal anomalies, growth restriction or miscarriage, and diagnostic imaging in trauma will likely expose the fetus to less than this amount.Ultrasound extended focused assessment of trauma (eFAST) is used in some parts of the world for initial trauma, but in the UK, the RCR suggests that it is unlikely to add more to a CT so should not delay transfer to a CT scanner. The RCR comments that it is a poor discriminator for the need for a laparotomy because the negative predictive value of a FAST scan is 50-63% in unstable patients."

Stroke Small increased risk ischaemic stroke in women taking oral oestrogen-only or combined HRT. No evidence that transdermal preparations are associated with increased stroke risk. Breast cancer Very small increase in risk of breast cancer (In fact some studies fail to demonstrate an increased risk of breast cancer) Combined HRT absolute risk is 1 extra case of breast cancer per 1,000 women each year. Endometrial cancer Oestrogen-only HRT substantially increases the risk of endometrial cancer in women with a uterus. The use of cyclical progestogen for at least ten days per 28-day cycle lowers this risk. Switching to continuous combined HRT after one year removes the risk. Ovarian cancer Increased risk of ovarian cancer. Rates suggest the increased risk is 1 extra case of ovarian cancer per 1,000 women taking HRT for five years Gallbladder disease"

Antenatal corticosteroid use reduces neonatal death within the first 24 h and therefore should still be given even if delivery is expected within this time.
female genital system,915,A 29-year-old woman is receiving subcutaneous Clexane (low-molecular weight heparin [LMWH]) for the treatment of pulmonary embolism. She is 30 weeks pregnant and develops bruising on her lower arms. The blood pressure in the left lateral position is 125/75 mmHg. What is the most appropriate test for this patient to work out the underlying diagnosis?,Factor Xa levels,APTT,Platelet count,Serum albumin,Serum potassium,C,"This is likely to be heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Long term LMWH treatment has been associated with low platelet counts and this is the test which is likely to provide you with the most information. There are two forms of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Type-1 occurs within the first couple of days of treatment, and resolves spontaneously. It is a direct effect of heparin on platelet activation.  Type 2 HIT is more concerning. It is an immune-mediated disorder which is caused by antibodies to the heparin-platelet factor 4 complex. It typically occurs later in treatment, and in its most severe form can be fatal. It should be suspected if the platelet count falls by more than 50% from baseline, even if the total count remains over 150. It can result in arterial and venous thrombosis. Treatment is to stop heparin treatment immediately, Neither warfarin or platelet transfusions should be given.  Clexane may cause hyperkalaemia, but this is unlikely to cause bruising. Albumin levels may increase in pregnancy but serum albumin may be low due to haemodilution. Again, this would not usually be associated with bruising.  Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is not useful in monitoring LMWH activity, although APTT may be prolonged in high dose Clexane treatment. APTT is increased in intravenous heparin treatment, and is used to adjust doses.  Factor Xa levels can be used to monitor efficacy of treatment with low-molecular weight treatment but the suggestion of bruising here points more to HIT for which Xa levels would not be a useful guide."

The hymen tissue can be excised or left.Transverse vaginal septumIncidence approximately 1:40,000 Presenting symptoms are typically increasing cyclical abdominal pain and absent menstruation. Haematocolpos and occasionally a small haematometra will form. Treatment involves the excision of the septum and end to end vaginal anastomosis.

What is the most appropriate next step in her management?,Repeat ultrasound at 36 weeks gestation,No further imaging required,MRI scan,Repeat ultrasound at 32 weeks gestation,Transvaginal ultrasound,D,"If the placenta is thought to be low lying (less than 20 mm from the internal os) or praevia (covering the os) at the routine fetal anomaly scan, a follow‐up ultrasound examination including a TVS is recommended at 32 weeks of gestation to diagnose persistent low‐lying placenta and/or placenta praevia.Clinicians should be aware that TVS for the diagnosis of placenta praevia or a low‐lying placenta is superior to transabdominal and transperineal approaches, and is safe. TVS will reclassify 26 to 60% of cases where the abdominal USS found a low-lying placenta. Placenta Praevia Placenta praevia describes when the placenta is inserted (partially or completely) into the lower segment of the uterus.Ultarsound Grading Classification:Grade I: low lying placenta: placenta lies in lower uterine segment but its lower edge does not abut the internal cervical os (i.e lower edge 0.5-5.0 cm from internal os). Grade II: marginal praevia: placental tissue reaches the margin of the internal cervical os, but does not cover it Grade III: partial praevia: placenta partially covers the internal cervical os Grade IV: complete praevia: placenta completely covers the internal cervical osNOTE Sometimes grades I & II termed 'minor' praevia whilst III and IV termed 'major' praevia.AIUM ClassificationThe 2018 greentop guidelines noted the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) classification is potentially superior to the above gradings. Candidates should be aware of both as the RCOG has not explicitly advised use of the old grades be discontinued and questions may still emerge on the old gradings.Under the new system the following terms are used:Placenta praevia: is used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os. Low lying placenta: For pregnancies greater than 16 weeks of gestation when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os. Normal: Placental edge is 20 mm or more from the internal os on TAS or TVS"

OHSS Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) Key PointsOHSS is a condition which can effect women taking fertility medication where there is an excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin therapy resulting in ovarian enlargement. There isn't a widely accepted classification system. Traditionally OHSS has been graded as mild, moderate or severe. The proposed RCOG system is shown below Overstimulated ovaries enlarge and release proinflammatry mediators into the bloodstream. The resulting increased vascular permeability leads to fluid loss from the intravascular compartment and is the reason patients can develop ascites and effusions. In severe OHSS significant hypovolaemia can ensue. Changes in fluid distribution and vascular permeability lead to a host of other biochemical disturbances that can result in prothombotic tendency (VTE), electrolyte disturbance inc hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, nausea and tissue oedema.OHSSTrue incidence unknown With conventional IVF estimates mild OHSS with 1 in 3 cycles.

Factors indicating moderate risk are:1st pregnancy Age ≥ 40 years Pregnancy interval of > 10 years BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2 or more at first visit Family history of pre-eclampsia Multi-fetal pregnancy.Aspirin in the management of Pre-eclampsia BackgroundPre-eclampsia effects approximately 3% of pregnancies Significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality Data suggests aspirin is safe to use in pregnancy with negligible adverse outcomes Data shows Aspirin treatment associated with 17% reduction in developing pre-eclampsia when used in at risk groups. Ongoing research into 1st trimester screening for pre-eclampsia using combination of clinical history, mean arterial blood pressure, uterine artery doppler studies and placental biomarkers to calculate maternal risk. This has not been adopted by NICE at this stageAspirin mechanism of actionInhibits cyclooxygenase isoenzymes COX1 and COX2 Blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 (which promotes platelet aggregation) in platelets Also blocks prostacylin formation (which inhibits platelet aggregation) in endothelial cells. As platelets lack a cell nucleus they cannot upregulate thromboxane production whereas endothelial cells can. Hence the overall effect of aspirin is one of inhibiting platelet aggregationNICE advice on Aspirin in Pre-eclampsiaWomen with more than one moderate risk factor or one high risk factor for pre-eclampsia should be advised to take 75-150 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the babyHigh risk factors:hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy chronic kidney disease autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosis or antiphospholipid syndrome type 1 or type 2 diabetes chronic hypertension.Moderate risk factors:first pregnancy age 40 years or older pregnancy interval of more than 10 years body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m² or more at first visit family history of pre-eclampsia multiple pregnancy"

Pelvic ultrasound shows an endometrial thickness of 12 mm with a bulky uterus and normal ovaries with no pelvic pathology. A pipelle biopsy suggests a proliferative endometrium. What treatment is most suited to her?,Tranexemic acid,Mirena IUS,Mefenamic acid,GnRH Analogues,Combined oral contraceptive pill,B,"The possible diagnoses in this patient could be anovulation (given her BMI) with resultant infrequent cycles. Given the findings of bulky uterus and painful heavy periods in a parous woman in the 4–5th decade of life, adenomyosis is a likely diagnosis as well. Mefenamic acid is not suited as NSAIDS are associated with gastric irritation. Plus it is often only a short­term solution. In addition it will not protect the endometrium. Tranexemic acid again may be a short term solution for the bleeding, but will not regulate the cycle or protect the endometrium. There is some link between high doses of tranexemic acid and blood clots given her BMI this may not be the best choice. Also it is unlikely to improve pain. Oral COCP/POP would help with pain and bleeding but require good compliance. With a high BMI, COCPs may not be suited as first line treatments. Mirena® IUS provides a long term solution (5 years), when she is likely to attain menopause. It will also protect the endometrium from high levels of oestrogen exposure. It will also improve pain."

What is the most appropriate place for her care in the postnatal period?,A specialist mother and baby unit where the interactions between the mother and baby can be observed,Home as that is where she will get the best family and social support for her and the baby,A psychiatric hospital due to the high risk of postnatal relapse,She should have an extended stay in hospital as the baby may show signs of extrapyramidal symptoms several months after the haloperidol depot injections,Home but the baby should be admitted into social care initially to protect it from the mother while the risk of relapse is high,A,"Women who need inpatient care for a mental disorder within 12 months of childbirth should normally be admitted to a specialist MBU, unless there are specific reasons for not doing so."
female genital system,1010,Which of the following describes capacitive coupling?,Current transmission to monitoring wires through patient's body,Diathermy touch metal instruments,Active electrode touch metal instruments,"When two conductors are separated by an insulator, a capacitor is created.",Contact between an active electrode and another conducting instrument,D,"Capacitive coupling: When two conductors are separated by an insulator, a capacitor is created. Thus, an insulated active electrode within a metal cannula forms a capacitator which can produce a ‘capacitively coupled’ electrical current that is transferred from the active electrode through the intact insulation into the metal cannula. Insulation failure: The laparoscope only permits a partial view of the cavity and most of the electrode will be out of view as it is activated. If there is a fault in the insulation on the shaft of the electrode a burn may occur. Direct coupling:Direct contact between an active electrode and another conducting instrument can establish an unwanted and unnoticed current path - direct coupling such as an active hook coming close to a grasper where the current could be transmitted to the grasper. Occasionally the only sign is often that the diathermy does not work, therefore turning the power up in such circumstances can be disastrous."

An alternative regime is oral ofloxacin 400 mg twice daily and oral metronidazole 400 mg twice daily for 14 days. This is not recommended if the woman is at high risk of gonococcal PID because of increasing quinolone resistance of gonorrhoea. Levofloxacin may be used as a once-daily, convenient alternative to ofloxacin. The current treatment recommendation for severely ill (pyrexia above 38°C, clinical signs of tubo-ovarian abscess, signs of pelvic peritonitis or pregnancy) patients is: Initial treatment is with doxycycline, single-dose IV ceftriaxone and IV metronidazole, then change to oral doxycycline and metronidazole to complete 14 days of treatment. There is no evidence-based recommendation for treatment in pregnancy, but an empirical regimen might include IM ceftriaxone plus oral or IV erythromycin, with the possible addition of oral or IV metronidazole 500 mg three times daily in clinically severe disease.

female genital system,1069,You are asked to review a 26 year old woman at her antenatal booking visit. You note she has a history of spinal cord injury (SCI) with an injury to the cord at T9 level. Which of the following statements is true regarding pregnancy in patients with an injury at this level?,Patients who develop autonomic dysreflexia (AD) will typically be tachycardic,Patients with a lesion at this level should be advised to have elective Caesarean section,Perception of uterine contractions is reduced,Paient is at high risk of autonomic dysreflexia (AD),Spirometry should be checked as respiratory muscles are typically affected,C,"Perception of uterine contractions is reduced/altered in women with spinal cord lesions above T10 The major muscles of respiration are the diaphragm (innervated by cervical spinal nerves - remember C 3, 4, 5 keeps the diaphragm alive) and the intercostal muscles (innervated by thoracic spinal nerves T1-T6). These are not affected in injuries below T6 so spirometry isn't a requirement in cases of lesions below T6 level.Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) is high risk in patients with injuries above T6. In AD nerve stimuli are able to ascend the spinal cord to T6 level where they reach and trigger a sympathetic response from the major sympathetic preganglionic nerve fibres (remember sympathetic nervous system (ANS) has thoraco-lumbar outflow). The sympathetic response causes vasoconstriction and hypertension.The usual parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) response is unable to descend past the lesion at T6 so the normal parasympathetic response via the sacral outflow does not occur (parasympathetic has cranio-sacral outflow). Note the PNS can still stimulate the cranial outflow above the lesion hence the vagus is stimulated resulting in slowing of the heart rate (bradycardia) and vasodilatation and flushing above the lesion.Lesions above T10 do result in altered perception of fetal movements and uterine contractions. Pregnancy and spinal cord injury Pregnancy and spinal cord injury (SCI) Key PointsWomen with lesions above T6 and T10 need special consideration (see below) All women with SCI are at high risk of pressure ulcers, anaemia and UTI Rate of stillbirths and congenital malformation is not increased when conceiving after spinal cord injury Pregnancy limits mobility further in 4.5% of women with SCI If SCI occurred at a young age, or was associated with pelvic trauma, clinical pelvimetry should be performed Vaginal birth is the usual mode of delivery in women with SCIRisks with lesions above T6Bradycardia Hypotension Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) - hypertension, bradycardia, headache, flushing Respiratory muscles may be affected Spirometry checked if vital capacity (VC)Susceptible to autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and spasms (see below) A rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20-40 mmHg above baseline is considered a sign of ADRisks with lesions above T10Perception of fetal movements is altered Perception of uterine contractions is altered Higher frequency of breech or transverse lie, especially in lesions above T10Autonomic dysreflexiaRefers to an uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response.

An admission to a MBU is not indicated at this stage.b. arrange urgent referral to the perinatal psychiatric team. This is inappropriate because she has already told you that she will not attend and it is likely that she will waste an appointment.c. contact her perinatal team, her GP and community midwife to find out what happened following her last pregnancy and arrange follow up in antenatal clinic to discuss your findings. The first step is to find out about what happened last time around. This patient has told you that she will not engage with the psychiatric team but she has attended antenatal clinic. Therefore ensure that she is given a follow up appointment in antenatal clinic so that you can discuss what happened following her last pregnancy. Once you have the full facts you can explain the recurrence risks to her and try to formulate a plan that she will be happy with. She may agree to see a perinatal psychiatrist (if necessary) once you can give her the full details.d. discharge for GP follow up.

The provision of a method requires expert clinical judgement and/or referral to a specialist contraceptive provider, since use of the method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or not acceptableUKMEC 4 A condition which represents an unacceptable health risk if the method is usedIn practice this usually translates to patients who have conditions that fall into UKMEC 1 and 2 categories being safe to prescribe to whereas those with UKMEC 3 or 4 conditions would be deemed unsafe to prescribe to. There are obviously caveats where it may be deemed appropriate for a patient with a UKMEC 3 condition to use the COCP and those with multiple UKMEC 2 conditions being deemed unsuitable.COCP UKMEC 4 conditions:Age ≥ 35 and smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day Systolic BP ≥160mmHg Diastolic BP ≥100mmHg Vascular disease Ischaemic heart disease Stroke History VTE VTE currently being treated with antioagulants Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation Known thrombogenic mutations eg factor V Leiden Complicated valvular heart disease eg history SBE, tetralogy of Fallot, aortic stenosis.

Suggest she try waxing instead,Start co-cyprindiol,Start Yasmin,Offer topical eflornithine as this is 1st line treatment,Start Microgynon,B,"Although waxing is a legitimate treatment option PCOS does not preclude the use of the COCP. Topical eflorithine is first line treatment for facial hirsutism but shouldn't be given to women under 19 years of age (or pregnant or breastfeeding women).Co-Cyprindiol (Dianette) is licensed for use for hirsutism. It should be stopped 3 to 4 months after resolution of hirsutism. NICE advises consider switching to Yasmin (unlicensed use) if relapse occurs when Dianette is stopped. Note patients should be counselled about increased VTE risk with Dianette and Yasmin compared to other COCPs. Microgynon isn't licensed of for use in treating hirsutism. COCP COCP SafetyThe UKMEC criteria can be useful for assessing the safety of use of the combined oral contraceptive (COCP or CHC) for an individual. The UKMEC criteria classify risks from 1-4 as summarised below:UKMEC Definition of categoryUKMEC 1 A condition for which there is no restriction for the use of the methodUKMEC 2 A condition where the advantages of using the method generally outweigh the theoretical or proven risksUKMEC 3 A condition where the theoretical or proven risks usually outweigh the advantages of using the method. The provision of a method requires expert clinical judgement and/or referral to a specialist contraceptive provider, since use of the method is not usually recommended unless other more appropriate methods are not available or not acceptableUKMEC 4 A condition which represents an unacceptable health risk if the method is usedIn practice this usually translates to patients who have conditions that fall into UKMEC 1 and 2 categories being safe to prescribe to whereas those with UKMEC 3 or 4 conditions would be deemed unsafe to prescribe to. There are obviously caveats where it may be deemed appropriate for a patient with a UKMEC 3 condition to use the COCP and those with multiple UKMEC 2 conditions being deemed unsuitable.

The aim of antenatal testing is to detect early signs of infection.The diagnostic criteria for chorioamnionitis include:Maternal pyrexia Maternal tachycardia Offensive vaginal discharge Fetal tachycardia Uterine tenderness Leucocytosis*It should be noted not all of the above criteria must be met. Maternal pyrexia, offensive vaginal discharge and fetal tachycardia are probably the most important features and if these three are present it indicates chorioamnionitis. Indeed when observing for signs of chorioamnionitis RCOG advise maternal temperature, pulse and fetal heart rate auscultation should be performed regularly.*FBC and CRP have low sensitivity for picking up infection and the RCOG do not recommend their use as screening for chorioamnionitis.The evidence for weekly HVS is not conclusive and although this may be widely practiced it is considered unnecessary by the RCOGBiophysical profile score and Doppler velocimetry can be used but they have limited value in predicting fetal infection.CTG is useful in the detection of chorioamnionitis.

She has dilated from 4cm to 6cm in 4 hours. At your initial assessment she is 6cm dilated with membranes intact. You review her again 2 hours later and the cervix is now 6.5cm dilated with membranes in tact. What is the most appropriate management?,Administer prostaglandins,Review again in 1 hour,Administer oxytocin,Advise amniotomy,Advise C-section delivery,D,"In first labours delay is typically diagnosed if cervical dilatation is less than 2 cm dilatation in 4 hours so this patients progress at initial assessment is borderline. If delay is suspected NICE guidance advises a women should have a repeat vaginal examination 2 hours later and delay should be diagnosed if there is less than 1cm progress. In this case it fits the criteria of delay as she has only dilated 0.5cm in 2 hours.Amniotomy should be advised if delay is confirmed as is the case here.There is little evidence for amniotomy (AKA ARM - Artificial Rupture of Membranes) in any other circumstance apart from delayed labour progress. It shouldn't be used routinely in labour that is progressing well.

Tamoxifen is not used until after delivery.Trustzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against the HER2/neu receptors contraindicated during pregnancy because of reported adverse fetal outcomeThere are no data on other targeted therapies such as vascular endothelial growth factor agonists, including bevacizumab. However, there are no compelling oncological reasons for use of targeted therapies including monoclonal antibodies or small-molecule tyrosine Kinase inhibitors during pregnancy as conventional chemotherapy can be used, allowing these drugs to be reserved for postpartum.What advice should be given to women planning pregnancy following breast cancer?Women planning a pregnancy after treatment for breast cancer should consult their clinical oncologist, breast surgeon and obstetrician. Women on tamoxifen are advised to stop this treatment 3 months before trying to conceive because of the long half-life of the drug and to have any routine imaging before trying to conceive to avoid the need for imaging during pregnancy. Women with metastatic disease should be advised against a further pregnancy as life expectney is limited and treatment of metastatic disease would be compromised."

This deficiency is either a real deficiency due to lack of production of ADH in the hypothalamus/posterior pituitary when it is termed central, cranial or neurological diabetes insipidus.In nephrogenic diabetes insipidous there are either normal or raised levels of ADH however the ADH receptors in the kidney are dysfunctional and therefore the ADH produced is ineffective. As a result of deficient ADH there is diuresis. Diabetes In Pregnancy NICE updated its guidance on management of diabetes in pregnancy in 2015. The current guidelines advise the following regarding management including new HBA1C targets:Advise women with diabetes who are planning to become pregnant to aim to keep their HbA1c level below 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), if this is achievable without causing problematic hypoglycaemia.Reassure women that any reduction in HbA1c level towards the target of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) is likely to reduce the risk of congenital malformations in the baby.Strongly advise women with diabetes whose HbA1c level is above 86 mmol/mol (10%) not to get pregnant because of the associated risks."

female genital system,1264,22 years old lady has Caesarean section scar ectopic pregnancy. What's the best management?,Methotrexate injection into the GS under ultrasound guidance,Expectant management,UAE,Hysterectomy,Suction evacuation,A,"The diagnostic criteria described for diagnosing caesarean scar implantation on transvaginal ultrasound include:I. Empty uterine cavity2. Gestational sac or solid mass of trophoblast located anteriorly at the level of the internal os embedded at the site of the previous lower uterine segment caesarean section scar 3. Thin or absent layer of myometrium between the gestational sac and the bladder.4. Evidence of prominent trophoblastic/placental circulation on Doppler examination.5. Empty endocervical canal.Primary medical treatment consists of using methotrexate, which may be administered by local injection into the gestational sac under ultrasound guidance of systemically by intramuscular injection. Local injection seems to be a more effective means of terminating the pregnancy.The disadvantage of using medical treatment is that the trophoblast remains in situ there is a risk of haemorrhage as the retained, often very vascular, placental tissue degenerates, so some authors have advocated using suction evacuation in addition to methotrexate to hasten resolution and reduce the risk of unpredictable haemorrhage in the follow-up period. Surgical treatment consists of either evacuation of the pregnancy (using suction or hysteroscopic resection) or excision of the pregnancy as an open, Iaparoscopic, or transvaginal procedure.Suction evacuation is probably the most frequently described procedure and has been combined with cervical cerclage, Foley catheter insertion or UAE as additional haemostatic measures.Excisional techniques have the advantage of incorporating a repair of the scar, but these procedures are technically more difficult and invasive, and it is not known whether scar repair reduces the risk of recurrent caesarean scar pregnancy or scar rupture in future pregnancies."
female genital system,1265,A primigravid in the second stage of labour the vacuum pop off twice with descent from 0 to+2 . Choose the most appropriate for situation ?,Observe,Try ventouse again,Seek senior opinion,Forceps,CS,C,"When should vacuum-assisted birth be discontinued and how should a discontinued vacuum procedure be managed ?Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth where there is no evidence of progressive descent with moderate traction during each pull of a correctly applied instrument by an experienced operator. Complete vacuum-assisted birth in the majority of cases with a maximum of three pulls to bring the fetal head on to the perineum. Three additional gentle pulls can be used to ease the head out of the perineum. If there is minimal descent with the first two pulls of a vacuum, the operator should consider whether the application is suboptimal, the fetal position has been incorrectly diagnosed or there is cephalopelvic disproportion. Less experienced operators should stop and seek a second opinion. Experienced operators should re-evaluate the clinical findings and either change approach or discontinue the procedure. Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth if there have been two ‘pop-offs’ of the instrument. Less experienced operators should seek senior support after one ‘pop-off’ to ensure the woman has the best chance of a successful assisted vaginal birth."

However, coagulopathy (with FFP and vitamin K) and hypoglycaemia (with 50% dextrose) should be treated aggressively before delivery. You should involve the critical care team for a multidisciplinary approach. Early liaison with the liver unit should be undertaken in case transfer is required for consideration of liver transplant, e.g. if liver function is not improving or encephalopathy develops."
female genital system,1271,Mifepristone (RU 486) when used to for management of abortion works via what mechanism?,Anti-oestragen,G-protein receptor agonist,Progesterone agonist,Oxytocin receptor agonist,Anti-progestogen,E,"Mifepristone (RU 486) is an anti-progestogen Mifepristone is a synthetic steroidal antiprogestogen. In the presence of progesterone it competes for progesterone receptors acting as an antagonist. Abortion The RCOG syllabus advises that you should be familiar with the pharmacology of drugs used for medical termination of pregnancy. In practice this means you should be familiar with1. Drugs used for abortion itself (Mifepristone and Misoprostol)2. Drugs required depending on Rhesus status3. Antibiotic provision. Details for these are given below1.Medication regimes for medical abortionMedical abortion regimens using 200 mg oral mifepristone and misoprostol are effective and appropriate at any gestation. The misprostol dose varies depending on the gestation asper the table belowGestation Mifepristone dose Misoprostol dose & timing after Mifepristone49 days Mifepristone 200 mg orallly 24-48 hours later by 400 mcg oral misoprostol50 to 63 Mifepristone 200 mg orallly 24-48 hours later by 400 mcg oral misoprostol+ 2nd dose 400 mcg vaginal or oral misoprostal if no abortion within 4 hrs of 1st dose63 days Mifepristone 200 mg orallly 24-48 hours later by misoprostol 800 micrograms(vaginal, buccal or sublingual)9 to 13 weeks Mifepristone 200 mg orallly 36-48 hours later by misoprostol 800 micrograms vaginallyUp to 4 further doses of misoprostol 400 mcg (PO or PV) at 3 hourly intervals13-24 weeks Mifepristone 200 mg orallly 36-48 hours later by misoprostol 800 micrograms vaginally400 micrograms misoprostal (PO or PV) 3 hourly intervals up to 4 doses.If abortion has not occurred mifepristone can then be repeated three hours after the last misoprostol followed by misoprostol 12 hours after that2.Rhesus StatusRhesus Anti-D IgG should be given, by injection into the deltoid muscle, to women who are rhesus D negative and are having an abortion after 10+0 weeks' gestation. Anti-D prophylaxis should not be given to women who are having a medical abortion up to and including 10+0 weeks' gestation. Anti-D prophylaxis should be considered for women who are rhesus D negative and are having a surgical abortion up to and including 10+0 weeks' gestation.3.Infection ProphylaxisAntibiotic prophylaxis should not be routinely offered to women who are having a medical abortionOffer antibiotic prophylaxis to women who are having surgical abortionThe following regimes are suggested:Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for 3 days. Metronidazole for antibiotic prophylaxis in medical or surgical abortion, do not routinely offer it in combination with another broad-spectrum antibiotic such as doxycycline. Metronidazole 1g PR or 800mg PO prior to or at the time of abortion for women was previously advised by RCOG for those who have tested negative for C. trachomatis infection"

female genital system,1273,Several mechanisms have been proposed as to what causes closure of the Ductus Arteriosus (DA) at Parturition. Which of the following is the most important in maintaining the patency of the DA during pregnancy?,Oxytocin,Progesterone and Oestragen,PGE1,Prolactin,PGE2,E,Prostaglandin E1 and E2 help maintain the patency of the DA during pregnancy. PGE2 is by far the most potent and important. It is produced in large quantities by the placenta and the DA itself. Ductus arteriosus The most important chemical for maintaining a patent DA during pregnancy is PGE2. Following delivery there are several mechanisms that lead to ductus constrictionIncrease in arterial PO2 Decrease in blood pressure within the ductus lumen due to the postnatal decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Decrease in PGE2 due to the loss of placental PGE2 production Decrease in the number of PGE2 receptors in the ductus wall Some texts suggest Oxytocin also plays a role The ductus arteriosus typically closes 1-2 days after delivery

female genital system,1279,"A woman has suffered from psoriasis since she was 15 years old. Initially, her disease predominantly caused skin manifestations, which was managed with a variety of creams. Since her mid 20s she has had arthritis with painful joints, despite local injections of steroids and prolonged treatment with methotrexate. Approximately 4 years ago her rheumatologist started once weekly injections with etanercept 50 mg. This relieved her symptoms significantly and her quality of life was dramatically improved. The woman tried to manage without etanercept in early pregnancy however, her symptoms flared and so, following discussion with her rheumatologist and the obstetric consultant, she restarted etanercept 50 mg weekly by subcutaneous injection. She had an elective caesarean delivery for breech presentation. She was taking prednisolone and etanercept antenatally. The etanercept was stopped 2 weeks before the caesarean delivery. Which of the following medications should the woman avoid whilst she is breastfeeding?",Ibuprofen,Etanercept,Codeine,Prednisolone,Paracetamol,C,"Arthritis can flare postpartum and, hence, she will need analgesics. Also, she may need to continue with steroids and etanercept to prevent the postpartum flare of symptoms. There is evidence that etanercept crosses into breast milk in small quantities in human studies but is not absorbed by a breastfed infant. In the few occasions where infant serum levels have been monitored during breastfeeding, these levels were extremely low. Thus, there is no reason to avoid use of etanercept during lactation.Codeine is metabolised to morphine in the liver by an enzyme. It crosses the placenta and is secreted into breast milk. Some people have a variation of the enzyme that changes codeine to morphine faster and more completely than in other people they are known as ultra rapid metabolisers of codeine. Babies of mothers who are ultra rapid metabolisers of codeine are at higher risk of morphine overdose and, therefore, codeine is avoided in breastfeeding mothers following reports of adverse events related to morphine toxicity in children younger than 12 years of age."

female genital system,1290,A child-bearing woman asked you about the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor in pregnancy. Choose the best answer in response to her query.,ACE inhibitors are listed as FDA rating B; they can be used in pregnancy,ACE inhibitor should be changed to angiotensin receptor blocker before conception,ACE inhibitor should be withheld during the first trimester; it is otherwise safe in the second and third trimester,ACE inhibitor should not be used during pregnancy,The drugs can be continued until second trimester because ACE inhibitor has not been shown to be teratogenic,D,"Avoidance of ACE inhibitors at any stage of pregnancy is recommended. Contrary to previous teaching, a United States study (including 29,507 infants born between 1985 and 2000, 209 of whom were exposed to ACE inhibitors in the first trimester only) showed a significant increase in major (in particular, cardiovascular) congenital malformation. Advising that the drugs can be continued until second trimester is therefore incorrect. As a result of this study (published in the New England Journal of Medicine) the FDA changed their ratings of ACE inhibitors to category C for the first trimester and category D during the second and third trimesters. Category C states: 'Animal reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks'. Category D states: 'There is positive evidence of human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks'. Second and third trimester exposure to ACE inhibitors must be avoided because of the association with serious adverse fetal effects, notably oligohydramnios, in utero death, and neonatal anuria and renal failure. The same probably applies to angiotensin receptor blocker and direct renin inhibitor (aliskiren)."
female genital system,1291,You are seeing a 31 year old woman who is 10 weeks gestation. She was diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis 8 weeks ago and started on treatment. Which of the following anti-tuberculosis drugs is most likely to cause peripheral neuropathy?,Ethambutol,Isoniazid,Streptomycin,Rifampicin,Pyrazinamide,B,"Isoniazid may lead to pyridoxine deficiency induced neuropathy via a number of mechanisms. Its metabolites directly inhibit pyridoxine and isoniazid also inhibits the enzyme pyridoxine phosphokinase which activates pyridoxine to pyridoxal 5' phosphate which is the cofactor in many pyridoxine-dependent reactions.Tuberculosis in pregnancy Key PointsOutcomes are the same for those with early diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in pregnancy compared to pregnancies unaffected by tuberculosis Late diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary TB associated with pre-eclampsia, PPH, difficult labour, preterm labour, low birthweight and pneumonia. Extrapulmonary TB Lymphadenitis doesn't have significant effect on perinatal outcome but other extrapulmonary sites including spine, abdomen and central nervous system are associated with increased rates of fetal growth restriction and low Apgar's.Epidemiology of Tuberculosis:14.1 per 100,000 population (UK) 44.3 per 100,000 in London 4.2 per 100,000 pregnancies Almost exclusively seen in ethnic minority women during pregnancy in the UKTreatment1st line for active disease is: Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. 1st line for latent TB: Isoniazid and rifampicin Isoniazid can cause neuropathy - vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) supplementation should be offered to avoid this"

female genital system,1293,A 27 year old patient consults you as you fitted her with a copper intrauterine device (IUCD) 3 months ago and she has just done a positive pregnancy test. She is concerned about ectopic pregnancy. If the patient with an IUCD becomes pregnant what is the incidence of ectopic pregnancy?,1 in 40,1 in 100,1 in 20,1 in 200,1 in 500,C,It is rare for patients with an IUCD in place to become pregnant.If a patient with an IUCD in situ does become pregnant the risk of it being ectopic is around 1 in 20 IUCD Mechanism of ActionPrimary mode of action of copper intrauterine devices (IUD/IUCD/Cu-IUD) is via the toxic effect of copper on the ovum and sperm preventing fertilization. Secondary mechanism is via alterations in the copper content of cervical mucus which may inhibit penetration by sperm. Inflammatory reactions within the endometrium may also prevent implantation should the ovum be fertilised.Effectiveness1-2 per 100 women using IUCD as contraception will become pregnant over 5 years of use. 0.6-0.8% of women will conceive within first year of useSide Effects/RisksHeavy menstrual bleeding Risk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)*Risk of ectopic pregnancy is not increased by IUCD compared to no contraception. In fact risk of ectopic is decreased by IUCD. Although the IUCD doesn't cause ectopic pregnancies it is less effective at preventing ectopic pregnancy than intrauterine pregnancy. The result is that a higher proportion of pregnancies in patients with IUCD are ectopic compared to women using no contraception.

female genital system,1348,A 52­ year­ old woman is referred by her GP to the menopause clinic with hot flushes and night sweats. She is concerned about the risk of breast cancer following the use of HRT. Which of the following statements regarding HRT and breast cancer is true?,The use of estrogen­only HRT is associated with a higher risk compared with combined HRT,Continuous combined HRT accounts for three extra cases in every 1000 women who use it for 5 years between the ages of 50 and 59,Continuous combined HRT accounts for five extra cases in every 1000 women who use it for 2 years between the ages of 50 and 59,The use of tibolone is associated with the highest risk,Continuous combined HRT accounts for three extra cases in every 1000 women who use it for 2 years between the ages of 50 and 59,B,There is a small increase in the risk of developing breast cancer with HRT and it depends on the type of HRT used. Combined HRT (estrogen + progestogens) probably accounts for 3 extra cases in every 1000 women who use it for 5 years between the ages of 50 and 59 years. There appears to be no increase in the risk for shorter term use of less than 3 years. The use of estrogen­only HRT has a lower risk than combined HRT.

How to manage?,US at 14 weeks,US at 18 weeks,Serial us from 16-24 weeks,Vaginal progesterone,Cervical cerclage,C,"Cervical Cerclage Women with singleton pregnancies and three or more previous preterm births should be offered a history-indicated cervical cerclage. Women with a singleton pregnancy and a history of spontaneous second trimester loss or preterm birth who have not undergone a history-indicated cerclage may be offered serial sonographic surveillance, as those who experience cervical shortening may benefit from ultrasound-indicated cerclage while those whose cervix remains long (greater than 25mm) have a low risk of second-trimester loss/preterm birthFor women with a singleton pregnancy and no other risk factors for preterm birth, insertion of cervical cerclage is not recommended in women who have an incidentally identified short cervix. In-women with a previous unsuccessful transvaginal cerclage, insertion of a transabdominal cerclage may be discussed and considered. In women with a singleton pregnancy insertion of an emergency cerclage may delay birth by an average of 34 days, compared with expectant management/bed rest alone in suitable cases. It may also be associatedwith a two-fold reduction in the chance of birth before 34 weeks of gestation. However, there are only limited data to support an associated improvement in neonatal mortality or morbidity. The choice of trans-vaginal cerclage technique (high cervical insertion with bladder mobilization or low cervical insertion) should be at the discretion of the surgeon , but the cerclage should be placed as high as is practically possible."

female genital system,1394,Which of the following drugs should not be prescribed for a breast-feeding mother?,Digoxin,Erythromycin,Tetracycline,Theophylline,Warfarin,C,"Tetracycline should be avoided in breast-feeding mothers because of staining of the infant's teeth. Other drugs to be avoided include amiodarone, lithium, chloramphenicol and vitamin A derivatives. Tetracycline has been assigned to pregnancy category D by the FDA. In pregnancy, with use of tetracycline both congenital defects and maternal hepatotoxicity have been reported. When used during tooth development (second half of pregnancy) tetracyclines may cause permanent yellow-gray-brown discoloration of the teeth and enamel hypoplasia. The use of tetracycline during pregnancy is generally not recommended, especially during the last half of pregnancy. Tetracycline is excreted into human milk in small amounts.

If fetus is rhesus positive, it is at risk of haemolytic disease of fetus and newborn, and the pregnancy will have to be managed with active surveillance for fetal anaemia. If the fetus is rhesus negative, the mother can be largely reassured that her isoimmunised status will not affect the fetus. Cell-free fetal DNA from maternal blood can help determine fetal rhesus status after 10 weeks of gestation. Paternal blood group could help if it is rhesus negative but various possibilities exist if it is rhesus positive. Maternal antibody status, haemoglobin and blood group are of limited clinical value in this clinical situation."

Otherwise, if the bleeding stops, the preparation could be changed to a cyclical preparation."
female genital system,1414,Which factor does not affect the performance of a disinfectant?,pH,Concentration of disinfectant,Type of organisms,Number of organisms present,Water hardness,E,"The concentration of disinfectant, as well as the type of organism, are also important factors.Numbers of organisms ‐ high numbers of organisms leads to clump formation. Organisms inside the clump are shielded from the control method.pH plays an important role in the performance of a disinfectant. Many organisms have an optimum pH at which they work best. Deviation from this optimum value results in loss of activity.Water hardness was historically a problem for disinfectants dissolved in water. However, modern disinfectants are able to withstand water hardness.Temperature is also an important factor: warm liquid disinfectants are more effective than colder ones, as increasing the temperature decreases surface tension whilst also increasing the rate of chemical reactions."

female genital system,1416,You are reviewing a 50 year old women in clinic. She is currently taking microgynon® but has been experiencing hot flushes recently. She feels this is the menopause and asks your advice about blood tests for the menopause and if she can stop contraception. Which of the following is the most appropriate advice?,Advise she can stop contraception,Advise check FSH and if >30 IU/L stop microgynon®,Advise stop microgynon® and check FSH in 2 weeks then review,Advise she can stop contraception at age 52,Advise check FSH and if >40 IU/L stop microgynon®,C,FSH is an unreliable test in patients taking combined hormonal contraception There are a number of considerations in this scenario. If the patient remains on contraception she should ideally be switched as CHC is not recommended beyond age 50.It would not be advised to stop contraception altogether until menopause is confirmed and then following appropriate guidance.FSH is suppressed by CHC so it is not a reliable test whilst a patient is taking CHC. It is advised that the CHC is stopped for 2 weeks before testing. If the first reading is consistent with menopause then a second reading should be taken 4-6 weeks later. If two FSH readings are >30 then the patient should be advised to continue contraception for 1 year before stopping.

female genital system,1419,A 32 year old has a transvaginal ultrasound that shows a left ovarian mass. The ultrasound report describes a unilocular cyst with acoustic enhancement and diffuse homogeneous ground-glass echoes as a result of the haemorrhagic debris. What is the likely diagnosis?,Functional cyst,Physiological cyst,Teratoma,Endometrioma,Germ cell tumour,D,(AKA chocolate cyst) is defined as a blood-containing pseudocyst resulting from endometriosis tissue with haemorrhage.Typical ultrasound features of endometrioma are:Diffuse homogeneous low level echoes Echoes sometimes described as 'ground glass' the result of haemorrhagic materialThe EuropeanSociety of Human Reproduction and Embryology guidelines on management of endometriosis (which replaced the previous RCOG guidelines ) recommends clinicians base the diagnosis of ovarian endometrioma in premenopausal women on the following ultrasound characteristics:Ground glass echogenicity 1 to 4 compartments and no papillary structures with detectable blood flowA point to remember in the exam is that the syllabus expects you to interpret imaging of benign pathology so potentially malignant pathologies such as germ cell tumour are unlikely answers Ultrasound Benign Ovarian Pathologies The RCOG syllabus advises candidates should be able to interpret tests for benign gynaecological conditions. A pelvic transvaginal ultrasound is the single most effective way of evaluating an ovarian mass. With regard to benign masses within the ovary you should be familiar with the ultrasound appearances of the following:Functional cysts Endometriomas Serous cystadenoma Mucinous cystadenoma Mature teratoma
female genital system,1420,A 31 year old is reviewed in the antenatal clinic due to pruritus. There is no obvious skin abnormality. A bile acid level is checked and the result is recorded as 16 micromol/L. This is most in keeping with which of the following diagnoses?,Mild intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Moderate intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Fulminant hepatic failure,Gestational pruritus,Severe intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,D,"Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) should be suspected in women with pruritus, normal skin appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more. For ICP to be diagnosed a raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more is required. Given the level is below this the most likely diagnosis is gestational pruritus Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy Diagnosis & classificationThere is no single diagnostic test for ICP but the diagnosis should be considered in pregnant women who have pruritus, normal skin appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more.Onset is typically in the third trimester. The diagnosis is more likely if it is confirmed that itching and raised bile acids resolve after birth.Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is classed according to peak bile acid levels as shown in the table below:Severity Peak bile acid concentrationMild 19–39 micromol/LModerate 40–99 micromol/LSevere 100 micromol/L or morePrevalenceIn the UK, ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, and 1.2%–1.5% of women of Indian-Asian or Pakistani-Asian originRisksStillbirth is the major concern for pregnant people with ICP. Data suggests that for singleton pregnancies the stillbirth rate is only significantly increased above background rate in those with severe ICP (3.44% vs 0.29%).In twin and multipe pregnancy there appears to be a significant increased risk of stillbirth in pregnant women with ICP compared to those without ICP even if ICP is mild or moderate. For singleton pregnancy:In women with peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L and no other risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk.In women with peak bile acids 40–99 micromol/L and no other risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk until 38–39 weeks' gestation.In women with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is higher than the background riskModerate or severe ICP also carries the following risks:Both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth Meconium stained amniotic fluid during labour and birth More likely to receive neonatal careInvestigationsAdditional laboratory and/or imaging investigations are not recommended unless itch is associated with atypical clinical symptoms, the presence of relevant co-morbidities, or in early onset severe ICP Note this is a change in policy from the RCOG as of 2022 following a retrospective review of 500 women with pruritus and raised bile acid concentrations found no new diagnoses following viral, autoimmune and ultrasound investigations.Given that the likelihood of identifying a viral, autoimmune, or structural cause for the itching and liver derangement that was not suspected on other clinical grounds is extremely low these tests are no longer advised. MonitoringMonitoring is typically via repeat bile acid concentration and liver function tests. Fetal ultrasound and/or cardiotocography (CTG) do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.It is advised patients are monitored in a consultant led clinic given the increased risk of complications.All women should have a repeat bile acid level and liver function tests 1 week after initial test. The timing and frequency after that is down to clinical judgement. The RCOG suggest the following:If the woman has mild ICP with peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L, they could have weekly testing as they approach 38 weeks' gestation in order to inform timing of birth. If the woman has moderate ICP with peak bile acid 40–99 micromol/L, especially if they are approaching 35 weeks' gestation, weekly testing should be considered, as timing of birth may be influenced if levels rise to 100 micromol/L or more. If the woman has severe ICP with peak bile acid 100 micromol/L or more, further routine testing of bile acids might not impact on decision making and therefore may not be routinely requiredManagementAdvise women that there are no treatments that improve pregnancy outcome (or raised bile acid concentrations) and treatments to improve maternal itching are of limited benefit.Timing of birthPatient type Birth timingMild ICPNo other risk factors Consider options of planned birth by 40 weeksModerate ICPNo other risk factors Consider planned birth at 38–39 weeks' gestationSevere ICP Consider planned birth at 35–36 weeks' gestationWomen with one or more of the following additional risk factors warrant consultant review to plan timing of birth:Gestational diabetes Pre-eclampsia Multifetal pregnancyWomen with severe ICP should be offered continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) during delivery"

It is therefore important to ascertain infectivity and manage the common transfusion-related viral infections appropriately.The majority of women with thalassaemia major will have been immunised against hepatitis B, but some women with thalassaemia intermedia may not.Hepatitis C is a common and often asymptomatic virus, so all women who are transfused require hepatitis C antibody testing. If a woman has a positive hepatitis C test, RNA titres should be determined with referral to a hepatologist.Women who have undergone splenectomy are at risk of infection from encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b. UK guidance is that daily penicillin prophylaxis is given to all high-risk splenectomised patients.Women who are allergic to penicillin should be recommended erythromycin. In addition, women should be given Haemophilus infl uenzae type b and the conjugated meningococcal C vaccine as a single dose if they have not received it as part of primary vaccination.

Clinicians should be aware of the increased morbidity associated with varicella infection in adults, including pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis. Rarely, it may result in death. Although varicella infection is much less common in adults than in children, it is associated with a greater morbidity, namely, pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis. As recently as the 1990s, chickenpox resulted in the deaths of 25 people per year in England and Wales 80 % of these deaths occurred in adults. Between 1985 and 1999, there were nine indirect maternal deaths and one late maternal death reported in the UK from complications of maternal varicella infection, suggesting a low case fatality rate. There has been no maternal death from varicella reported in the subsequent confidential enquiries. Pneumonia may be more severe at later gestational ages due to the effects of the gravid uterus on respiratory function."

This has not been adopted by NICE at this stageAspirin mechanism of actionInhibits cyclooxygenase isoenzymes COX1 and COX2 Blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 (which promotes platelet aggregation) in platelets Also blocks prostacylin formation (which inhibits platelet aggregation) in endothelial cells. As platelets lack a cell nucleus they cannot upregulate thromboxane production whereas endothelial cells can. Hence the overall effect of aspirin is one of inhibiting platelet aggregationNICE advice on Aspirin in Pre-eclampsiaWomen with more than one moderate risk factor or one high risk factor for pre-eclampsia should be advised to take 75-150 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the babyHigh risk factors:hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy chronic kidney disease autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosis or antiphospholipid syndrome type 1 or type 2 diabetes chronic hypertension.Moderate risk factors:first pregnancy age 40 years or older pregnancy interval of more than 10 years body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m² or more at first visit family history of pre-eclampsia multiple pregnancy"

D. Threatened miscarriage
E. Torsion of ovarian cyst
Ans. The key is E. Torsion of ovarian cyst. [When the egg is released during ovulation, the sac that held the egg should also disappear. If the egg does not leave the sac in the ovary or if the sac closes before dissolving, it can fill with fluid and form a cyst. The cysts shrink or dissolve after ovulation. Sometimes a cyst can get large and burst or rupture. The larger the cyst, the more likely that ovarian torsion will occur. With ovarian torsion, the blood supply to the ovary can be blocked and permanently hurt the ovary].

female genital system,1472,You are discussing postpartum contraception with a 32 year old woman. She has expressed an interest in the copper intrauterine device (IUCD). She is breastfeeding and is concerned about the risk of perforation? Which of the following statements is true?,The perforation risk is doubled in breast-feeding women compared to non-breastfeeding women,There is no difference in perforation rates between breastfeeding and non-breastfeeding women,The perforation risk is three times higher in breast-feeding women compared to non-breastfeeding women,The perforation risk is six times higher in breast-feeding women compared to non-breastfeeding women,The perforation risk is halved in breast-feeding women compared to non-breastfeeding women,D,The risk of perforation is low. Traditionally quoted as less than 1 per 1000 (Perforation rates are approximately 6 times higher in breastfeeding women IUCD Mechanism of ActionPrimary mode of action of copper intrauterine devices (IUD/IUCD/Cu-IUD) is via the toxic effect of copper on the ovum and sperm preventing fertilization. Secondary mechanism is via alterations in the copper content of cervical mucus which may inhibit penetration by sperm. Inflammatory reactions within the endometrium may also prevent implantation should the ovum be fertilised.Effectiveness1-2 per 100 women using IUCD as contraception will become pregnant over 5 years of use. 0.6-0.8% of women will conceive within first year of useSide Effects/RisksHeavy menstrual bleeding Risk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)*Risk of ectopic pregnancy is not increased by IUCD compared to no contraception. In fact risk of ectopic is decreased by IUCD. Although the IUCD doesn't cause ectopic pregnancies it is less effective at preventing ectopic pregnancy than intrauterine pregnancy. The result is that a higher proportion of pregnancies in patients with IUCD are ectopic compared to women using no contraception.

A word catheter insertion is an alternative and this remains in situ for 3–4 weeks. The greater vestibular gland is very vascular and therefore initial excision of the gland when there is evidence of infection may lead to unnecessary blood loss. The edges should be routinely sent for histological examination in those over the age of 40.Chlamydia is an uncommon cause of infection in the greater vestibular gland.

female genital system,1489,Woman underwent excision of a vulval lesion which turned out to be basal cell carcinoma within 1 cm margin. What to do next?,Wide local radical excision,Refer to oncology,Vulvectomy,Re-excise,Reassure,E,"Squamous vulval cancer-an update Diagnosis is made by biopsy of a suspicious lesion. If the lesion is small and well circumscribed 1t may be possible to perform a wide local excisional biopsy. It is preferable to use clinical photography to have a precise record of the site of the lesion prior to pertorming the excision. A clearance margin of at least 1 cm, including depth, is required. It there 1s no wide margin of normal tissue then the lesion should be biopsied rather than excised. Caution must be exercised when performing excision biopsies. It further surgery 1s necessary, wide local excision can be extremely challenging when the initial leston 1s no longer present.For most lesions, 1t will be more appropriate to take one or multiple biopsies. The procedure can be performed with local anaesthetic using a Keye's biopsy blade . The site of biopsy 1s crucial it should be taken trom the edge of lesion and thus will include adjacent normal epithelium. Plainlignocaine with or without adrenaline is first instilled with a fine needle. A punch biopsy is then driven full thickness through the epithelial surtace. The surrounding skin is pressed to release the desired tissue. A soluble suture is usually required to achieve haemostasis.Pathological examination will confirm histological type of cancer and give details of depth of invasion and clearance margins. Depth of invasion is defined as the measurement from the cpithelial junction of the most superficial adjacent dermal papillae to the deepest point of invasion. It directly correlates with lymph node involvement. Tumours with less than 1 mm invasion have a negligible (less than 120) risk of lymph node metastasis thus the need tor nodal resection iseliminated in these cases. These tumours are termed superficially invasive squamous carcinoma. All other squamous vulval cancers have a risk of nodal spread that is directly correlated to depth of invasion"

female genital system,1499,A 31-year-old female with pulmonary hypertension complains of increasing shortness of breath. She is 36 weeks gestation in her first pregnancy. Which of the following statements is correct?,Chest x ray is contraindicated,Elevated D-dimers rule out PE,Enoxaparin dose should be halved in pregnancy,Nifedipine is contraindicated in pregnancy,Risk of maternal mortality in patients with pulmonary hypertension is 30%,E,"There are multiple causes of shortness of breath in pregnancy, and the patient should be reviewed both by the medical and obstetric team. A chest x ray is not absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy, and can be used if the benefits outweigh the risks. D-dimers are usually elevated in pregnancy, and are therefore used cautiously when considering the diagnosis of PE. They should be interpreted in the clinical context, but may be useful if within the normal range. The dose of enoxaparin is slightly reduced in pregnancy as dosed per weight, but it is not halved. The exact dose depends on the weight of the patient, and can be seen in the British National Formulary (BNF). Nifedipine is not contraindicated in pregnancy, but should be used judiciously. Labetalol and methyldopa are the commonest antihypertensives used in pregnancy. During pregnancy, an index of suspicion should exist for common conditions associated with pregnancy that can be complicated by PH, as these need to be evaluated thoroughly during this critical period. These include pulmonary and amniotic fluid embolisms, which are very common and mostly fatal. Most of the maternal PH-associated deaths occur during labor or within 1 month post-delivery. Patients with pulmonary hypertension have a high mortality of at least 30% - some authors put it at 50% - seemingly highest immediately after delivery. Gold standard for diagnosis is right-heart catheterisation, but echocardiogram can also give useful information. The mainstay of treatment is with pulmonary vasodilators, but use in pregnancy needs to be discussed with the cardiology and obstetric team, and a decision made regarding early delivery of the baby.

female genital system,1500,"A couple attend for pre pregnancy counselling owing to the woman's medical history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). She was diagnosed 5 years ago when she had been investigated for severe fatigue, skin rashes, cold fingers and achy joints. She is known to have SLE with high titre antinuclear factor and double stranded DNA antibodies. Renal biopsy has shown stage 4 lupus nephritis. For the last 2 years, the woman has been in good health, taking prednisolone 7.5 mg, hydroxycholoroquine 200 mg, candesartan 32 mg, ferrous sulphate 200 mg and Adcal D3 one tablet daily. Which of her medications needs to be altered before or during pregnancy?",Prednisolone,Hydroxycholoroquine,Ferrous sulphate,Candesartan,Adcal D3,D,Candesartan is an angiotension 1 receptor antagonist used in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. The evidence so far suggests that it is unsafe to use in any trimester of pregnancy because of disruption of fetal vascular perfusion and renal function secondary to pharmacological suppression of the renin angiotensin system through the AT1 receptor blockade.You should substitute a safe antihypertensive: change candesartan to methyldopa or labetolol.You should continue the disease modifiers hydroxychloroquine and prednisolone as both are safe in pregnancy and withdrawal may lead to a disease flare.

Grade II: marginal praevia: placental tissue reaches the margin of the internal cervical os, but does not cover it Grade III: partial praevia: placenta partially covers the internal cervical os Grade IV: complete praevia: placenta completely covers the internal cervical osNOTE Sometimes grades I & II termed 'minor' praevia whilst III and IV termed 'major' praevia.AIUM ClassificationThe 2018 greentop guidelines noted the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) classification is potentially superior to the above gradings. Candidates should be aware of both as the RCOG has not explicitly advised use of the old grades be discontinued and questions may still emerge on the old gradings.Under the new system the following terms are used:Placenta praevia: is used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os.

She is worried that if she takes hormonal contraception she will also develop DVT. Which of the following advice regardling DVT is incorrect.,The risk of VTE increases with the number of years of usage of a combined hormonal pill,Thrombophillia screen is not recommended routinely before use of combined hormonal contraceptive,Combined oral contraceptives containing a third generation progestogen is associated with an increased risk of venous thromboemolism (VTE) when compared with those containing second generation progestogens,There is little or no data to suggest that there is an increased risk of VTE with oral or injectable progesterone only contraceptives methods,Observational studies have reported that the transdermal patch has a somewhat similar level of VTE risk to combined oral contraceptives containing second generation progestogens,A,"The risk of VTE is highest in the 4 months following the initiation of CHC or when restarting after a break of at least 1 month. The risk then reduces over the next year and remains stable thereafter. Although the risk is high in the first few months of CHC use and then falls, it remains higher than in non users. While women with reduced levels of naturally occurring anticoagulants (anti-thrombin III, Protein C or Protein S) factor V Leiden, or prothrombin gene mutations are predisposed to VTE, FSRH guidance does not recommend the need for routine thrombophillia screening prior to use of CHC, as a negative screen may not exclude all types of thrombophilia."

What is the second line treatment?,Cholestyramine,Antihistaminic,Doxycycline,Rifampicin,Dexamethasone,D,"Intahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy Given that not all women treated with UDCA have biochemical or symptomatic improvement, a sccond-line treatment is sometimes considered. Rifampicin is a cholerctic antibiotic that has been shown to reduce pruritus and enhance bile acid excretion in primary biliary cirrhosis when used in conjunction with UDCA. It has been widely used in pregnancy as an anti-tuberculous agent and, therefore, has good safety data. A 2015 study has reported UDCA and rifampicin dual therapy in women with ICP, and demonstrated a reduction of serum bile acids in 502 of the women treated.Further studies are warranted to establish the extent to which rifampicin may be useful in ICP, and also to investigate any potential benefit to the fetus. Women treated with rifampicin should be warned that it alters the colour of urine and tears. It is advisable to ensure that derangement in liver transaminase is not marked prior to commencing rifampicin treatment, as administration of the drug is associated with hepatic impairment.Other drugs, including cholestyramine and S-adenosyl-1- methionine, are not as effective as UDCA in reducing serum bile acid levels or improving pruritis and are therefore no longer considered as first-line treatments in ICP."

They should be referred for ultrasound to identify PAS. If there is no evidence of PAS on ultrasound they can be returned for a follow up scan at 32 weeks. If there is evidence of PAS they are referred to a specialist centre. Placenta Praevia Placenta praevia describes when the placenta is inserted (partially or completely) into the lower segment of the uterus.Ultarsound Grading Classification:Grade I: low lying placenta: placenta lies in lower uterine segment but its lower edge does not abut the internal cervical os (i.e lower edge 0.5-5.0 cm from internal os). Grade II: marginal praevia: placental tissue reaches the margin of the internal cervical os, but does not cover it Grade III: partial praevia: placenta partially covers the internal cervical os Grade IV: complete praevia: placenta completely covers the internal cervical osNOTE Sometimes grades I & II termed 'minor' praevia whilst III and IV termed 'major' praevia.AIUM ClassificationThe 2018 greentop guidelines noted the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine (AIUM) classification is potentially superior to the above gradings. Candidates should be aware of both as the RCOG has not explicitly advised use of the old grades be discontinued and questions may still emerge on the old gradings.Under the new system the following terms are used:Placenta praevia: is used when the placenta lies directly over the internal os. Low lying placenta: For pregnancies greater than 16 weeks of gestation when the placental edge is less than 20 mm from the internal os. Normal: Placental edge is 20 mm or more from the internal os on TAS or TVS"

Apgar scores for the baby were 8 and 10. How long should the cardiotocography trace be kept for?,30 years,18 years,10 years,25 years,Indefinitely,D,"CTG traces should be kept for 25 years in uncomplicated delivery or indefinitely if there are concerns about future developmental delay If you are asked about how long you should keep CTG traces in the exam there are only two options. The answer is either 25 years or indefinitely.NICE advise the following:Keep cardiotocograph traces for 25 years and, if possible, store them electronically. In cases where there is concern that the baby may experience developmental delay, photocopy cardiotocograph traces and store them indefinitely in case of possible adverse outcomesIn this case the baby has good Apgar scores and there is no concern about the baby experiencing developmental delay so 25 years is appropriate. CTG Analysis NICE updated guidance on CTG analysis in February 2017.Typically the following 4 criteria are used to grade FHR into normal, suspicious or pathological:1. Variability2. FHR3. Accelerations4. DecelerationsIf all 4 are normal then the CTG is classed as normal. A suspicious CTG is one whose features fall into one of the non- reassuring categories and the remainder of the features are reassuring A pathological CTG is one whose features fall into two or more non- reassuring categories or one or more abnormal categoriesNICE Interpretation Variability Range FHR Range Accelerations DecelerationsReassuring 5-25 bpm 110 to 160 Present None or earlyVariable decelerations with no concerning characteristics* for less than 90 minutesNon-Reassuring OR>25 for 15 to 25mins 100 to 109OR161 to 180 absence is of uncertain clinical significance Variable decelerations with no concerning characteristics* for 90 minutes or more ORVariable decelerations with any concerning characteristics* in up to 50% of contractions for 30 minutes or moreORVariable decelerations with any concerning characteristics* in over 50% of contractions for less than 30 minutesORLate decelerations in over 50% of contractions for less than 30 minutes, with no maternal or fetal clinical risk factors such as vaginal bleeding or significant meconiumAbnormal 50 mins or moreOR>25 bpm for 25 minutes or more OR>180 absence is of uncertain clinical significance Variable decelerations with any concerning characteristics* in over 50% of contractions for 30 minutes (or less if any maternal or fetal clinical risk factors [see above])ORLate decelerations for 30 minutes (or less if any maternal or fetal clinical risk factors) ORAcute bradycardia, or a single prolonged deceleration lasting 3 minutes or more* Concerning characteristics of variable decelerations: lasting >60 seconds, reduced baseline variability within the deceleration, failure to return to baseline, biphasic (W) shape no shouldering."
female genital system,1591,A 16 year old girl has been referred as she has amenorrhoea. She reports never having periods. Her mother and 2 sisters menarche was at age 12. On examination you note the patient is 152cm tall and BMI 29.0 and secondary sexual characteristics are not developed. Her FSH is elevated. Prolactin is normal. What is the suspected diagnosis?,Kallman Syndrome,Androgen Resistance Syndrome,Turner Syndrome,Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism,Anorexia Nervosa,C,"This patient has Turner Syndrome. Turner Syndrome can cause a vast array of features but these are not all typically present and some may be very subtle. You will not always be given the tell tale features of heart murmur and webbed neck. Although often picked up in prenatal screening or during infancy due to congenital abnormalities in particular heart problems. It is common for Turner syndrome to be picked up when a girl fails to develop secondary sexual characteristics and has primary amenorrhoea. Kallman Syndrome is AKA Hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism. The hormone profile here would show low FSH and LH typically.Anorexia should be considered but given the BMI, raised FSH and no clinical history to suggest eating disorder this is not the most appropriate answer. Secondary sexual characteristics would be present in Androgen resistance syndrome."

Fertility may be reduced during treatment, but this usually reverses upon stopping. Advice regarding reduced fertility and potential teratogenicity applies to both females and males who are taking methotrexate. There is little published information on the potential teratogenicity following paternal exposure to methotrexate. There have, however, been reports of alterations of the spermatozoa and oligospermia following exposure to methotrexate. These seem to be reversible on cessation of treatment.

female genital system,1607,Treating depressive disorders in pregnancy is important because of which of the following ?,There are no negative effects on the fetus as cognitive behavioural therapy is used first line,Antidepressant exposure in utero is not associated with adverse fetal effects,Suicide is a leading cause of death in mothers,Women who experience depression in pregnancy are more likely to opt for antidepressant treatment,Antidepressants have not been associated with neurodevelopmental delay,C,"The importance of psychiatric disease during and after pregnancy has been highlighted by the Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Death and the NICE Guideline CG192. In the 2000–2002 CMACE report, suicide was one of the most common causes of maternal death and a recent enquiry reported almost a quarter of maternal deaths occurring between 6 weeks and 1 year after the end of pregnancy are due to psychiatric causes.The other answers are incorrect because:A. Antidepressant exposure in utero is not associated with adverse fetal effects. Antidepressants have been shown to be associated with adverse effects for the developing fetus including persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn and poor neonatal adaptation syndrome.Studies investigating congenital abnormalities have shown largelyinconsistent results.B. Antidepressants have not been associated with neurodevelopmental delay. Whilst antidepressant exposure has not been associated with neurodevelopmental delay, there is a lack of robust evidence regarding the safety of psychotropic medication.C. There are no negative effects on the fetus as cognitive behavioural therapy is used first line. The decision as to the most appropriate treatment depends on the severity of the depression, what has worked before and patient choice. Psychological therapies may be preferred as they avoid the effect of the medication on the fetus.D. Women who experience depression in pregnancy are more likely to opt for antidepressant treatment. Decisions about medication in pregnancy can be very challenging for women in the perinatal period. They must weigh up the risks and benefits of treatment to both themselves and their fetus/infant."

Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth where there is no evidence of progressive descent with moderate traction during each pull of a correctly applied instrument by an experienced operator.Complete vacuum-assisted birth in the majority of cases with a maximum of three pulls to bring the fetal head on to the perineum. Three additional gentle pulls can be used to ease the head out of the perineum.If there is minimal descent with the first two pulls of a vacuum, the operator should consider whether the application is suboptimal, the fetal position has been incorrectly diagnosed or there is cephalopelvic disproportion. Less experienced operators should stop and seek a secondopinion. Experienced operators should re-evaluate the clinical findings and either change approach or discontinue the procedure.Discontinue vacuum-assisted birth if there have been two ‘pop-offs’ of the instrument. Less experienced operators should seek senior support after one ‘pop-off’ to ensure the woman has the best chance of a successful assisted vaginal birth."

female genital system,1621,At what age risk reducing ovarian surgery done in BRCA patients?,30-35,35-40,40-45,45-50,>50,B,"Timing of risk-reducing surgery in BRCA inheritanceThis can be a difficult decision involving balancing the procedure-related consequences of sterility and premature menopause against the risk of ovarian and tubal cancer. BRCA1 carriers develop ovarian cancer at a younger age than BRCA2 carriers. Of women with a BRCA1 mutation and ovarian cancer, 54% are diagnosed before the age of 50 years. Diagnosis before the age of 40 is uncommon and under the age of 30 is rare. Given that the age of onset is usually over 40 it is appropriate to consider rrBSO for BRCA1 carriers after the age of 35 once childbearing is completed. BRCA2 carriers reach a 2-3% incidence a decade later, by age 50 years and the average age at diagnosis is 60 years - similar to the general population. Based on this difference in the likely age of onset of ovarian cancer, BRCA2 carriers may wish to delay their risk-reducing surgery but by doing this they would not benefit from the reduction in breast cancer afforded by salpingo-oophorectomy.Women considering rrBSO who have not completed childbearing should be counselled about alternative reproductive options including embryo cryopreservation.Preservation of ovarian tissue is under investigation.Surrogacy is an option for those undergoing concurrent hysterectomy."

Upon delivery the new born babies first breath inflates the lungs and this causes a rise in pO2. Oxygen is known to cause constriction of the DA in vivo and in vitro. In addition the decreased vascular resistance means the pressure within the lumen of the DA drops aiding closure.In addition on inflation of the lungs, the lungs produce bradykinin which stimulates smooth muscle constriction of the ductus.The most important factor is thought to be the drop in Prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin E2 maintains patency of the Ductus in the unborn child but after birth is metabolised in the lungs and its levels fall rapidly within 3 hours of birth."

Which drugs to prevent post-partum hemorrhage?,Syntometrine,Oxytocin 10 U,Oxytocin 51U,Methergine,Carboprost,A,"Minimising risk reducing blood loss at delivery Uterine massage is of no benefit in the prophylaxis of PPH. Prophylactic uterotonics should be routinely offered in the management of the third stage of labour in all women as they reduce the risk of PPH.For women without risk factors for PPH delivering vaginally, oxytocin (10 iu by intramuscular injection) is the agent of choice for prophylaxis in the third stage of labour. A higher dose of oxytocin is unlikely to be beneficial.For women delivering by caesarean section, oxytocin (5 iu by slow intravenous injection) should be used to encourage contraction of the uterus and to decrease blood loss.Ergometrine-oxytocin may be used in the absence of hypertension in women at increased risk of haemorrhage as it reduces the risk of minor PPH (500-1000 ml).For women at increased risk of haemorrhage, it is possible that a combination of preventative measures might be superior to syntocinon alone to prevent PPH.Clinicians should consider the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (0.5-1.0 g), in addition to oxytocin, at caesarean section to reduce blood loss in women at increased risk of PPH."

There are no obstetric or fetal contraindications to external cephalic version (ECV). An initial ECV without tocolysis failed two days earlier. What is the most appropriate management option?",Another ECV without tocolysis,Caesarean section at 38 weeks of gestation,Postural management,Another ECV with tocolysis,Vaginal breech delivery,D,ECV should be offered after 37 weeks of gestation in multiparouswomen and after 36 weeks of gestation in primiparous women. Another ECV can be offered if the first one fails. The use of tocolysis increases the success rate after a failed initial attempt. If a caesarean secton is offered it needs to be after 38+6 weeks of gestation. Breech delivery may not be the most appropriate management considering she is primiparous. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of postural management or Moxibustion as a method of promoting spontaneous version over ECV.

female genital system,1667,You are discussing contraception with a 24 year old woman. She has expressed an interest in the copper intrauterine device (IUCD). You discuss potential side effects. Which of the following is the commonest reason for discontinued use of the IUCD?,Development of pelvic infection,Spontaneous expulsion of IUCD after fitting,Unacceptable vaginal bleeding,Irregular periods,Development of vaginal odour,C,Heavy and longer menstrual periods occur in most women. There is frequently bleeding between periods and worsening period pains.Up to 50% of women discontinue the IUCD within 5 years. Most commonly due to unacceptable vaginal bleeding and pain IUCD Mechanism of ActionPrimary mode of action of copper intrauterine devices (IUD/IUCD/Cu-IUD) is via the toxic effect of copper on the ovum and sperm preventing fertilization. Secondary mechanism is via alterations in the copper content of cervical mucus which may inhibit penetration by sperm. Inflammatory reactions within the endometrium may also prevent implantation should the ovum be fertilised.Effectiveness1-2 per 100 women using IUCD as contraception will become pregnant over 5 years of use. 0.6-0.8% of women will conceive within first year of useSide Effects/RisksHeavy menstrual bleeding Risk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)*Risk of ectopic pregnancy is not increased by IUCD compared to no contraception. In fact risk of ectopic is decreased by IUCD. Although the IUCD doesn't cause ectopic pregnancies it is less effective at preventing ectopic pregnancy than intrauterine pregnancy. The result is that a higher proportion of pregnancies in patients with IUCD are ectopic compared to women using no contraception.
female genital system,1668,Which of the following factors is associated with ectopic pregnancy?,High alcohol consumption,Ovarian fibroids,Previous caesarian section,Previous termination of pregnancy,Progesterone only contraceptive pill,E,"Ectopic pregnancy is a relatively rare condition presenting typically with severe lower abdominal pain plus/minus vaginal bleeding. It typically occurs six weeks after the last period. Predisposing factors include any condition that may damage the fallopian tubes. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is the commonest predisposing factor. Others include:  Endometriosis Congenital fallopian tube abnormalities Previous fallopian tube surgery (or pelvic surgery - adhesions) Prior ectopic pregnancy IVF/ovarian stimulation Smoking, and Increasing age.  The IUCD although protective against pregnancy per se, is frequently implicated in ectopic pregnancy. Although the incidence of pregnancy is low (less than 1% depending on type of IUCD) in those who do become pregnant the (relative) risk of an ectopic pregnancy is higher than in a pregnancy in a woman who does not have an IUCD. The progesterone only pill is also associated with an increased rate of ectopic pregnancy if the patient does become pregnant whilst taking this preparation. There may be a slightly increased risk with the combined oral contraceptive pill too (although this is not clearly established)."

Ongoing research into 1st trimester screening for pre-eclampsia using combination of clinical history, mean arterial blood pressure, uterine artery doppler studies and placental biomarkers to calculate maternal risk. This has not been adopted by NICE at this stageAspirin mechanism of actionInhibits cyclooxygenase isoenzymes COX1 and COX2 Blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 (which promotes platelet aggregation) in platelets Also blocks prostacylin formation (which inhibits platelet aggregation) in endothelial cells. As platelets lack a cell nucleus they cannot upregulate thromboxane production whereas endothelial cells can.

Outflow Tract Disorders BackgroundThe urogenital system develops from intermediate mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity and the endoderm of the urogenital sinus. Incidence of congenital anomalies of the genital tract 3% Primarily abnormalities of uterine fusion with septate uteri constituting 90% of cases (uterine abnormalities are considered seperately)MRKH syndrome (uterovaginal agenesis)Incidence approximately 1:5000 female births Genetics not fully understood. Features result of Mullerian agenesis. Patients present as teenagers with primary amenorrhoea due to absent uterus and vagina. There are normal secondary sexual characteristics due to functioning ovaries. 40% have associated renal abnormality. Treatment typically involves psychological support and use of vaginal dilators to dilate the vaginal dimple to allow sexual intercourse. Surgical treatment is also an option.Imperforate HymenThin membrane that occurs at the junction of the sinovaginal bulb with the urogenital sinus Usually perforated during fetal life If remains imperforate then a haematocolpos (blood collection in the vagina proximal to the hymen) may form when menstruation occurs. Treatment involves a cruciate incision to relieve the obstruction. The hymen tissue can be excised or left.Transverse vaginal septumIncidence approximately 1:40,000 Presenting symptoms are typically increasing cyclical abdominal pain and absent menstruation. Haematocolpos and occasionally a small haematometra will form. Treatment involves the excision of the septum and end to end vaginal anastomosis. Vaginal mould for 10 days after surgery and use of vaginal dilators reduce the risk of stenosis. Pregnancy rates are: 100% with lower 1/3 obstruction, 40% with middle 1/3 and 20% with upper third.A=upper third septum, B = middle third septum, C = lower third septumLongitudinal vaginal septumThese fusion defects may occur in the presence of two hemi-uteri and two hemi- cervices. Each cervix fuses with the urogenital sinus to develop into two hemi-vaginas. Presents typically with difficulty inserting tampons, painful sexual intercourse or sometimes found during pregnancy. Can present with a mass if one hemi-vagina is blind ending and accumulates blood. The patient should still appear to have normal menses however as blood will flow via the other hemi-vagina.

Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Dissecting aortic aneurysm,Musculoskeletal chest pain,Myocardial infarction,Pneumothorax,Pulmonary embolism,E,"The most likely cause of the lady's tachycardia, hypoxia, and pleuritic sounding chest pain is a pulmonary embolism (PE). Pregnancy is a risk factor, as it results in a prothrombotic tendency. A CXR and ECG should be considered to rule out a myocardial infarct or other chest pathology like pneumothorax or pneumonia. D-Dimer is generally not used as it is elevated in pregnancy. Imaging with CTPA or V/Q scan should be considered following discussion with the obstetrics and radiology teams. Treatment is with either low-molecular weight heparin (first and late third trimester) or warfarin (second and early third trimester), depending on the stage of pregnancy.  A myocardial infarct classically presents with a more acute onset of chest pain, which is described as crushing and may radiate to the jaw or left arm. Worsening on inspiration is not classical. A dissecting aortic aneurysm classically results in different blood pressures in the arms, and respiratory symptoms are less likely. Pneumothorax is not as associated with pregnancy as a PE, and you would expect the patient to be more hypoxic with signs on chest examination if this were the diagnosis. Whilst musculoskeletal chest pain is a possibility, this is usually a diagnosis of exclusion once you are confident a more serious pathology does not exist.  "

female genital system,1788,Axonotmesis is best described as an iatrogenic nerve injury which involves:,Long recovery period usually extending to few years,Poor chances of regeneration despite restorative surgery,Damage occurring to the axon with preservation of the supporting Schwann cells,Need for restorative surgery in most cases,Axon transection injury related to incorrect incision sites,C,"Iatrogenic nerve injury following gynaecological surgery occurs more commonly than is recognised and is a significant cause of postoperative neuropathy. Neuropathy results when there is a disruption to the blood supply of the nerve caused by injury. Three types of microvascular changes occur with nerve injury. Neuropraxia is the result of external nerve compression leading to a disruption of conduction across a small portion of the axon. Nerve recovery takes weeks or months once remyelination occurs. Axonotmesis is caused by profound nerve compression or traction. Damage occurs to the axon only, with preservation of the supporting Schwann cells. Regeneration is possible because supporting Schwann cells remain intact. Recovery time is longer than neuropraxia. The most severe form of injury is termed neurotmesis, and it results from complete nerve transection or ligation, where both the axon and Schwann cells are disrupted. Regeneration is rendered impossible, and without restorative surgery, prognosis is usually poor"

All her routine antenatal investigations performed in the first trimester are normal. Her blood group is B negative with a negative indirect Coomb’s test performed at 28 weeks of gestation. A scan unfortunately shows no fetal heart present, which is confirmed by two sonographers. Which laboratory investigation is most urgently required?",Kleihauer test,Random blood glucose and HbA1c,Coagulation studies,Maternal thrombophilia screen,Bile salts,A,"Women who are rhesus D negative should be advised to have an urgent Kleihauer test to detect large feto– maternal haemorrhage (FMH) that may have occurred a few days earlier.This will mimimise the delay in administration of the correct dose of anti D.Major FMH is a silent cause of IUFD and a Kleihauer test is recommended for all women to diagnose the cause of death. Tests should be undertaken before birth as red cells might clear quickly from maternal circulation.Rarely, a woman will have incidental type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and women with gestational DM have a normal HbA1c and also these women return to normal glucose tolerance within a few hours after late IUFD has occurred.There is risk of coagulopathy. IUFD can occur secondary to maternal sepsis, placental abruption and pre eclampsia, which all increase the risk of DIC. Therefore, coagulation tests are performed for maternal wellbeing but these are not the most urgent investigation if the woman is stable and not actively bleeding.There is neither fetal growth restriction nor a history of high blood pressure or placental disease, therefore, a maternal thrombophilia screen is not required.Bile acids are performed routinely but levels gradually decline over 6 weeks postnatally and, therefore, are not the highest level of urgency."

female genital system,1851,You are asked to talk to a 20 year old woman in clinic. She saw her GP after starting to feel unwell after looking after her friends cats. The GP organised serological tests which were positive for toxoplasmosis IgM and IgG. The patient has subsequently found out she is pregnant. She is worried that her illness was in the first few weeks of her pregnancy. What would you advise her regarding the risk of toxoplasmosis transmission to the fetus if maternal infection occurs within the first 4 weeks of pregnancy?,risk of fetal transmission is >90%,risk of fetal transmission is >60%,risk of fetal transmission is 30-40%,risk of fetal transmission is 5-15%,risk of fetal transmission is <1%,E,"risk of fetal transmission is As can be seen below the risk of transmission to the fetus is lower if maternal seroconversion occurs earlier in pregnancy:13 weeks: risk of fetal transmission is approximately 10% 36 weeks: risk of fetal transmission is >60%The patient should be counselled that although the risk of transmission is low, if transmission does occur in early pregnancy then the risk of congenital abnormality to the fetus is higher than if transmission occurs later in pregnancy.In practice this means that the group at highest overall risk are babies born to mothers who seroconvert in middle pregnancy. This is because those who seroconvert in very early pregnancy rarely transmit the infection to the fetus (>99% won't transmit the infection at gestations less than four weeks) whilst even though the majority of those that seroconvert in late pregnancy will transmit the infection the risk of sequelae is at its lowest.This patient should be started on spiramycin and the option of amniocentesis for fetal diagnosis at 16 weeks discussed. Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis Key PointsToxoplasma gondii is an intracellular protozoan parasite Primary host and source of infection is domestic cats T. gondii oocysts excreted in cat faeces, mature in environment and then ingested by secondary hosts which include humans Fetal consequences more severe if infection takes place within 10 weeks of conception Maternal-fetal transmission risk increases as the pregnancy proceeds but the consequences become less severe May cause miscarriage or fetal abnormalities such as microcephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral calcifications, cerebral palsy, epilepsy choroidoretinitis and thrombocytopenia. Diagnosis can be via PCR or Immunoglobulins (IgM,IgG and IgA). MRI/CT may show ring enhancing lesions in CNS tissues. Treatment not usually required in the immunocompetent. In pregnancy treatment is indicated if recent infection suspected Treatment varies depending on local protocols (Spiromycin or combination of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid)"
female genital system,1852,A 31 year old who is 34 weeks gestation is admitted to the ward. She has been admitted with high blood pressure and proteinuria. Her U&Es are reported back as below:,Serum urea above 12 mmol/l despite medical management is a pregnancy-specific indicator for renal replacement therapy,Acute kidney injury most commonly occurs in women with pre‐existing renal disease,This patient has normal renal function,This patient should have a fluid restriction of 80 ml/hour in the peripartum period,Magnesium sulphate infusion should be avoided based on her U&E's,D,"intravenous hydration in women with pre‐eclampsia is associated with pulmonary oedema and increased maternal mortality This patient has a creatinine > 90 which in pregnancy indicates AKI.Acute kidney injury most commonly occurs in women without pre‐existing renal disease.Magnesium sulphate infusion may be appropriate to manage pre-eclampsia. There are cautions to be aware of however. If urine output falls to90 µmol/l a 50% dose reduction in magnesium sulphate infusion should be considered (1 g/hour to 0.5 g/hour). The usual loading dose of 4 g is given in severe pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.A serum urea above 17 mmol/l despite medical management is a pregnancy‐specific indicator for renal replacement therapyIV hydration is associated with increased risks of pulmonary oedema and aggressive fluid management does not have good evidence for improved maternal or fetal outcomes in pregnancy. Women with pre‐eclampsia should therefore have a fluid restriction of 80 ml/hour peripartum to reduce these risks Acute Kidney Injury in pregnancy Key PointsIncreased renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate in pregnancy Serum creatinine falls by approximately 35 µmol/l in pregnancy Non pregnant creatinine reference ranges not accurate Any creatinine > 90 µmol/l in pregnancy should be considered diagnostic of AKI AKI complicates 1.4% of UK obstetric admissions Pre-eclampsia most common cause Pre‐eclampsia leads to AKI in only 1.5–2% of cases Management involves careful fluid management, drug review and in severe cases renal replacement therapy"
female genital system,1853,Uterine sarcoma was diagnosed on histopathology of patient who had TAH BSO for fibroid uterus. What will be your advice?,"MRl abdomen, pelvis",CT abdomen and pelvis,Chest X-ray,CT abdomen pelvis chest,PET Scan,E,"Although MRI and computed tomography (CT) may be able to describe a pelvic mass, there is definite difficulty in distinguishing between leiomyosarcomas and degenerating uterine fibroids. Other conditions that mimic the appearance of sarcomas when using CT or MRI are:adenomyois, IV leiomyomatosis, lymphomaendometrial carcinoma.However. using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with a gadolinium-based contrast agent increases the likelihood of differentiating between leiomyosarcomas and degenerated fibroids. Combined use of dynamic MRI and serum measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) isozymes increased all thesevalues to 100%. Similarly, fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has also been shown to be of some use in the differentiation of uterine leiomyosarcomas."
female genital system,1854,You are reviewing a 34 year old patient in clinic who complains of heavy menstrual bleeding. You are discussing the pros and cons of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS or LNG-IUS). Which of the following statements regarding the LNG-IUS is true?,LNG-IUS use is associated with a significant increase in risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE),The overall risk of ectopic pregnancy is reduced with LNG-IUS compared to no contraception,Risk of uterine perforation with LNG-IUS is approximately 1%,Lack of libido is a common side effect,LNG-IUS use is associated with a slight increase in risk of breast cancer,B,Ectopic pregnancy rates are reduced with LNG-IUS compared to no contraception. Although if pregnancy does occur there is a higher chance it will be ectopic.Evidence fails to support lack of libido with LNG-IUS and also fails to support a link with breast cancer.There is little or no increased risk of VTE or MI associated with LNG-IUS use. IUS Mode of actionThe levonorgestrel intrauterine system (IUS or LNG-IUS) primary contraceptive effect is brought about by its suppressant effect on the endometrium preventing implantation. Following insertion high intrauterine levonorgestrel levels cause endometrial atrophy. There is also an increase in endometrial phagocytic cells preventing implantation. Thickened cervical mucus reduces sperm penetration and migrationEfficacyFailure rates very low at 1% over 5 yearsComplicationsRisk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)

How common is expulsion of an IUCD (over 5 years)?,1 in 10 women,1 in 20 women,1 in 100 women,1 in 200 women,1 in 1000 women,B,If expulsion of the IUCD occurs it usually happens within 3 months of fitting.It occurs in around 1 in 20 women over 5 years. IUCD Mechanism of ActionPrimary mode of action of copper intrauterine devices (IUD/IUCD/Cu-IUD) is via the toxic effect of copper on the ovum and sperm preventing fertilization. Secondary mechanism is via alterations in the copper content of cervical mucus which may inhibit penetration by sperm. Inflammatory reactions within the endometrium may also prevent implantation should the ovum be fertilised.Effectiveness1-2 per 100 women using IUCD as contraception will become pregnant over 5 years of use. 0.6-0.8% of women will conceive within first year of useSide Effects/RisksHeavy menstrual bleeding Risk of exacerbating pelvic infection Higher proportion ectopic pregnancy if pregnancy occurs* (1 in 20) Expulsion (1 in 20) Uterine perforation (Up to 0.2%)*Risk of ectopic pregnancy is not increased by IUCD compared to no contraception. In fact risk of ectopic is decreased by IUCD. Although the IUCD doesn't cause ectopic pregnancies it is less effective at preventing ectopic pregnancy than intrauterine pregnancy. The result is that a higher proportion of pregnancies in patients with IUCD are ectopic compared to women using no contraception.
female genital system,1859,You are the O&G speciality trainee on call for the labour ward. You are asked to review a primigravid woman in spontaneous labour at 39 weeks of gestation. The midwife has asked you to review the woman because there is failure of progress during the second stage of labour. There is doubt about the fetal presentation. On vaginal examination you diagnose a face presentation. The cervix is fully dilated and the CTG is reassuring. Which of the following suggests that a forceps delivery could be attempted?,One fifth of head palpable per abdomen,Brow presentation,Mento–posterior position,A hollow sacrum,Mento–anterior position,E,"The correct answer is mento–anterior position as this indicates that vaginal delivery is possible. If the position was mento–posterior position then vaginal delivery would not be possible. A hollow sacrum would mean that the presenting part is too high for delivery (only fully engaged when presenting part at +2/+3, i.e. delivery should only be done if almost crowning). This is also true in situations where one fifth of the head is palpable per abdomen. Brow presentation also indicates that vaginal delivery is not possible."
female genital system,1860,One of the following is contraindicated by MHRA during breastfeeding?,Naproxen,Codeine,Ibuprofen,Paracetamol,None of the above,B,"Codeine and Breastfeeding During lactation analgesics such as paracetamol, ibuprofen or naproxen (unless contraindicated) should preferably be used and codeine or other opioid only considered as a third line analgesics.In June 2013 the MHRA issued guidance that codeine should no longer be used by breastfeeding women . This is due to the concern that individuals vary in the way their bodiesmetabolise codeine.Codeine is converted to morphine in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme. There are many genetic variations of CYP2D6, which affect the extent of this conversion in individuals. This leads to differences in the plasma levels of morphine and different levels of pain relief. This then leads to a variable and unpredictable risk of side effects due to morphine’s action on the brain and respiratory centre. For some this can result in no benefit from the drug, for others that they experience excessive drowsiness and constipation. For breastfeeding mothers in the latter group this may also lead their babies to experience respiratory depression."

This can be expressed as a fraction or decimal. For example if you have a risk of VTE of 1/1000 pregnancies this may be expressed as 0.001Relative risk is used to compare the risk in two different groups of people e.g. pregnant and non-pregnant women. If the risk of VTE in a healthy non-pregnant women is 2 per 10,000 vs 8-10 per 10,000 in pregnancy then the relative risk is 4 to 5 times (In large US studies figure works out at 4.3) Note Some sources such as SIGN quote relative risk of VTE in pregnancy as high as 10 fold that for non-pregnant patients. This is higher than the RCOG figure and may reflect the risk variation amongst those with other VTE risk factors e.g. age, smoking, obesity. Diagram illustrating Risk Factor stratification for VTE"

The two main cautions are:Should be avoided in uncontrolled severe asthma Should be avoided in severe hepatic impairmentIt was previously advised that repeated use as an emergency contraceptive within a menstrual cycle was contraindicated but this is no longer the case.Presribers also need to be aware of other factors that may effect drug efficacy. This includes taking enzyme inducing drugs eg phenytoin or rifampicin. If the patient is taking these then ideally a Cu-IUD should be offered. If Cu-IUD is unacceptable another option, if the UPSI has taken place within 72 hours, is to offer double dose levonorgestrel.

female genital system,1888,A woman has been recommended to undergo hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo- oophorectomy for benign disease. You discuss the risks and benefits of an open versus a laparoscopic procedure. Which sort of injury is more common at laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to an open procedure?,Urinary tract,Bowel,Ovary,Vascular,Nerve,A,"Laparoscopic surgery involves risks to bowel, urinary tract and major blood vessels. These risks are higher in women who are obese or significantly underweight, however the risks of laparotomy are significantly greater in the morbidly obese. Urinary tract injury and vaginal cuff dehiscence are more common in the laparoscopic approach with an odds ratio of 2.61 for urinary tract injury."
female genital system,1889,A 60yearold woman is diagnosed to have stage IV ovarian cancer. She wants to know when death will occur.What is the most appropriate approach to answer her question ?,Acknowledge to the woman how hard it must be to accept that healthcare professionals cannot really predict when death will occur but suggest sympathetically that she may live for a few months,Avoid any attempt to give an accurate answer because healthcare professionals cannot really predict when death will occur,Acknowledge to the woman how hard it must be to accept that healthcare professionals cannot really predict when death will occur but explain how deterioration might be identified,Attempt to give as long duration as possible so she is not depressed or losses interest in life,Advise her that it is best to prepare as soon as possible so she doesn’t miss out on anything she wants to do,C,"Although professionals are not good at giving accurate prognoses for individual patients due to a lack of accurate predictive tools, we can explain to patients how their functional status may change to give a guide for them to selfidentify what is happening to them. In addition, it is generally to be expected that someone who is functionally deteriorating on a monthly basis may live months, on a weekly basis may live weeks and on a daily basis may live days. This can be carefully explored with patients while also explaining it is not a precise prediction."
female genital system,1890,"A 25 year old nulliparous woman is referred to the obstetric medicine clinic at 14 weeks of gestation with a history of asthma. She takes an inhaled corticosteroid twice daily (400 micrograms) and reports using her short acting beta agonist inhaler twice a month. She has had no recent hospital admissions due to exacerbations of her asthma, and has never been admitted to ICU. She is extremely concerned regarding the maternal and fetal effects of her asthma and medication. Which of the following is the most important advice regarding her ongoing management?",Continue with her current medical regimen and reassure that there are no adverse effects of inhaled steroids or short acting beta agonists,Leukotriene inhibitors should be commenced as the next step in the event of a deterioration in her asthma symptoms,Add a long acting beta agonist (LABA) to her current medical management,Regular antenatal clinic review as she is at increased risk of fetal growth restriction and pre eclampsia,Avoid oral steroid therapy due to the increased risk of congenital malformations,A,"The scenario describes a patient currently on step 2 treatment (regular preventer therapy) and appears to be well controlled.There is therefore no need to alter her management at present.Avoiding oral steroid therapy is an incorrect answer as studies have not confirmed an association between steroid treatment for acute exacerbations and an increased risk of congenital malformations.The next step, should her symptoms deteriorate, would be to increase her inhaled corticosteroid/add in a LABA – these would be done prior to commencing leukotrience inhibitors, which have limited safety data in pregnancy.Whilst poorly controlled, severe asthma does increase the risk of pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction, this has not been found in well controlled, mild asthmatics.Pregnancy is an ideal opportunity to educate (avoid trigger factors, review inhaler techniques, smoking cessation, safety of inhalers and steroids etc) women with a history of asthma."
female genital system,1891,"A 25-year-old presents with lower abdominal pain of 12 months duration. The pain is worse around her menses, which are also heavy. Sexual intercourse is painful. She has altered bowel habits especially around menstruation. You suspect that she may have either irritable bowel syndrome or endometriosis or both. What approach will you take to differentiate between the two conditions?",Three months on the combined oral contraceptive pill,Assessment of visceral hypersensitivity,Diagnostic laparoscopy,Ultrasound of the pelvis (transvaginal),Bowel endoscopy,A,"Approximately 40% of women with endometriosis also have irritablebowel syndrome (IBS). Patients with IBS and endometriosis both have visceral hypersensitivity and endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract has not been found to be useful in diagnosing IBS but beneficial in excluding bowel pathology that may be a differential. Although a diagnostic laparoscopy will identify most cases of endometriosis, a negative laparoscopy does not exclude the diagnosis. A therapeutic trial of ovarian suppression with the combined oral contraceptive pill or a GnRH agonist is therefore the most useful test to distinguish endometriosis from IBS."
female genital system,1892,"Regarding the human chromosomes, which of the following statements is correct?",Barr body is only found in people who are phenotypically female,The Y chromosome is larger than the X chromosome,Barr body is caused by the presence of an inactive X chromosome,There are 23 pairs of autosomal chromosomes,Cells containing YO chromosome are compatible with life,C,"During interphase chromosomes are too tenuous to be stained and seen by light microscopy. However, a dense, stainable structure, called a Barr body (after its discoverer) is seen in the interphase nuclei of female mammals. The Barr body is one of the X chromosomes. Its compact appearance reflects its inactivity.People with XXY or XXXY karyotypes are males (because of their Y chromosome), and display the features of Klinefelter's syndrome. The phenotypic effects of the extra X chromosomes are mild because, just as in females, the extra Xs are inactivated and converted into Barr bodies.No YO individuals have been identified, not even aborted fetuses. It has been suggested that there is something fundamental on the X chromosome that is needed for life.The Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome.There are 22 pairs of autosomes, and one pair of sex chromosomes."

female genital system,1896,Post-menopausal bleeding investigation- Pipelle inadequate. How much cancer remain undetected if Pipelle inadequate?,3%,5%,9%,15%,25%,B,"It was previously thought that the 30% of women with an inadequate sample could be safely reassured however, given that 4.5% of women were diagnosced with EC after an initial inadequate sample in one study, this might not be appropriate and emphasises the importance of restricting endometrial sampling to women with a thickened endometrium in the first place. While most women tolerate endometrial sampling well, pain is a significant barrier for some. Failed endometrial sampling is usually associated with pain or cervical stenosis, which are more common in nulliparous women. As a blind procedure, endometrial sampling has the potential to miss small, localised cancers. Women with benign or inconclusive histology, but persistent symptoms or suspicious ultrasound findings, should be offered hysteroscopy."

female genital system,1898,"A couple present to the fertility clinic after failing to conceive despite trying for 2.5 years. The semen analysis shows azoospermia.You perform a full examination of the male partner which reveals Height 192cm, BMI 20.5, small testes and scant facial hair. You decide to organise karyotyping. What is the result likely to show?",47XXX,46XY,47XYY,46XX,47XXY,E,The first 2 karyotypes represent normal male and female Karyotypes. 47XXX or triple X syndrome would be seen in females not males. 47XYY karyotypes affect around 1 in 1000 men but they have normal phenotypes. 47XXY is the Karyotype seen in Klinefelters. In the exam if you asked about Karyotypes associated with azoospermia and infertility it is highly likely they are alluding to Klinefelter's Syndrome. Other chromosomal abnormalities leading to azoospermia would be Cystic fibrosis (usually DeltaF508 mutation) or microdeletions of the Y-Chromosome.

In her first pregnancy 5 years ago she suffered a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) at 3 days postpartum. She was anticoagulated for with 3 months with warfarin. Her BMI is 25 (weight 65 kg) and she is a non smoker. What is the most appropriate management strategy for this pregnancy to prevent venous thromboembolism?,Compression stockings and good hydration,LMW heparin once daily now until 6 weeks postpartum,LMW heparin once daily commenced following delivery until 6 weeks postpartum,Thrombophilia screen and review in 2 weeks with results,LMW heparin 1 mg/kg twice daily now until 6 weeks postpartum,B,"In view of a previous VTE associated with pregnancy, antenatal and postnatal prophylaxis is indicated. A negative thrombophilia screen would not change management. A prophylactic dose should be sufficient. Hydration and compression stockings or postnatal prophylaxis alone would not be sufficient with a personal history of VTE associated with pregnancy as there is a high risk of recurrence. The RCOG recommends that if a woman has had one previous episode of VTE and has no other risk factors, she should be offered anti coagulation postpartum for 6 weeks. The RCOG states that ""it may be reasonable not to use antenatal thromboprophylaxis with heparin in women with a single previous VTE associated with a temporary risk factor that has now resolved"". However, in this case it was pregnancy associated so this does not apply."

This can be expressed as a fraction or decimal. For example if you have a risk of VTE of 1/1000 pregnancies this may be expressed as 0.001Relative risk is used to compare the risk in two different groups of people e.g. pregnant and non-pregnant women. If the risk of VTE in a healthy non-pregnant women is 2 per 10,000 vs 8-10 per 10,000 in pregnancy then the relative risk is 4 to 5 times (In large US studies figure works out at 4.3)Note Some sources such as SIGN quote relative risk of VTE in pregnancy as high as 10 fold that for non-pregnant patients. This is higher than the RCOG figure and may reflect the risk variation amongst those with other VTE risk factors e.g. age, smoking, obesity.Diagram illustrating Risk Factor stratification for VTE"

What is the diagnosis?,Prader willi syndrome,Asherman's syndrome,Kallmann syndrome,Turner syndrome,Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser syndrome,E,"This is describing MRKH syndrome which is sometimes known as Müllerian agenesis or uterovaginal agenesis as it is characterized by a failure of the Müllerian duct to develop resulting in a missing uterus and variable degrees of vaginal hypoplasia. Outflow Tract Disorders BackgroundThe urogenital system develops from intermediate mesothelium of the peritoneal cavity and the endoderm of the urogenital sinus. Incidence of congenital anomalies of the genital tract 3% Primarily abnormalities of uterine fusion with septate uteri constituting 90% of cases (uterine abnormalities are considered seperately)MRKH syndrome (uterovaginal agenesis)Incidence approximately 1:5000 female births Genetics not fully understood. Features result of Mullerian agenesis. Patients present as teenagers with primary amenorrhoea due to absent uterus and vagina. There are normal secondary sexual characteristics due to functioning ovaries. 40% have associated renal abnormality. Treatment typically involves psychological support and use of vaginal dilators to dilate the vaginal dimple to allow sexual intercourse. Surgical treatment is also an option.Imperforate HymenThin membrane that occurs at the junction of the sinovaginal bulb with the urogenital sinus Usually perforated during fetal life If remains imperforate then a haematocolpos (blood collection in the vagina proximal to the hymen) may form when menstruation occurs. Treatment involves a cruciate incision to relieve the obstruction. The hymen tissue can be excised or left.Transverse vaginal septumIncidence approximately 1:40,000 Presenting symptoms are typically increasing cyclical abdominal pain and absent menstruation. Haematocolpos and occasionally a small haematometra will form. Treatment involves the excision of the septum and end to end vaginal anastomosis. Vaginal mould for 10 days after surgery and use of vaginal dilators reduce the risk of stenosis. Pregnancy rates are: 100% with lower 1/3 obstruction, 40% with middle 1/3 and 20% with upper third.A=upper third septum, B = middle third septum, C = lower third septumLongitudinal vaginal septumThese fusion defects may occur in the presence of two hemi-uteri and two hemi- cervices. Each cervix fuses with the urogenital sinus to develop into two hemi-vaginas. Presents typically with difficulty inserting tampons, painful sexual intercourse or sometimes found during pregnancy. Can present with a mass if one hemi-vagina is blind ending and accumulates blood. The patient should still appear to have normal menses however as blood will flow via the other hemi-vagina. Excision of the septum is advised for improved chance of conception and to reduce complications with labour."

At colposcopy you note thin, smooth acetowhite lesions with well demarcated margins. She is keen to discuss management with you. Which of the following options is most suitable for her?",Large loop excision of the transformation zone,Punch biopsy,Knife cone biopsy,Laser cone biopsy,Hysterectomy,B,"Firstly, although it is ideal to refer to colposcopy, it is acceptable to repeat the smear within primary care priorto referral. Low grade CIN is often seen as thin, smooth acetowhite lesions with well demarcated, but irregular, feathery or digitating or angular margins. A punch biopsy will identify whether this is likely CIN 1 or something more sinister. In order to prevent progression to invasive disease, there is a general consensus that CIN 2 and CIN 3 should be treated. CIN 1 probably does not require immediate treatment, as it has a much lower malignant potential than the higher grades, and in many cases will resolve spontaneously. Approximately 50% of women with low grade cytological abnormality who are not treated at the first visit will eventually revert to normal cytology and colposcopy. With CIN 1, which has a low malignant potential and will usually resolve spontaneously, it is important to encourage the woman to quit smoking and if persistent may be treated (excision/ablation)."

Cytogenetic analysis should be performed on products of conception of the third and subsequent consecutive miscarriage(s). Parental peripheral blood karyotyping of both partners should be performed in couples with recurrent miscarriage where testing of products of conception reports an unbalanced structural chromosomal abnormality. Hyperprolactinaemia may cause subfertility rather than miscarriage. There is no evidence that gestational diabetes per se causes recurrent first trimester miscarriages. TORCH (Toxoplasmosis, Other, Rubella virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes simplex) infection would be unlikely to precipitate recurrent miscarriage.

Those effected typically aged between 32 and 38 15% of cases in women under 45 15% of cases in women under 30 associated with pregnancy or 1 year postpartumInvestigationUltrasound assessment of discrete lumps. If breast cancer confirmed mammography with fetal shielding required Cytology inconclusive in pregnancy - histological diagnosis required Investigation for staging not recommended unless high degree clinical suspicion (bone scanning, CT, pelvic XRAY and contrast enhanced MRI not advised) If performed CXR and liver USS advised.Treatment ConsiderationsSurgical treatment can be considered in all trimesters Systemic chemotherapy is contraindicated in 1st trimester (due to high rate of fetal abnormality). Safe from the second trimester. Radiotherapy contraindicated until after delivery (unless life saving/preserve function eg spinal cord compression) Tamoxifen and trastuzumab (herceptin®) are contraindicated in pregnancy Women should not breast feed if taking tamoxifen or trastuzumab (herceptin®) Breast feeding whilst on chemotherapy is not advised due to risk of neonatal leucopenia. Breast feeding should be delayed until 14 days after last chemotherapy dose.Planning pregnancy following breast cancerWomen taking tamoxifen should stop 3 months before trying to conceive. Women with metastatic disease should be advised against further pregnancyEffects on fertilityChemotherapy-induced gonadotoxicity may cause permanent amenorrhoea with complete loss of germ cells, transient amenorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and subfertility. Tamoxifen, GnRH analogues eg Zoladex (Goserelin) and trastuzumab (herceptin®) are not known to cause lasting subfertility though they are associated with menstrual irregularity whilst patients are taking them."

female genital system,2017,Select the single most appropriate statement with reference to abdominal incisions and preoperative preparations in a gynaecological surgery:,A scalpel should be changed after superficial incision for a deep incision.,Wound infection rates are less if no hair is removed as compared to depilatory preparation,Horizontal incisions cause minimum nerve damage,Vertical skin incisions have better cosmetic results and greater strength.,Preoperative showering with antiseptics reduces the infection rate to almost half.,E,"The advantages that transverse incisions offer are that they are less painful, have better cosmetic results, interfere less with postoperative respiration and have greater strength. The disadvantages being that there is greater blood loss and injury to nerves and muscle which can result in potential spaces with haematoma or seroma. Also, there is compromised view of upper abdominal cavity. Skin preparation is done before all surgical procedures. Preoperative showering with antiseptics reduces the infection rate in clean wound (1.3 % versus 2.3 %). Wound infection rate of 0.6 % is seen with depilatory preparation, as with procedure done with no hair removal.

female genital system,2025,In abruption where does the bleeding come from?,Vasa Previa,Placental lacunae,Succenturiate lobe,Uterine endothelium,Decidua basalis,E,"Placental abruption occurs when there is premature separation of a normally sited placenta. There are two potential mechanisms for placental abruption acute inflammation and chronic vascular dysfunction. Inflammatory processes are mediated by cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, which produce matrix metalloproteinases in trophoblast. The metalloproteinases cause destruction of extracellular matrices and disruption of cell-cell interactions, leading to premature detachment of the placenta.Bleeding begins in the decidua basalispnd leads to the separation of the placenta from its attachment to the uterine wall. This separation can be partial and self-limiting or can extend until there is fetal hypoxia and, ultimately, demise."

How to manage?,TVS us now,Subtotal Hysterectomy,MRI,Suction Evacuation,B-HCG,D,"Management of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease What circumstances should a repeat surgical removal be indicated and what is the timing?There is almost always a role for urgent surgical management for the woman who is experiencing heavy or persistent vaginal bleeding causing acute haemodynamic compromise, particularly in the presence of retained pregnancy tissue on ultrasound.Outside the context of acute compromise, there should be consultation with the relevant GTD referral center before performing surgical management for the second time in the same pregnancy.Women with persistent heavy vaginal bleeding and evidence of retained pregnancy tissue on ultrasound examination may need a repeat surgical removal. This remains true when a woman has had a prior surgical removal for suspected GTD. Expediting surgical management in the case of acute haemodynamic compromise is the priority and delay can be harmful. Consideration should be given to balloon tamponade and to uterine artery embolisation to reduce the risk of hysterectomy for women who wish to preserve fertility. Embolisation will not always stop the bleeding but will permit management of blood loss. Bleeding from vaginal metastases can be reduced by compression from a vaginal pack."

The USA reports incidence as high as 3 per 1000 Placenta Accreta Regarding abnormal placental invasion there are 3 forms (sometimes discussed together under the term Accreta):Accreta: chorionic villi attached to myometrium rather than decidua basalis Increta: chorionic villi invade into the myometrium. Percreta: chorionic villi invade through the myometriumAccreta is the most common form accounting for around 76% of cases, Increta is 2nd most common with 17% of cases and Percreta 7% of cases. Previous C-section is a risk factor with the risk rising with each c-section. Risk of placenta accreta was 3%, 11%, 40%, 61%, and 67% for the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth or greater repeat cesarean deliveries, respectively. Placenta praevia is also a risk factor. Additional reported risk factors for placenta accreta include maternal age and multiparity, other prior uterine surgery, prior uterine curettage, uterine irradiation,endometrial ablation, Asherman syndrome, uterine leiomyomata, uterine anomalies, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and smoking."

female genital system,2070,24 female developed oligomenorrhea and hirsutism. Investigation shows normal FSH and LH. Testosterone 6. high 17- hydroxyprogesterone. How to confirm the diagnosis?,CT pelvis,ACTH stimulation test,"FSH, LH and testosterone",Prolactin,17 hydroxyprogesterone,B,"Congenital adrenal hyperpla CAH is a group of autosomal recessive disorders, each of which involves a deficiency of one of five enzymes involved in the synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal cortex. In CAH insufficient cortisol is produced. which stimulates hypothalamic CRH secretion, due to the absence of normal feedback inhibitionThis leads to chronically elevated adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which in turn stimulates the adrenal gland to become hyperplastic with excess androgen hormones and steroid precursors being produced and secrcted from the normally functioning metabolic pathways. The most common form of CAH is due to a deficiency of 21-hydroxylase activity, which accounts for 90-95% of cases of CAH It is associated with a wide range of clinical effects and severity can vary depending on the mutation.Classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency commonly presents in infancy. Female infants can be severely virilised leading to ambiguous genitalia. Salt wasting and adrenal crises can occur in some patients and are important causes of neonatal death. Non-classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency tends to present in puberty or later in adult life. In this condition, the mutated enzymes in the cortisol biosynthetic pathways maintain 20- 60% of normal function.Typical patients have features of hyperandrogenism but have preserved cortisol and aldosterone production, so salt wasting and adrenal crises are not common features of this condition.Many female patients can present in early adulthood with menstrual - disturbance or hirsutism. Affected males and at females may exhibit precocious puberty with tall stature pubarche, advanced bone age with early epiphyseal fusion, infertility and severe acne, which is refractory to treatment.Clinical features/associated with hyperandrogenism:-Height, weight and body mass index-Distribution and extent of adiposity-Skin thinning or bruising (seen in Cushing’s syndrome)-Acne, especially over the face, neck, back and chest-Degree, pattern and severity of hirsutism-Acanthosis nigricans (velvety skin hyperpigmentation), associated with insulin resistance-Deepened voice,-Male pattern balding-Breast atrophy-Clitoromegaly-Loss of normal feminine body shape"

She should be advised to which of the following ?,"Stop taking cabergoline and swap to bromocriptine, which has a better safety profile",Stop taking cabergoline because there are rare reports of serious congenital abnormalies associated with its use followed by close surveillance with blood tests and MRI,Stop taking cabergoline although it is most likely safe in early pregnancy. No further follow up unless she becomes symptomatic,Stop taking cabergoline although it is most likely safe in early pregnancy. No further follow up monthly,"Stop taking cabergoline although this is most likely safe in early pregnancy, followed by close surveillance with blood tests and MRI",C,"Only 3% of women with a microadenoma will experience symptomatic enlargement of their adenoma during pregnancy. Once pregnancy is confirmed, dopamine agonists should be stopped. Prolactin levels are unhelpful in monitoring tumour activity as they are normally high during pregnancy. MRI or visual field testing is required if the woman becomes symptomatic. Serum prolactin levels should be rechecked a few weeks after cessation of breastfeeding you should also perform an MRI of the pituitary to assess tumour enlargement if prolactin levels are higher than prepregnancy levels.Bromocriptine and cabergoline are probably safe in early pregnancy with no increased risk of fetal loss or congenital abnormalities. There is more data on the safety of bromocriptine in pregnancy and it is, therefore, the treatment of choice at present. Cabergoline is not licensed in pregnancy however, it is not always necessary to change to bromocriptine during pregnancy if the woman is already on cabergoline pre-pregnancy. Long term use (over 1 year) has been associated with heart valve fibrosis and surveillance with echocardiography is advisable if long term treatment is being considered."

Doses of 0.01 mg, 0.05mg and 0.1 mg are too small for therapeutic effect in circulatory collapse by im route and would be more appropriate doses for iv route. 10mg is too large for an initial dose but if there is a suboptimal response to initial dose, then injections should be repeated every 10 minutes and may therefore reach an accumulative dose of 10 mg."
female genital system,2078,"A 43‐year‐old woman is admitted acutely at 33 weeks gestation. She describes heavy PV blood loss and lower abdominal pains for the last two hours. The placenta is not low lying and she is rhesus D positive. Examination reveals a firm tender abdomen with palpable contractions 3‐4:10, a moderate amount of active bleeding through the (closed) cervical os, and no evidence of upper genital tract bleeding point. CTG monitoring reveals a sinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern for 30 minutes, with no accelerations. What is the most appropriate management option?",Steroid administration ‐ 2 doses 24 hours apart,Induction of labour with prostaglandin pessary,Tocolysis,Steroid administration ‐ 2 doses 24 hours apart with tocolytic cover,Urgent delivery by Caesarean section,E,"This woman has had a significant antepartum haemorrhage, likely due to placental abruption.A sinusoidal CTG pattern is associated with severe fetal anaemia and therefore indicative of severe fetal compromise. Urgent delivery is indicated for fetal well‐being, with induction of labour being far too long a process to undertake with the suspicion of fetal compromise.Prior to delivery a single dose of betamethasone may give some benefit to fetal respiratory function, however the indication is too urgent to allow a full course to be given. Tocolysis is contraindicated in the presence of antepartum haemorrhage."

Clinical examination and CXR reveals a pleural effusion and malignancy is suspected as an underlying cause. Tumour markers are requested as part of the work up. Investigation shows:    CA 15-3 9 U/ml (less than 40)   CA 19-9 60 U/ml (less than 33)   CA 125 620 U/ml (less than 35)    Which of the following diagnoses is the most likely?",Breast cancer,Ovarian fibroma,Ovarian cancer,Pancreatic cancer,Small cell lung cancer,C,"The combination of raised CA 125, pleural effusion and history suggestive of malignancy makes the diagnosis of ovarian cancer the most likely of those listed. An ovarian fibroma with a pleural effusion (Meigs' syndrome) is a possibility, but you would not expect the CA 125 to be so raised, or the patient to feel so unwell. The mechanism of development of the pleural effusion is thought to be through the development of ascites, which than transudates through the transdiaphragmatic lymphatics into the right pleural cavity. CA 15-3 is a tumour marker for breast cancer. CA 19-9 is a pancreatic cancer marker. As all other tumour markers, it is not 100% specific and therefore can be raised even in the absence of pancreatic carcinoma. Clearly it is raised in this case, and this would make you want to exclude pancreatic carcinoma on clinical, radiological and histological grounds but the markedly raised CA 125 with the clinical signs make ovarian carcinoma more likely in this case.

female genital system,2080,Which of the following is a primary site of Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production?,Hypothalamus,Ductus Venosus,Corpus Luteum,Placenta,Maternal liver,D,Prostaglandins are produced in almost all nucleated cells. The placenta and ductus arteriosus in particular have high quantities of the COX enzyme isoforms required for synthesis of PGE2. Ductus arteriosus The most important chemical for maintaining a patent DA during pregnancy is PGE2. Following delivery there are several mechanisms that lead to ductus constrictionIncrease in arterial PO2 Decrease in blood pressure within the ductus lumen due to the postnatal decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance. Decrease in PGE2 due to the loss of placental PGE2 production Decrease in the number of PGE2 receptors in the ductus wall Some texts suggest Oxytocin also plays a role The ductus arteriosus typically closes 1-2 days after delivery
female genital system,2081,A 23-year-old woman is being followed up 6 weeks after a surgical procedure to evacuate the uterus following a miscarriage. The histology has shown changes consistent with a hydatidiform mole. What is the single most appropriate investigatigation in this case?,Abdominal US,Maternal karyotype,Paternal blood group,Serum B-HCG,Transvaginal US,D,"When you are first diagnosed with a hydatidiform mole, your hCG level will be raised. When the hydatidiform mole is treated (removed), the hCG level will usually return to a normal, non-pregnant amount and should remain so. If you develop GTN (gestational trophoblastic neoplasia), the hCG level can remain elevated or continue to rise further. So, this blood test is a good way to check for the possible development of GTN (Gestational trophoblastic neoplasia)"

The scan reports twin 1 to have a normal abdominal circumference, normal liquor volume and Doppler studies. Twin 2 has undergone fetal demise. What is the most appropriate management?",Delivery of twin 1,Referral to fetal medicine unit,Continuing the pregnancy but deliver twin 1 if further complications develop,MRI of surviving twin,Conservative management of the pregnancy,B,"It should be recognised that the risk of fetal death is not restricted to monochorionic pregnancies with a prior diagnosis of TTTS. When one monochorionic twin dies in utero, there is an 18% chance of necrotic neurological and renal lesions in the survivor and a 12% risk of intrauterine death in the initially healthy co twin. Management depends upon the gestation and time lapsed since fetal demise. Clinical management is complex and is best overseen by fetal medicine experts with knowledge and experience to advise on the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches.Rapid delivery is usually unwise unless there are significant cardiotocographic abnormalities. Detailed counselling is essential and needs to be recorded in the notes. Serious compromise in the surviving twin should be anticipated and should be discussed with the parents, including long term morbidity. A conservative policy is usually appropriate with brain imaging in 4 weeks time to establish if serious morbidity has occurred in the surviving twin."

female genital system,2108,"A woman who has just had her midtrimester anomaly scan returns to the antenatal clinic to discuss the results. On the scan it is stated that there is complete anhydramnios. The fetus is in a flexed breech presentation. Neither kidney could be identified on the scan with no evidence of renal arteries on colour flow Doppler bilaterally. Within the limitations of the scan, the rest of the fetal anatomy appears normal and biometry supports a gestation of 20 weeks. The woman states that there is no history of leaking per vagina. What is the most appropriate course of action to take antenatally?",Refer the woman to antenatal triage for a sterile speculum examination to exclude preterm rupture of membranes,Counsel the woman that the scan findings are incompatible with life and offer termination of pregnancy as one possible option,Offer a further scan at 28 weeks of gestation to confirm the diagnosis as the oligohydramnios may be transient,Discharge the woman back to midwife led care,Offer amniocentesis to exclude an underlying chromosomal abnormality,B,"The findings are diagnostic of bilateral renal agenesis and this condition is incompatible with life. As the fetus does not produce urine there is complete anhydramnios and associated lung hypoplasia. Termination of pregnancy can be offered on the basis of this.

Which of the statements is true?,Approximately 40% of deliveries will be preterm,Rate of congenital malformation is higher in those with SCI above T10 level than the general population,Higher frequency of breech or transverse lie in patients with SCI above T10 level than in the general population,Caesarean section is the preferred mode of delivery for patients with SCI above T10,Rate of stillbirth is higher in those with SCI above T10 level than the general population,C,"There is a higher frequency of breech or transverse lie in patients with SCI There is a higher frequency of breech or transverse lie in patients with SCI above T10 level than in the general population, The reason for this is unknown.Stillbirth and congenital malformation rates are similar in patients with SCI and the general population. Preterm delivery is thought to effect around 15% of births and is comparable to rates seen in most Northern European countries.Vaginal delivery is the preferred mode of delivery. One criticism of antenatal care in women with SCI has been the liberal use of caesarean section. In women with SCI below T5 being treated in specialist centres c-section rates are typically 25-30%. Pregnancy and spinal cord injury Pregnancy and spinal cord injury (SCI) Key PointsWomen with lesions above T6 and T10 need special consideration (see below) All women with SCI are at high risk of pressure ulcers, anaemia and UTI Rate of stillbirths and congenital malformation is not increased when conceiving after spinal cord injury Pregnancy limits mobility further in 4.5% of women with SCI If SCI occurred at a young age, or was associated with pelvic trauma, clinical pelvimetry should be performed Vaginal birth is the usual mode of delivery in women with SCIRisks with lesions above T6Bradycardia Hypotension Autonomic dysreflexia (AD) - hypertension, bradycardia, headache, flushing Respiratory muscles may be affected Spirometry checked if vital capacity (VC)Susceptible to autonomic dysreflexia (AD) and spasms (see below) A rise in systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 20-40 mmHg above baseline is considered a sign of ADRisks with lesions above T10Perception of fetal movements is altered Perception of uterine contractions is altered Higher frequency of breech or transverse lie, especially in lesions above T10Autonomic dysreflexiaRefers to an uninhibited sympathetic nervous system response.

female genital system,2134,A 28 year old woman who is 32 weeks gestation is reviewed in clinic due to pruritus. A serum bile acid concentration is taken and is reported as 118 micromol/L. This is most consistent with which of the following diagnoses?,Severe intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Moderate intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Mild intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Gestational pruritis,Psychosomatic pruritus,A,"Bile acid concentrations above 100 micromol/L are most consistent with severe intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy Diagnosis & classificationThere is no single diagnostic test for ICP but the diagnosis should be considered in pregnant women who have pruritus, normal skin appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more.Onset is typically in the third trimester. The diagnosis is more likely if it is confirmed that itching and raised bile acids resolve after birth.Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is classed according to peak bile acid levels as shown in the table below:Severity Peak bile acid concentrationMild 19–39 micromol/LModerate 40–99 micromol/LSevere 100 micromol/L or morePrevalenceIn the UK, ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, and 1.2%–1.5% of women of Indian-Asian or Pakistani-Asian originRisksStillbirth is the major concern for pregnant people with ICP. Data suggests that for singleton pregnancies the stillbirth rate is only significantly increased above background rate in those with severe ICP (3.44% vs 0.29%).In twin and multipe pregnancy there appears to be a significant increased risk of stillbirth in pregnant women with ICP compared to those without ICP even if ICP is mild or moderate. For singleton pregnancy:In women with peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L and no other risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk.In women with peak bile acids 40–99 micromol/L and no other risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk until 38–39 weeks' gestation.In women with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is higher than the background riskModerate or severe ICP also carries the following risks:Both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth Meconium stained amniotic fluid during labour and birth More likely to receive neonatal careInvestigationsAdditional laboratory and/or imaging investigations are not recommended unless itch is associated with atypical clinical symptoms, the presence of relevant co-morbidities, or in early onset severe ICP Note this is a change in policy from the RCOG as of 2022 following a retrospective review of 500 women with pruritus and raised bile acid concentrations found no new diagnoses following viral, autoimmune and ultrasound investigations.Given that the likelihood of identifying a viral, autoimmune, or structural cause for the itching and liver derangement that was not suspected on other clinical grounds is extremely low these tests are no longer advised. MonitoringMonitoring is typically via repeat bile acid concentration and liver function tests. Fetal ultrasound and/or cardiotocography (CTG) do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.It is advised patients are monitored in a consultant led clinic given the increased risk of complications.All women should have a repeat bile acid level and liver function tests 1 week after initial test. The timing and frequency after that is down to clinical judgement. The RCOG suggest the following:If the woman has mild ICP with peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L, they could have weekly testing as they approach 38 weeks' gestation in order to inform timing of birth. If the woman has moderate ICP with peak bile acid 40–99 micromol/L, especially if they are approaching 35 weeks' gestation, weekly testing should be considered, as timing of birth may be influenced if levels rise to 100 micromol/L or more. If the woman has severe ICP with peak bile acid 100 micromol/L or more, further routine testing of bile acids might not impact on decision making and therefore may not be routinely requiredManagementAdvise women that there are no treatments that improve pregnancy outcome (or raised bile acid concentrations) and treatments to improve maternal itching are of limited benefit.Timing of birthPatient type Birth timingMild ICPNo other risk factors Consider options of planned birth by 40 weeksModerate ICPNo other risk factors Consider planned birth at 38–39 weeks' gestationSevere ICP Consider planned birth at 35–36 weeks' gestationWomen with one or more of the following additional risk factors warrant consultant review to plan timing of birth:Gestational diabetes Pre-eclampsia Multifetal pregnancyWomen with severe ICP should be offered continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) during delivery"

The site, extent and timing of the repair of the injury will determine the presentation, management and outcome.Injuries that are recognised at the time of damage are associated with good outcomes high morbidity or even mortality are associated with delay in presenting late with peritonism. However, the majority of the injuries are recognised intraoperatively.In the case of bowel damage that is recognised intraoperatively, a bowel surgeon should be involved as it takes considerable experience to decide whether simply oversewing a partial or full thickness injury is appropriate, or whether the safer course would be local resection and reanastomosis.Patients who sustain a minor laceration such as puncture with the Veress needle may not have any problems.

It wouldn't be appropriate to manage a patient with acute appendicitis by monitoring serial CRP's.An abdominal XRAY is not a sensitive test for appendicitis. Although abdominal CT would be a reasonable test in a non-pregnant patient they are not typically used in pregnancy due to the radiation risk to the fetus.The American College of Radiology advises MRI be used if ultrasound is inconclusive. Appendicitis in Pregnancy Appendicitis in pregnancy key pointsAppendicitis is common in pregnancy The most common cause of an acute surgical abdomen in pregnancy Most commonly presents in the second trimester Classic presentation is of central abdominal pain that localises to the right iliac fossa. This is frequently associated with fever, nausea, diarrhoea and urinary symptoms.ImagingIf the diagnosis is clear and/or the patient has abdominal pain and is haemodynamically compromised requiring laparoscopy/laprotomy the clinician should proceed to take the patient to theatre.

They were advised at the anomaly scan last week they are having a girl. The couples 18 month old son has just been diagnosed with Haemophilia B. Neither parent is affected by the condition and they have not undergone genetic testing yet. They ask what the risk is that their unborn baby girl will have haemophilia B?,1 in 8,1 in 4,1 in 2,1 in 1,zero,E,Female offspring can only be affected by an X-linked recessive disease if their father is affected and mother is a carrier or affected haemophilia A and B are X-linked recessive diseases.As the father is unaffected he does not have an affected X chromosome and so this couples female offspring will have one 'normal' or unaffected X chromosome from the paternal side. The daughter cannot be affected as this is a recessive condition.The fact the mother doesn't have the disease but the son does tells you she must carry the gene and there is a risk that the girl will be a carrier as per the diagram below. X linked Recessive Disorders X-linked recessive disorders tend to affect males and are very rare in females as men only have one X chromosome thus should they inherit one copy of the mutation they will express the affected phenotype whereas women with one mutated X chromosome will be unaffected carriers.The inheritance pattern is illustrated below.There are a number important conditions that exhibit this mode of inheritance:Red-green color blindness Haemophilia A Haemophilia B Duchenne muscular dystrophy X-linked ichthyosis X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency

Neuropsychiatric conditions including non-epileptic attack disorder should also be considered.Imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerised tomography (CT) scans are considered safe in pregnancy to assess women presenting with seizures.The risk to the fetus from a single exposure is minimal.If there is doubt whether the seizure is secondary to epilepsy or eclampsia, magnesium sulfate, which is the drug of choice for the treatment of eclamptic seizures, should be administered until a definitive diagnosis is made.The other differential diagnoses for seizures in pregnancy include cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, posterior reversible leucoencephalopathy syndrome, space-occupying lesions and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome. Other conditions, such as syncope associated with cardiac arrhythmia, aortic stenosis, carotid sinus sensitivity, vasovagal syncope and metabolic conditions such as hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia and Addisonian crisis will need to be ruled out for first presentation of seizures in pregnancy.Non-epileptic attack disorder, also referred to as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, dissociative seizures or pseudoseizures, forms an important differential diagnosis in individuals with drug-resistant attacks.

There are obviously caveats where it may be deemed appropriate for a patient with a UKMEC 3 condition to use the COCP and those with multiple UKMEC 2 conditions being deemed unsuitable.COCP UKMEC 4 conditions:Age ≥ 35 and smoking ≥15 cigarettes/day Systolic BP ≥160mmHg Diastolic BP ≥100mmHg Vascular disease Ischaemic heart disease Stroke History VTE VTE currently being treated with antioagulants Major surgery with prolonged immobilisation Known thrombogenic mutations eg factor V Leiden Complicated valvular heart disease eg history SBE, tetralogy of Fallot, aortic stenosis.

female genital system,2228,Which one of the following has the most significant effect on slowing drug metabolism in pregnancy?,Progesterone effect on gastric motility,Dilutional anaemia,Increased renal blood flow,Increased hepatic blood flow,Lower albumin concentration,A,Lower albumin levels mean a greater unbound drug fraction but as this may be thought to increase drug concentrations it actually leaves more available for hepatic clearance or renal excretion so overall drug concentrations are unchanged and metabolism increased. Increased renal blood flow means renally excreted drugs are cleared faster. There are many changes to hepatic physiology which means overall some drugs are cleared faster and some slower. The effect of increased hepatic blood flow alone results in faster hepatic clearance. Dilutional anaemia is due to increased body water in respect to haemaglobin. Drug concentrations equally will be diluted. Progesterone down regulates gastric motility meaning drugs are absorbed and metabolised more slowly.

What would be the best modality to confirm or exclude this finding?,Intravenous urogram,Ultrasound KUB,Cystourethroscopy,Micturating cystogram,CT urogram,C,"Ultrasound KUB is not a sensitive imaging technique to identify bladder injury. It is a good modality to diagnose hydronephrosis, large bladder or kidney lesions. However, some tertiary centres can identify the position of synthetic mid urethral slings using transperineal ultrasound. There is limited experience with this technique hence it is not a standard modality used in most centres.Micturating cystogram can be used to identify bladder injury however the perforated site might be very small to be detected on imaging.Intravenous urogram or IVU is best used to identify anatomical anomaliesand calculi.A CT urogram is a modality which can be considered, however the risk of radiation and contrast exposure as well as cost effectiveness to identify a small perforation must be taken into account.Cystourethroscopy under local or general anaesthesia should be carriedout. A repair by an experienced surgeon could be done at the same time."

female genital system,2246,A patient is referred to the fertility clinic by her GP. Whilst you are explaining her blood results the patient admits she has been using the combined oral contraceptive pill intermittently but had told her GP she hadn't had any contraception in the past 12 months. Which of the following accurately reflects the effects of the COCP on a patients hormone profile?,"AMH increased, FSH decreased, LH decreased","FSH decreased, LH increased, E2 decreased","FSH decreased, LH decreased, E2 decreased","FSH increased, LH decreased, E2 decreased","AMH unchanged, FSH decreased, E2 increased",C,"Both biochemical and ultrasound markers can be used to measure ovarian reserve. COCP's have been shown to effect both of these. Serum FSH, LH and E2 levels are significantly lower in those taking COCPs AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) levels are not significantly changed between the two groups. Studies have also shown ultrasound changes with antral follicle development beyond 6 mm reduced in those on COCPs.COCPs work by both progesterone and oestrogen negative feedback. Progesterone negative feedback results in decreasing the frequency of GnRH release and a subsequent drop in FSH and LH. Decreased follicle development from a lower FSH results in reduced E2 production. Oestragen negative feedback also decreases FSH production.

OHSS Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome (OHSS) Key PointsOHSS is a condition which can effect women taking fertility medication where there is an excessive ovarian response to gonadotrophin therapy resulting in ovarian enlargement. There isn't a widely accepted classification system. Traditionally OHSS has been graded as mild, moderate or severe. The proposed RCOG system is shown below Overstimulated ovaries enlarge and release proinflammatry mediators into the bloodstream. The resulting increased vascular permeability leads to fluid loss from the intravascular compartment and is the reason patients can develop ascites and effusions. In severe OHSS significant hypovolaemia can ensue. Changes in fluid distribution and vascular permeability lead to a host of other biochemical disturbances that can result in prothombotic tendency (VTE), electrolyte disturbance inc hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia, nausea and tissue oedema.OHSSTrue incidence unknown With conventional IVF estimates mild OHSS with 1 in 3 cycles.

female genital system,2320,A couple have been referred to clinic. The male partner has haemophilia A. The mother does not have the disease. He wants to know the risk of passing his haemophilia gene to their unborn son. What is the risk?,1 in 8,1 in 4,1 in 2,1 in 1,zero,E,Males cannot pass on X-linked recessive disorders to male offspring The risk of a baby boy inheriting haemophilia from his father is zero. The reason being is that for this couple to have a baby boy the fathers Y chromosome will need to be inherited for him to have an XY genotype i.e male. The X chromosome will be provided by the mother X linked Recessive Disorders X-linked recessive disorders tend to affect males and are very rare in females as men only have one X chromosome thus should they inherit one copy of the mutation they will express the affected phenotype whereas women with one mutated X chromosome will be unaffected carriers.The inheritance pattern is illustrated below.There are a number important conditions that exhibit this mode of inheritance:Red-green color blindness Haemophilia A Haemophilia B Duchenne muscular dystrophy X-linked ichthyosis X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency

Aspirin in the management of Pre-eclampsia BackgroundPre-eclampsia effects approximately 3% of pregnancies Significant cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality Data suggests aspirin is safe to use in pregnancy with negligible adverse outcomes Data shows Aspirin treatment associated with 17% reduction in developing pre-eclampsia when used in at risk groups. Ongoing research into 1st trimester screening for pre-eclampsia using combination of clinical history, mean arterial blood pressure, uterine artery doppler studies and placental biomarkers to calculate maternal risk. This has not been adopted by NICE at this stageAspirin mechanism of actionInhibits cyclooxygenase isoenzymes COX1 and COX2 Blocks the formation of thromboxane A2 (which promotes platelet aggregation) in platelets Also blocks prostacylin formation (which inhibits platelet aggregation) in endothelial cells. As platelets lack a cell nucleus they cannot upregulate thromboxane production whereas endothelial cells can. Hence the overall effect of aspirin is one of inhibiting platelet aggregationNICE advice on Aspirin in Pre-eclampsiaWomen with more than one moderate risk factor or one high risk factor for pre-eclampsia should be advised to take 75-150 mg of aspirin daily from 12 weeks until the birth of the babyHigh risk factors:hypertensive disease during a previous pregnancy chronic kidney disease autoimmune disease such as systemic lupus erythematosis or antiphospholipid syndrome type 1 or type 2 diabetes chronic hypertension.Moderate risk factors:first pregnancy age 40 years or older pregnancy interval of more than 10 years body mass index (BMI) of 35 kg/m² or more at first visit family history of pre-eclampsia multiple pregnancy"

She has dilated from 4cm to 6cm in 4 hours. At your initial assessment she is 6cm dilated with membranes intact. You review her again 2 hours later and the cervix is now 6.5cm dilated with membranes in tact. What is the most appropriate management?,Advise C-section delivery,Review again in 1 hour,Administer prostaglandins,Advise amniotomy,Administer oxytocin,D,"In first labours delay is typically diagnosed if cervical dilatation is less than 2 cm dilatation in 4 hours so this patients progress at initial assessment is borderline. If delay is suspected NICE guidance advises a women should have a repeat vaginal examination 2 hours later and delay should be diagnosed if there is less than 1cm progress. In this case it fits the criteria of delay as she has only dilated 0.5cm in 2 hours.Amniotomy should be advised if delay is confirmed as is the case here. There is little evidence for amniotomy (AKA ARM - Artificial Rupture of Membranes) in any other circumstance apart from delayed labour progress. It shouldn't be used routinely in labour that is progressing well. The evidence behind its use in placental abruption is weak.

Here, cytotrophoblasts proliferate and spread laterally toform a cytotrophoblastic shell, splitting the syncytiotrophoblast into a definitive syncytiotrophoblast on the fetal sideand the peripheral syncytium on the decidual side which degenerates and is replaced by fibrinoid material (Nitabuchlayer)• Sprouts extend from primary villous stems, initially made up of syncytiotrophoblast and then infiltrated bycytotrophoblast and mesenchyme - these are primary stem villi and the placenta is a true villous structure by day 21of gestation. These villi grow and divide into secondary, tertiary and terminal villi• The villi oriented towards the uterine cavity degenerate between day 21 and the 4th month to form the chorion laeveThe overlying decidua degenerates and the chorion laeve comes in contact with the deciduas of the opposite uterinewall• The rest of the villi form the chorion frondosum which develops into the definitive placenta• Division and modification of the villous tree continues until term. First trimester villi are larger, have a complete layerof cytotrophoblasts and have a loose mysenchymal core which is vascularised towards the end of the first trimester• At term, the villi are smaller, cytotrophoblasts are few in number, the syncytiotrophoblast is irregularly thinned. Fetalvessels are sinusoidal and occupy most of the villous core and lie close to the syncytiotrophoblast, formingvasculusyncytial membranes which maximise materno-fetal transfer.• Sometimes, the syncytiotrophoblast nuclei appear in clusters called syncytial knots - more common in placentas fromIUGR / pre-eclamptic pregnancies• Maternal blood is separated from fetal blood by the syncytiotrophoblast and the fetal capillary endothelium"

Among FDA category B NAs, tenofovir is preferred because of its high potency, high genetic barrier and available safety data in pregnancy.The prevention of HBV perinatal transmission, which is considered to occur mainly at delivery, is traditionally based on the combination of passive and active immunisation with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and HBV vaccination. Such a strategy, however, may not be effective in a proportion of newborns from highly viremic (serum HBV DNA >106–7 IU/ml), mostly HBeAg-positive, mothers, who carry a >10 % risk of vertical HBV transmission despite HBIg and vaccination. Mothers with these high concentrations of HBV DNA should be informed that utilising a NA to reduce their viral loads could add to the effectiveness of HBIg and vaccination. Lamivudine and recently telbivudine therapy during the last trimester of pregnancy in pregnant HBsAg-positive women with high levels of viremia have been shown to be safe and to reduce the risk of intrauterine and perinatal transmission of HBV if given in addition to passive and active vaccination by HBIg and HBV vaccination. Thus, telbivudine, lamivudine or tenofovir (as a potent FDA category B agent) may be used for the prevention of perinatal and intrauterine HBV transmission in the last trimester of pregnancy in HBsAg-positive women with high levels of viremia (serum HBV DNA >106–7 IU/ml). No controlled clinical trial of tenofovir to prevent perinatal transmission has been conducted. If NA therapy is given only for the prevention of perinatal transmission, it may be discontinued within the fi rst 3 months after delivery."

However, current guidelines suggest that the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes may be reduced with active management, including pharmacotherapy, antenatal fetal monitoring and elective early delivery.Pharmacological managementICP is commonly treated with UDCA, which is a hydrophilic bile acid present in trace amounts in normal human serum.The mechanism of action for UDCA is not fully understood however, it decreases the level of bile acids in maternal and umbilical cord serum, and causes qualitative changes in the serum bile acid pool, with a consequent reduction in the hydrophobicity of the pool. Given that not all women treated with UDCA have biochemical or symptomatic improvement, a second-line treatmentis sometimes considered. Rifampicin is a choleretic antibiotic that has been shown to reduce pruritus and enhance bile acid excretion in primary biliary cirthosis when used in conjunction with UDCA.It has been widely used in pregnancy as an anti-tuberculous agent and, therefore, has good safety data. A 2015 study has reported UDCA and rifampicin dual therapy in women with ICP, and demonstrated a reduction of serum bile acids in 50% of the women treated.Women treated with rifampicin should be warned that it alters the colour of urine and tears. It is advisable to ensure that derangement in liver transaminase is not marked prior to commencing rifampicin treatment, as administration of the drug is associated with hepatic impairment.Other drugs, including cholestyramine and S-adenosy methionine, are not as effective as UDCA in reducing serum bile acid levels or improving pruritus and arc therefore no longer considered as first-line treatments in ICP"

You do not have gonadotrophin levels to make a decision on the appropriateness of treating for hypogonadism with gonadotrophins in this case. Testing for sperm antibodies and subsequent treatment with corticosteroids is not advocated by NICE.In terms of oligospermia you should repeat his sperm count. The timing depends on the severity of the oligospermia. In severe oligospermia a repeat sample should be done as soon as possible. In mild and moderate oligospermia a repeat should be perfomed after 3 months to allow time for the cycle of spermatozoa formation to be completed.Oligospermia is defined as a sperm count Severe oligospermia is defined as a sperm countSemen Analysis The NICE quality standard [QS73] sets out reference ranges for semen analysis using the WHO guideline.

female genital system,2400,You review a 26 year old woman in the antenatal clinic who complains of generalised itching. You suspect intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy. Which of the following statements regarding intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is correct?,Onset is typically in the first trimester,Ursodeoxycholic acid reduces the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes,There is an increased risk of preterm birth in moderate and severe ICP,"In the UK, ICP affects 2-3% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations",Serial cardiotocography is the gold standard tool to predict the likelihood of stillbirth,C,"There is an increased risk of both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth in moderate and severe ICP.Onset is typically in the third trimester. Fetal ultrasound and/or cardiotocography (CTG) do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP. Evidence from randomised controlled trials shows that there is no reduction in adverse perinatal outcomes in women prescribed ursodeoxycholic acid, compared to women in the placebo group. In the UK, ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy Diagnosis & classificationThere is no single diagnostic test for ICP but the diagnosis should be considered in pregnant women who have pruritus, normal skin appearance and raised peak random total bile acid concentration of 19 micromol/L or more.Onset is typically in the third trimester. The diagnosis is more likely if it is confirmed that itching and raised bile acids resolve after birth.Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is classed according to peak bile acid levels as shown in the table below:Severity Peak bile acid concentrationMild 19–39 micromol/LModerate 40–99 micromol/LSevere 100 micromol/L or morePrevalenceIn the UK, ICP affects 0.7% of pregnancies in multi-ethnic populations, and 1.2%–1.5% of women of Indian-Asian or Pakistani-Asian originRisksStillbirth is the major concern for pregnant people with ICP. Data suggests that for singleton pregnancies the stillbirth rate is only significantly increased above background rate in those with severe ICP (3.44% vs 0.29%).In twin and multipe pregnancy there appears to be a significant increased risk of stillbirth in pregnant women with ICP compared to those without ICP even if ICP is mild or moderate. For singleton pregnancy:In women with peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L and no other risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk.In women with peak bile acids 40–99 micromol/L and no other risk factors, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is similar to the background risk until 38–39 weeks' gestation.In women with peak bile acids 100 micromol/L or more, advise them that the risk of stillbirth is higher than the background riskModerate or severe ICP also carries the following risks:Both spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm birth Meconium stained amniotic fluid during labour and birth More likely to receive neonatal careInvestigationsAdditional laboratory and/or imaging investigations are not recommended unless itch is associated with atypical clinical symptoms, the presence of relevant co-morbidities, or in early onset severe ICP Note this is a change in policy from the RCOG as of 2022 following a retrospective review of 500 women with pruritus and raised bile acid concentrations found no new diagnoses following viral, autoimmune and ultrasound investigations.Given that the likelihood of identifying a viral, autoimmune, or structural cause for the itching and liver derangement that was not suspected on other clinical grounds is extremely low these tests are no longer advised. MonitoringMonitoring is typically via repeat bile acid concentration and liver function tests. Fetal ultrasound and/or cardiotocography (CTG) do not predict or prevent stillbirth in ICP.It is advised patients are monitored in a consultant led clinic given the increased risk of complications.All women should have a repeat bile acid level and liver function tests 1 week after initial test. The timing and frequency after that is down to clinical judgement. The RCOG suggest the following:If the woman has mild ICP with peak bile acids 19–39 micromol/L, they could have weekly testing as they approach 38 weeks' gestation in order to inform timing of birth. If the woman has moderate ICP with peak bile acid 40–99 micromol/L, especially if they are approaching 35 weeks' gestation, weekly testing should be considered, as timing of birth may be influenced if levels rise to 100 micromol/L or more. If the woman has severe ICP with peak bile acid 100 micromol/L or more, further routine testing of bile acids might not impact on decision making and therefore may not be routinely requiredManagementAdvise women that there are no treatments that improve pregnancy outcome (or raised bile acid concentrations) and treatments to improve maternal itching are of limited benefit.Timing of birthPatient type Birth timingMild ICPNo other risk factors Consider options of planned birth by 40 weeksModerate ICPNo other risk factors Consider planned birth at 38–39 weeks' gestationSevere ICP Consider planned birth at 35–36 weeks' gestationWomen with one or more of the following additional risk factors warrant consultant review to plan timing of birth:Gestational diabetes Pre-eclampsia Multifetal pregnancyWomen with severe ICP should be offered continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) during delivery"

Intheory, facilitated diffusion can be saturated.• In practice, the glucose transfer capacity (especially of the microvillous plasma membrane) is so large that it wouldnot approach saturation under in-vivo conditions• Fetal amino acid concentrations are generally higher than maternal levels• Transfer of amino acids from the mother to the fetus is therefore against a concentration gradient and energy (ATP) isrequired for this process• This energy is provided by coupling the transfer of amino acids (up a concentration gradient) to the transfer of sodiumions (down a concentration gradient) - secondary active transport. These are called Na+-dependent transporters. Thesodium concentration gradient is maintained by Na+K+ATPase.• Other amino acid transport systems are, however, Na+-independent."

female genital system,2405,A 27 year old women presents with a history of vaginal spotting and cramping abdominal pain. She has an 8 week history of amenorrhoea. On examination urine pregnancy test is positive and the cervix is open and blood is noted around the os. What is the likely diagnosis?,Antepartum haemorrhage,Threatened Miscarriage,Complete Miscarriage,Missed Miscarriage,Inevitable Miscarriage,E,The cervix is open and there is ongoing bleeding this is therefore Inevitable miscarriage Miscarriage Miscarriage is defined as the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks gestation. Ectopic pregnancy and gestational trophoblastic disease are not included. First trimester miscarriage is the spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 13 weeks' gestation and accounts for 85% of miscarriagesBleeding after 24 weeks is termed 'antepartum haemorrhage'. Classification of Miscarriage:Complete miscarriage is when all the products of conception have been expelled from the uterus and bleeding has stopped Threatened miscarriage is when uterine bleeding occurs but the viability of the pregnancy is unknown. The diagnosis is often an interim one Inevitable Miscarriage is when cramping pelvic pain and bleeding is associated with a dilated cervix Missed (or delayed) miscarriage occurs when pregnancy has failed (i.e. there is a non-viable fetus within the uterus) but products of conception have not been expelled* Recurrent miscarriage is the spontaneous consecutive loss of three pregnancies before 24 weeks' gestation*Some definitions state a missed miscarriage is where pregnancy failure has occurred in the absence of bleeding whereas some consider it in the absence of passing products of conception. The result is you may be asked questions where the patient has or has not had vaginal bleeding. If you know the fetus is non-viable from the USS then missed miscarriage is likely to be the correct answer.

It has been conclusively shown that blood levels of this anticonvulsant fall in all three trimesters. Most women taking lamotrigine in pregnancy will require their dose to be increased to keep them seizure free. The importance of monitoring and adjusting lamotrigine dose in pregnancy was highlighted in the 2006–08 Confidential Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (CMACE) guidelines. If the woman's dose of anticonvulsant is increased during pregnancy it should be reduced postpartum to avoid toxicity. Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is known to be more common in patients who do not take their prescribed anticonvulsants, and pregnant and breastfeeding women are often reluctant to take anticonvulsants for fear of harming their baby."

What percentage of recurrent first trimester miscarriage is attributable to APS?,40%,25%,15%,5%,1-2%,C,"Antiphospholipid Syndrome DefinitionAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder characterised by arterial and venous thrombosis, adverse pregnancy outcomes (for mother and fetus), and raised levels of antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodiesDiagnosisAPS diagnosed when 1 of the clinical criteria and 1 laboratory criteria are met.Lab criteria:Lupus anticoagulant (LA) present on 2 occasions (at least 12 weeks apart) Anticardiolipin (aCL) antibody is present (>40 GPL units or MPL units or >99th centile), on 2 occasions (at least 12 weeks apart) Anti-b2-glycoprotein I antibody in serum or plasma (in titre >99th centile) is present, on 2 occasions (at least 12 weeks apart)Clinical criteriaThrombosis: at least one episode of arterial or venous thrombosis. Pregnancy morbidity: at least one unexplained death of a normal-appearance fetus at or beyond the 10th week of gestation at least one preterm birth of a neonate of normal appearance before 34 weeks of gestation, because of eclampsia or severe pre-eclampsia or with signs of placental insufficiency three or more unexplained consecutive spontaneous miscarriages before 10 weeks of gestation where anatomical, hormonal and chromosomal causes have been excluded.EpidemiologyaPL antibodies present in around 2-3% of healthy individuals APS typically affects 20-50 year olds Male:female rato 1: 3.5-5 Prevalence in UK unknown APS accounts for 20% of recurrent thrombosis in people"
female genital system,2409,Risk of congenital heart block if mother has SLE with both anti-ro/la?,2%,5%,8%,12%,35%,A,"Recurrence in subsequent pregnancy is 16%Congenital heart blockThis is associated with maternal anti-Ro/La autoantibodies.Antibodies cross the placenta and destroy the Purkinje system. The usual presentation is a fixed fetal bradycardia of 60—-80 beats per minute on ultrasound scan. It occurs in 2-3% of fetuses of women with the anti-Ro/La antibody and there is a recurrence rate of 16% in subsequent pregnancics.It is associated with significant perinatal morbidity and mortality, with about half of infants requiring pacing by the first year of life. Congenital heart block develops between 18—28 weeks of gestation and fetal echocardiography should be performed around this period to detect it. Hydrops fetalis can occur in utero and is thought to be due to the degree of endomyocardial fibrosis and associated myocarditic,"
female genital system,2410,"A 38 year old woman underwent a suction evacuation procedure following a diagnosis of a missed miscarriage 8 weeks ago. Histopathology results confirmed a molar pregnancy. She had a blood sample taken to assess serum HCG 2 days ago at her GP surgery, which was 500 iu/ml. She presents to you for her follow up appointment. What is the most appropriate duration of follow up?",Follow up for 3 months from normalisation of hCG,Follow up for 6 months from diagnosis of molar pregnancy,Follow up for 3 months from date of uterine evacuation,Follow up for 6 months from normalisation of hCG,Follow up for 6 months from date of uterine evacuation,D,"As per the RCOG Green top Guideline on gestational trophoblastic disease: Follow up after GTD is highly individualised –Follow up is for 6 months after evacuation if hCG has reverted to normal within 56 days post-evacuation Follow up is for 6 months after normalisation if this happens after 56 days Women should be advised to delay conception until after their follow up is complete, even though the risk of molar pregnancy is low If women conceive within 12 months of receiving chemotherapy, there is a higher risk of miscarriage and higher risk of termination in women who receive multiagent chemotherapy. The rate of congenital anomaly is about 1.8% and there is an elevated stillbirth rate Barrier methods are advised until hCG reverts back to normal. Oral combined contraceptives can be used once hCG is normal, if used earlier they can make hCG follow ups difficult and the values may be higher if using oral combined contraceptive. Intrauterine contraceptive devices should not be used untill hCG reverts back to normal as there is increased risk of perforation"
female genital system,2411,A 65 year old woman attends vulval clinic due to vulval irritation with intermittent bleeding. You note an area where the epithelium has changed colour and you are concerned about the possibility of vulval cancer. Which of the following is the most appropriate action?,Testing for high risk HPV,Wide local excision with margin of 1 cm,Biopsy without removing whole lesion,Exfoliative cytology using Dacron swabs,Exfoliative cytology using scalpel scrapings,C,"Vulval cytology is not a substitute for diagnostic biopsy of lesions suspicious of vulval cancer Diagnostic biopsy should be taken to confirm the diagnosis prior to embarking on treatment such as wide local excision. Diagnostic biopsy should use representative incisional biopsies that avoid removal of the whole lesion.Vulval cytology is not a substitute for diagnostic biopsy of suspicious lesions. Testing for HPV is an appropriate screening tool for cervical cancer but not is not validated for screening for vulval cancer. In addition this patient is symptomatic so screening isn't really appropriate here.

female genital system,2415,"A woman with Ehlers Danlos syndrome hypermobility type (type III) has easily dislocatable hips and knees, hypermobile fingers, bruises easily and has been treated for inguinal and umbilical hernias as a teenager. Previously, she had a miscarriage at 8 weeks of gestation and is now at the antenatal clinic where a scan confirms a viable singleton fetus of 12 weeks of gestation. Which of the following investigations and/or assessments are necessary to prevent serious complications in her pregnancy and labour?",Physiotherapy assessment,Serial growth scans,Anaesthetic assessment,"Platelet function tests, capillary fragility and/or coagulation screen",Cervical length scans,D,"All the investigations are relevant in her care during pregnancy.The most likely problems that will occur during her pregnancy will be backache and pelvic girdle pain due to ligamentous laxity. Connective tissue weakness also could cause the cervix to be incompetent, which could lead to 'late' miscarriage, preterm delivery or precipitate delivery and, hence, screening for cervical length.However, during labour, the uterus may be atonic after delivery, bringing risks of postpartum haemorrhage, which may be life threatening.Therefore, the risk of easy bruising should be explored by platelet function tests, capillary fragility and/or coagulation screen in order to plan delivery and care accordingly to previous serious complications in labour."
female genital system,2416,A 23-year-old woman whose mother died at the age of 56 of cervical cancer comes to see you. She wants to know how to reduce her own risk of cervical cancer. What is the single most important piece of advice you could give her?,To avoid sexual promiscuity,To undergo prophylactic risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy,To stop smoking,To attend regularly for cervical screening,Annual screening,D,The incidence of cervical carcinoma has drastically reduced in countries with screening programmes. Only 1% of abnormal smears progress to malignancy over a long period of time. Most women with cervical cancer have not had a smear in the last 5 years and many of then have never had a smear.

preventive medicine,1,Which of the following are required for the diagnosis of brain stem death?,At least two sets of tests must be performed 24 hours apart,'Doll's eye' movements must be absent,Spinal reflexes must be absent,The core temperature must not be less than 37°C,The pupils must be fixed and dilated,B,"Brain stem death (BSD) is confirmed by demonstrating the absence of brain stem reflexes, and is characterised by profound coma. An independent existence is impossible after BSD. Before the tests can be performed, several preconditions must be met unequivocally:  the presence of apnoeic coma a defined cause of severe and irreversible brain damage and the exclusion of potentially reversible conditions which can mimic BSD (hypothermia can mimic BSD, so the core temperature must be above 35°C).  The tests must be performed by two doctors and then repeated following an interval determined by the clinical condition of the patient (not 24 hours apart). The confirmatory tests include:  fixed unresponsive pupils with absence of both the direct and consensual light reflexes (the pupils do not have to be dilated and pupil size is not a factor) absent corneal reflexes absent oculocephalic reflexes, with no doll's eye movements (i.e. the eyes do not move on rotating the head from side to side) absent vestibulo-ocular reflexes absent motor activity after painful stimulation absent gag reflex absence of spontaneous respiration.  Spinal reflexes are often retained in BSD, and this is due to intact neural arcs acting independently of central control. Therefore, the absence of spinal reflexes is not required to diagnose BSD."

The results have a median of 3 days, are negatively skewed and the interquartile range is 2 to 6 days. Select the true statement",25% of patients stay between 2 and 6 days,The mean is less than 3,50% of patients stay between 2 and 6 days,99% of patients stay between 2 and 6 days,95% of patients stay between 2 and 6 days,C,The interquartile range runs from 25% to 75%
preventive medicine,3,"In a double blind, randomised, placebo controlled trial of a new diuretic looking at reduction in serum potassium, 100 patients received the new diuretic and 100 patients received placebo. In the treatment group, serum potassium decreased from a mean of 6.5 to 5.5 mmol/L. In the control group, serum potassium decreased from a mean of 6.8 to 6.1 mmol/L. The authors concluded that the new diuretic was effective in reducing potassium as p=0.01 (2-tailed test). Which of the following statements is correct?",The alternative hypothesis is that drug A is equally effective or equally ineffective compared to placebo,The alternative hypothesis is that drug A is more effective or less effective than placebo,The alternative hypothesis is that drug A is more effective than placebo,The alternative hypothesis is that placebo is more effective than drug A,There is no alternative hypothesis in this trial,B,"The alternative hypothesis in a two-tailed statistical hypothesis testing is always that there is a difference between the variables we would like to test for a difference. Therefore, in this case the alternative hypothesis should be that there is a difference between the new diuretic and placebo in their potassium reducing effect, that is, the new diuretic is either more effective or less effective than placebo."
preventive medicine,4,A study of subjects with learning difficulties was performed. The 112 subjects put through programme A showed an increase in their mean IQ score of 6 points. The 115 subjects put through programme B showed an increase in their mean IQ score of 4. The p value was >0.05. Which of the following is true?,The distribution of individual values is not important,The above results would be found by chance in less than 1:20,Even though the difference between the means is not significant it would be appropriate to calculate confidence intervals,The study demonstrates the usefulness of programme A,The numbers are too large for a Student's t test,C,Even though the difference between the means is not significant it would be appropriate to calculate confidence intervals. This gives us an idea of the distribution of the data. Confidence intervals may provide more meaningful data concerning the study.The chances are greater than 1 in 20 as P is greater than 0.05.The t test could be used in the comparison of data and the larger the sample size the more meaningful the data.A is no more useful than B or even simply repeating an IQ test.
preventive medicine,5,"In a study of correlation between serum insulin level (microunit/ml) and waist circumference (cm), 100 patients were recruited. It was found that the correlation coefficient between serum insulin level and waist circumference is 0.5. Which of the following statements is correct?",A 95% confidence interval should be constructed for the correlation coefficient,A change in the unit of measurement in insulin level will change the correlation coefficient,"For every cm increase in waist circumference, the insulin level increases by an average of 0.3 microunit/ml",The correlation between serum insulin level and waist circumference is weak,There is no linear correlation between insulin level and waist circumference,A,"A 95% confidence interval should be constructed for the correlation coefficient. The confidence interval can help readers know what the probable range of correlation coefficient is. Correlation coefficient does not change with unit of measurements. It cannot be said that for every cm increase in waist circumference, the insulin level increases by an average of 0.3 microunit/ml since this is the interpretation of regression coefficient (not given in the question), not correlation coefficient. It is difficult to judge whether the correlation is weak or not. A correlation coefficient of 0.5 is not bad. There could also be other non-linear correlation between the variables. It is difficult to judge whether there is linear correlation between insulin level and waist circumference based on the correlation coefficient alone. A scatter plot will be more helpful."
preventive medicine,6,A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled study of a cholesterol-lowering drug in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease was conducted over a five year follow up period. The absolute risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in the group receiving placebo during this time was 10%. The relative risk of those given the cholesterol lowering medication was 0.8. What number of patients will need to be treated with active drug for five years to prevent one myocardial infarction?,20,40,50,80,100,C,The absolute risk of MI in the treatment group is 10% × 0.8 = 8% (as they have a relative risk of 0.8 compared to the placebo group). Number needed to treat (NNT) = 1 / absolute risk reduction (ARR). ARR is the risk in control group - risk in treated group. Therefore the ARR is 10% − 8% and the NNT for that period is 1 / 0.02 = 50.
preventive medicine,7,Study X involves a trial of 40 patients. It finds no difference between the control (treated with placebo) group and treatment groups (being treated with Drug A). The null hypothesis ( that Drug A makes no difference to outcomes) is accepted. Several larger studies involving several thousand patients clearly demonstrate Drug A makes a statically significant difference to outcomes. What type of error has occurred in Study X?,Type 1 error,Type 2 error,Study bias,P-value error,Selection bias,B,This is an example of a Type 2 error.

preventive medicine,9,Which of the following is true of meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials?,Gives conclusion making further controlled trials unnecessary,Is usually performed if individual trials are considered to have used flawed methods,Provides a more stable estimate of the effect of treatment than individual trials,Should include trials in which patient selection is not randomised,Should only include peer-reviewed studies,C,"Meta-analyses combine the results from individual studies to produce an estimate of the overall effect of interest. The individual studies do not have to be peer reviewed. By looking at the effects of numerous small trials, the direction and magnitude of the average effect with an associated confidence interval, allows treatment effects with greater power and precision to be detected. This would lead to quality differences as the study designs should be similar. This is the main reason for doing a meta-analysis. It gives conclusions with both high power and precision to estimate effects but also leads to questions that further controlled trials need to address."
preventive medicine,10,A random selection of 1200 adults agree to participate in a study of the possible effects of drug X. They are followed prospectively for a period of five years to see if there is an association between the incidence of cataract and the use of drug X. Which type of study is this?,Cohort study,Cross‐over study,Case‐control study,Cross‐sectional study,Randomised controlled clinical trial,A,"Cohort studies or longitudinal studies involve the follow up of individuals.A cohort study may be prospective in which individuals who are exposed and non‐exposed to a putative risk factor are followed up over a defined period of time and the disease experience of the exposed group at the end of follow up is compared with that of the non‐exposed group.A cohort study may also be historical (retrospective or non‐concurrent). A cohort is identified, for whom records of exposure status are available from the past, and whose disease experience can now be measured, a substantial period of time having already elapsed since exposure."
preventive medicine,11,"In clinical trials, which of the following is true?",Errors are more common when big samples are used,Type I error is more likely to occur when multiple t tests are used,Type I error is wrongly accepting the null hypothesis,Type II error is accepting the null hypothesis when it is valid,Type II error is increased by the use of a confidence interval,B,"We reject the null hypothesis if our P-value is less than the significance level, that is, that is, pless than ∝ (the probability of making a type I error is denoted by ∝). Therefore, we conclude that there is no effect when one really exists. The chance of a type II error is denoted by β. Power increases with increasing sample size. This means that a large sample has a greater ability to detect a clinically important effect if it exists. The type I error rate increases as the number of comparisons increases, leading to spurious conclusions. However, it is possible to use some form of post-hoc adjustment to the P-value to take account of the number of tests performed (Bonferroni approach). Confidence intervals allow a true estimate of the breadth of a difference reducing the likelihood of a type II error."
preventive medicine,12,"In a study of the relationship between blood cholesterol level and waist circumference, 100 diabetic patients were studied and linear regression analysis produced the following regression equation: Y = BX − C Where:  Y = cholesterol level (mmol/L) X = waist circumference (cm) Estimate of B = 0.2 (95% confidence interval 0.17-0.23, p = 0.01)  Which of the following statements is true?",B is the correlation coefficient between Y and X,"For every mmol/L increase in cholesterol, the waist circumference increases by an average of 5 cm",The constant C can be estimated from this study,The equation accurately describes the relationship between Y and X since p is below 0.05,The numerical value of B is independent of the units of X and Y,C,"When using linear regression, both B and C can be estimated based on the study data. B is the regression coefficient, not correlation coefficient. For every cm increase in waist circumference, the blood cholesterol increases by an average of 0.2 mmol/L. The reverse is generally not true as this will require estimation of another regression coefficient, which is usually not the inverse of B numerically. A significant p value indicates a significant linear relationship between Y and X. But the equation may not accurately describe the relationship since there may be other higher order relationships present. The numerical value of B depends on the units of both Y and X."

preventive medicine,14,"In a randomised controlled trial comparing drug A and placebo for treatment of diabetes mellitus, a sample size needs to be calculated. If the investigators assume that the mean HbA1c level of participants is 8%, in order to detect a difference of 1% HbA1c level after treatment between the two groups, with a power of 90% at significance level of 0.05 by two-sided test, the sample size needed for each group is calculated to be N. If the standard deviation of HbA1c is larger than expected, which of the following statements is correct?",The chance of type I error will increase if the same sample size is used,The chance of type II error will increase if the same sample size is used,The difference in HbA1c between the 2 groups will be larger,The difference that can be detected will be increased if the same sample size is used,The statistical power will not be affected even if the same sample size is used,B,"As the power decreases, type II error (= 1-power) will increase. Therefore, the chance of type II error will increase if the same sample size is used. The chance of type I error will remain the same as the set level of significance. The difference does not depend on standard deviation. The difference that can be detected will decrease. The statistical power will decrease if the standard deviation increases."

preventive medicine,16,"A research project aims to find the average age at which women are diagnosed with endometriosis. Women who are diagnosed based on laparoscopy findings have their age on the day of the procedure noted and sent to the researcher. The average age is found to be 34.2 years, and the 95% confidence interval is 29.2 ‐ 39.2 years. If the sample size increased, which one of the following would happen to the confidence interval?",Confidence interval would become narrower,No change to the confidence interval,Level of confidence would increase to 99%,Level of confidence would decrease to 90%,Confidence interval would become wider,A,"The confidence interval is a measure of ascertaining what the true population means would be based on the findings of a sample.In this instance, the results say that we are 95% confident that although the sample mean is 34.2 years, the population mean could be anywhere between 29.2 and 39.2 years.The formula for 95% confidence interval is as follows:CI = sample mean +/‐ (standard error x 1.96)Increasing the sample size makes the standard error smaller, making the confidence interval more narrow, meaning that we would now be 95% confident that the population mean would be in a narrow set of ages.The level of confidence is set prior to starting the study.It is not dependant on the sample size.Increasing the confidence level to 99% means the interval becomes much wider, in order to be so confident, whilst maintaining accuracy.Decreasing to 90% means that the interval becomes narrower, but also means that in 1 out of 10 times, the true population means would be outside the interval found."

The following table lists the results:      Antibody +ve Antibody -ve Total   Hashimoto's disease confirmed at FNA 35 15 50   No evidence of disease at FNA 30 920 950    Approximately, what is the sensitivity of the antibody test for the detection of Hashimoto's disease?",50%,60%,70%,80%,90%,C,"The sensitivity of a test is the ability of a test to identify those with the condition. In this example, 50 individuals had Hashimoto's disease according to the gold standard test of biopsy, with 35 of these being identified by the antibody test. Sensitivity is calculated as true positive / (true positive + false negative). Thus: Sensitivity = 35/(35+15) = 70%. Another way to look at this is as follows:  Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test. 50 patients (35+15) have Hashimotos diagnosed on Gold Standard testing. 35 of these have a positive antibody test and hence correctly identify a positive diagnosis 15 of these are identified by the test as negative (but are actually positive when using gold standard FNA) and are thus a false negative.

Which one of the following most accurately reflects the information generated from such a study?",Adverse events profile,Comparative therapeutic efficacy,Cost benefit analysis,Cost effectiveness,Drug potency,A,"Post-marketing surveillance (PMS)/observational studies (phase IV studies) generally are designed to assess the potential side effects of new drugs but under everyday conditions and with a minimum of intervention. In contrast to the randomised controlled trials, PMS typically includes patients from more extreme age groups and patients with comorbidity or other risk factors. In order to cover a wide spectrum of patients and to observe rare events with sufficiently high probability, PMS enrols a large number of patients, typically several thousands. Comparative efficacy has already been undertaken in phase III studies (RCTs) but can also be undertaken as part of specific RCT studies later in the drugs development and potency usually in phase I and II studies."
preventive medicine,23,"In a randomised controlled trial comparing drug A and drug B for treatment of head lice infestation, a sample size needs to be calculated. The investigators assume that 30% of patients will fail treatment with drug B, in order to detect a 10% reduction in failure rate with drug A, with a power of 90% at significance level of 0.05 by two-sided Chi-squared test. They do not plan to have equal sample sizes for each group.  Which of the following statements is correct?","If 15% reduction in failure rate needs to be detected, a larger sample size is required","If 40% of patients will fail treatment with drug B, a smaller sample size is sufficient","If more patients are allocated to drug A than drug B, a larger total sample size is required",Information given is insufficient to calculate sample size,McNemar test should be used,C,"Equal randomisation is statistically the most efficient method of determine a significant difference between groups. The most power to detect a difference occurs with equal group sizes. However, there are a number of reasons (e.g. ethics, cost etc.) which mean it is not possible. If the groups differ in size you would expect a muted treatment response, and you therefore need larger sample sizes to observe a treatment effect. There is enough information given in the question to determine required sample size, but you are not expected to know the details of this for the purpose of the MRCP. Sample size is not determined by failure rate. Chi-squared test should be used for two independent samples. McNemar's test is used to compare paired samples; either case control studies where each case is matched to a control, or to studies where two treatments are given to matched subjects. It cannot be used where the sample size differs."

If the values are normally distributed, which of the following is correct?",Approximately 95% of the values lie within 33 kg and 47 kg,Exactly 90% of the values lie within 26 kg and 54 kg,The standard deviation of a normally distributed sample is usually positive,The standard error of the sample is 7/10,The standard error of the sample is 7/100,D,"When analysing normally distributed data the standard deviation represents the spread of a population that is normally distributed. It is always positive, the larger the value, the greater the spread. If values are normally distributed, approximately 95% of values lie within +/- 2 standard deviations of the mean. Exactly 95% of values lie within 1.96 standard deviations of the mean. The standard error (of the mean) represents how well the sample mean approximates the population mean. The larger the sample, the smaller the standard error, and the closer the sample mean approximates the population mean. The standard error can be used to conduct confidence intervals. The interval (estimate +/- 1.96 standard errors) is a 95% confidence interval for the population value. Standard error = standard deviation/√sample size. The values of 33 kg and 47 kg are 1 standard deviation of the mean. Approximately 95% of values lie within +/- 2 standard deviations of the mean. The values of 26 kg and 54 kg are 2 standard deviations either side of the mean. Approximately 95% of values lie within +/- 2 standard deviations of the mean. The standard deviation is a measure of spread of a normal distribution. It is always positive. The standard error of the sample is standard deviation/√n, i.e. 7/√100 = 7/10 It should be 7/√100 not 7/100."

preventive medicine,28,Which of the following is true of a 95% confidence interval (CI)?,Can only be used in parametric data,Is a test of the null hypothesis,Is calculated at ±1.96 times the standard error of the mean,Is not useful when comparing data with another population,"If zero difference lies within the 95% when comparing two groups to a treatment, it indicates the treatment is not effective",C,"Ninety five per cent confidence intervals can be used for both distributional and distribution-free data. A 95% confidence interval looks at the range of values within which we are 95% confident that the true population parameter lies. Therefore, using the above definition, if we were to repeat the experiment many times, the interval would contain the true population mean on 95% of occasions. Confidence intervals increase the accuracy when comparing means with another population by looking at the spread of differences. A wide confidence interval indicates that the estimate is imprecise and if the 95% CI crosses zero it may indicate that the treatment has no effect; it may be that the study is underpowered and not able to detect a difference (the difference may still exist)."

A correlation coefficient of 0 means that there is no linear relationship between the variables. The correlation coefficient does not depend on sample size. Increasing the sample size will not change the correlation coefficient as its value does not depends on sample size. Increasing the sample size will reduce the standard error of the mean and the width of the confidence interval. Increasing the sample size will not change the standard deviation of the waist circumference but will reduce the standard error of the mean. The correlation is not necessarily linear, although the Pearson correlation coefficient is estimated under the assumption that the correlation is linear."
preventive medicine,32,"In an international randomised controlled trial comparing regimen A (group A) and regimen B (group B) for the treatment of medullary thyroid cancer, 100 patients were allocated to group A and 100 patients were allocated to group B. It was found that the median survival duration in group A was six months and the median survival duration in group B was nine months. Which of the following statements is correct?",6-month overall survival was lower in group A compared with group B,Both regimen A and B are ineffective as the median survival durations are both too short,Mean survival duration should be presented instead of median survival duration,Regimen B is more effective than regimen A,The majority of patients died before six months in group B,A,"6-month overall survival was lower in group A compared with group B. 6-month overall survival is 50% for group A and greater than50% for group B. Although the survivals are short, an improvement of several months may be very important to patients with such a deadly disease. Mean survival is misleading, especially if many patients are lost to follow up. In addition survival is very likely to be skewed and mean may not be representative. Median should be used for survival data. Although median survival duration appears better in regimen B, it remains unclear whether the difference is statistically significant. 50% of patients died by nine months. This means that the majority survived before that."
preventive medicine,33,You are doing an audit at work and want to investigate the effectiveness of new morning teaching sessions for the junior doctors. You wish to compare the mean scores of 100 doctors in a prescribing test before and after teaching. Which would be the most appropriate statistical test to use?,Chi square test,Cox proportional hazards model,Kaplan-Meier,Paired t test,Unpaired t test,D,"A paired t  test is used to compare two population means where you have two samples in which observations in one sample can be paired with observations in the other sample. Examples are before-and-after observations on the same subjects (as in this case before and after teaching) and comparisons of two different methods of measurement. Before carrying out a t  test the data should be checked to ensure that they are approximately normally distributed. A chi square test is used to test the null hypothesis about a relationship between two variables, rather than two means as in this case. Cox proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier are both survival models which are used to estimate the survival function from lifetime data and are often used to measure the fraction of patients living for a certain amount of time after treatment. Survival models would be inappropriate to compare the means in this case. An unpaired t  test should be used to test the null hypothesis that two population means are equal. As the same population is being compared here, a paired test should be used instead."

preventive medicine,37,"In a study of the utility of serum procalcitonin level for early diagnosis of bacteraemia, 100 consecutive febrile patients admitted to hospital were tested for serum procalcitonin and culture of bacteria. It was reported that serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 microgram/L had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 80% and negative predictive value of 95%. Bacteraemia is thought to be more likely with increasing levels of serum procalcitonin.  Which of the following statements is correct?",The negative predictive value will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The positive predictive value will decrease if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The reliability of the sensitivity and specificity will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The sensitivity will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The specificity will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,E,"If disease is more likely with increasing levels of a diagnostic marker (in this case increasing procalcitonin levels), then the specificity will increase with increasing diagnostic threshold and sensitivity will decrease. The positive and negative predictive values are more difficult to predict with changes in diagnostic threshold. But usually the positive predictive value will increase and negative predictive value will decrease with increasing threshold. The reliability of sensitivity and specificity depends on the sample size and reproducibility of the test result and does not depend on the diagnostic cut-off."

preventive medicine,39,Which of the following statements is correct regarding standard error of the mean (SEM) and standard deviation (SD)?,Standard error of mean increases with sample size,Student's t test is a non‐parametric test,Standard deviation may be greater than the mean even if all values are positive numbers,Standard deviation invariably falls with increasing sample size,Standard error of mean is calculated by taking the square root of the standard deviation of the sample means,C,"The standard error of the mean = SD/√n.SD does not necessarily fall with sample size, as the distribution of values may increase and hence SD increase. SEM would decrease with sample size as can be seen in the above calculation.The SD is greater than the mean if the sample values are negative. Even if none of the values are negative, the standard deviation may be greater than the mean. For example: 4 numbers: 0, 0, 2, 3. The mean is 1.25, the population standard deviation is 1.3 and the sample standard deviation is 1.5.This is not the same as 'negatively skewed' where the distribution of data about the mean tails off to the left with the majority of points being greater (the median and the mode are greater than the mean).This question is a trick ‐ and quite a trivial one at that. A negative distribution's mean would be, of course, negative but the standard deviation would still be a positive number.Student's t test is a parametric test comparing normally distributed data."
preventive medicine,40,"A randomised double-blind placebo controlled study of a cholesterol-lowering drug for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease was conducted. It had a five-year follow up period. The results showed an absolute risk of myocardial infarction (MI), in the group receiving placebo, was 10 per cent. The relative risk reduction of those given the cholesterol lowering medication was 0.8. Approximately what number of patients will need to be treated with the drug for five years to prevent one myocardial infarction?",10,13,15,20,25,B,"This is a question concerning number needed to treat (NNT). The calculation involves a little arithmetic. The absolute risk of MI in the group is a pretty high 10%, that is, of 1000 patients on placebo 100 will have MI over five years. The relative risk reduction is stated as 0.8, that is, 80%. Therefore, if you treat 1000 patients for five years with the cholesterol lowering agent you will get only 20 MIs. Thus, for 1000 patients treated you will get 80 fewer MIs. Thus number needed to treat to get one fewer MI is 1000/80 = 12.5. However, the andquot;number needed to treatandquot; has to be a whole number, so is always rounded up to the nearest whole number, giving our answer of 13. Or, if you are any good at remembering formulae you can remember the following:  Relative risk reduction (RRR) = Absolute risk reduction (ARR) / Control event rate (CER) Numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 1 / Absolute risk reduction (ARR)  You can then just insert the figures into these formulae. The control (or placebo) event rate (CER) is 10% or 0.10. The relative risk reduction is 0.80. Inserting these figures into the above formulae:    RRR = ARR / CER   0.80 = ARR / 0.10   ARR = 0.80 × 0.10   ARR = 0.08    Then the NNT can be calculated by NNT = 1 / ARR = 1 / 0.08 = 12.5. Which, rounded up to the nearest whole number, is 13. However, if algebra is not your thing you could try working with real numbers. Imagine a group of 100 patients (it makes the maths easier). In the control (or placebo group) 10% (or 10 patients) suffered an MI. The relative risk reduction is 0.8 or 80%. Therefore, in the treatment group, there would be a reduction in events by 80% (of 10 patients) = 8 patients. The number of patients suffering an MI in the treatment would therefore be 10 − 8 = 2 patients. It can therefore be said that treating 100 patients with the new drug would result in eight fewer MIs. The number needed to treat to prevent one MI would be 100/8 = 12.5 patients. "
preventive medicine,41,Which of the following is correct in comparing confidence intervals with P values?,95% confidence intervals are equivalent to a P value of 0.95,"As the sample size decreases, the confidence interval will decrease",Confidence intervals refer to the target population,The confidence interval is approximately equal to the standard deviation,The P value measures how clinically significant a statistical result is,C,"Estimation procedures can be of two types:  Point estimates Interval estimates  The sample mean (x) is a logical point estimate of the population with a mean of μ. The confidence interval gives a measure of the true mean μ lying between two values. The 95% confidence interval is defined as: mean +/− 1.96 × the standard error of the mean. The standard error of the mean equals the population variance σ/√N. The standard error of the mean therefore decreases as the population sample increases. The confidence intervals therefore decrease as the population sample increases. Unfortunately, statistical significance does not equate with clinical significance. For example, a doubling of risk from 0.0001% to 0.0002% may be completely insignificant, even though it is statistically highly significant."
preventive medicine,42,"In a randomised controlled trial comparing drug A and placebo for treatment of diabetes mellitus, a sample size needs to be calculated.

preventive medicine,43,"In a study of the utility of serum procalcitonin level for early diagnosis of bacteraemia, 100 consecutive febrile patients admitted to hospital were tested for serum procalcitonin and culture of bacteria. It was reported that serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 microgram/L had a specificity of 90% in detecting bacteraemia. Which of the following statements is correct?",10% of the patients who do not have bacteraemia would be expected to have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 µg/L,10% of the patients who have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 µg/L would be expected not to have bacteraemia,90% of the patients who have bacteraemia would be expected to have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 µg/L,90% of the patients who have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 µg/L would be expected to have bacteraemia,Specificity will be higher if 200 patients instead of 100 patients were tested,A,Specificity defines the ability of the test to correctly exclude a disease - in this case the proportion of healthy patients known not to have the disease who will test negative for it. It is calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the sum of the true negatives and false positives. A specificity of 90% means that 90% of individuals without the disease (bacteraemia) will test negative (serum procalcitonin less than 0.5 µg/L). Therefore 10% without bacteraemia would be expected to have serum procalcitonin levels of more than 0.5 µg/L. All the other options are wrong. The number of patients will not affect specificity.

preventive medicine,48,You are told that a study has a R value of -0.11 and a p value of 0.09. Select the true statement from the following,R stands for covariance,A positive R value means that there is no association,The p value suggests that the result is not significant,A negative R value signifies a positive association,A positive r value signifies a negative association,C,A p value is only considered significant when it is less than 0.05. The R value refers to the association of variables. A positive R value means that the increase of one value leads to the increase of another. A negative R value means that as one variable increases its associated variable decreases.
preventive medicine,49,"In a randomised controlled trial of drug A for treatment of hypercholesterolemia, 100 patients received drug A and 100 patients received placebo. In the treatment group, serum cholesterol decreased from a mean of 6.5 to 5.5 mmol/L. In the control group, cholesterol decreased from a mean of 6.8 to 6.1 mmol/L. The authors concluded that drug A was effective in reducing cholesterol as p=0.01. Which of the following statement is correct?",A non-parametric test is inappropriate in testing the difference of cholesterol between the two groups,A paired t test may have been used,An independent sample t test may have been used,Drug A should be used to treat hypercholesterolemia,The result is biased as the two groups had different cholesterol level at baseline,C,"An independent sample t-test may have been used. Since the two treatment groups are independent and the sample sizes are relatively large (greater than30 in each group) and cholesterol level is approximately Normally distributed, an independent sample t-t; test is appropriate. Non-parametric test can also be used although a parametric test is generally preferred for its efficiency unless the assumptions of a parametric test are not met. A paired t-test is used to compare post-treatment and pre-treatment result of a single group. Although drug A appears more effective in reducing cholesterol, whether we should use it depends on other factors, such as drug safety and cost. It is difficult to judge whether baseline values of 6.5 and 6.8 mmol/L were significantly different without a formal statistical test. However, since the trial is randomised, i.e. the patients are randomly allocated to the two treatment groups, they should be considered comparable at baseline unless there is evidence to the contrary."

You are seeking to investigate this. Which of the following is the optimal way to investigate this?",Appropriate animal study,Case-control study,New randomised controlled trial,Re-analysis of phase III clinical trials,Yellow card reports,B,"A nested case-control study is likely to deliver results rapidly with respect to establishing risk factors for developing the rash. Cases of rash can be compared against a much larger number of those who have not developed rash, and differences in medical history, or findings on clinical examination, identified. These may then lead to labelling advice around risk of rash if specific differences are identified. Unfortunately the yellow card reporting system is thought to capture only around 5% of adverse events, and so is not the best option in this regard. Given the event is rare, a re-analysis of phase III clinical trials and a new RCT are also highly unlikely to have sufficient power to evaluate any association between skin rash and the vaccine. Skin reactions in animal studies are difficult to extrapolate to human studies and vice versa, as such an animal study would also not be useful."

Which one of the following techniques is most appropriate?,Case-control study,Dose ranging study,"Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study",Meta-analysis,Sequential trial,D,"The drug is an established one and the correct answer can be found by elimination. A 'double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled study' would be time consuming, expensive and unlikely to be powered enough to detect what may be a rare toxic effect. Remember the drug is established so there have been many patients taking it already and only lately a letter is published in a medical journal. A 'dose ranging study' is really for another purpose, i.e. to decide the correct dose in early clinical trials, so it is hardly going to be of any use here. A 'sequential' trial would be comparing one therapy to another sequentially (usually with wash out periods in between). Again there are unlikely to be enough subjects in the trial for this small risk. A case-control study would look at cases of photosensitivity (perhaps in subjects taking any antidepressant medication) and compare them to age-matched (or other criteria matched) control subjects to see if they were more, less, or equally likely to be on the antidepressant in question. It would produce a lower level of evidence than a meta-analysis, and would require getting more raw data (which is less rapid and efficient than meta-analysis). A 'meta-analysis' would look at combining all previous data, hoping there had been some trials that looked at photosensitivity for it to be of any use in this case.

A randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial recruits patients in hospital with an exacerbation of their ulcerative colitis. A standard questionnaire is used to record the frequency of exacerbations of disease over a two year period. Results show that there is no difference between the drug and placebo and the results are published in a medical journal. To which form of bias is this study most susceptible?,Observer bias,Assessment bias,Recall bias,Allocation bias,Selection bias,E,Bias occurs when there is a systematic difference between the results from a randomised controlled trial and the true state of affairs.In this case the study population (people in hospital with a flare of UC) is different from the population to whom the results will be applied (all people who have UC) and there is therefore said to be a selection bias.∙ Allocation bias occurs when patients are not randomly assigned to a particular treatment.∙ Assessment bias occurs when the observer knows which treatment the subject is taking. ∙ Observer bias is when one observer consistently under or over reports a particular variable.∙ Recall bias applies to case‐control studies when a patient is more likely to remember a particular detail of exposure if they go on to develop the disease.It has been argued that the early results of trials of HRT demonstrating potentially positive results on reduction in cardiovascular risk are related to selection bias as women of higher social classes who exercised more were likely to choose HRT.

In simple randomisation, every member of the population is numbered, and a random sample is selected.In a stratified random sample, groups of interest are identified, and then randomisation occurs within those groups.In systematic sampling a ""periodic"" approach is used. This is not really random and is open to alteration and bias.In a cluster sample, a natural grouping of population is used (such as a family), but this may well be unrepresentative of the whole population.Classic errors in randomisation are:∙ Consecutive sampling, which may well not be representative if the study time is short. ∙ Convenience sampling: strong potential for bias, with volunteers generally healthier than others. ∙ Judgmental sample: including those that you want only.

preventive medicine,136,A letter to a medical journal suggested that an established antidepressant may cause photosensitivity. The manufacturer wished to set up a study to determine rapidly and efficiently whether this was a true association. Which one of the following techniques is most appropriate?,Dose ranging study,"Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study",Sequential trial,Case‐control study,Meta‐analysis,E,"The drug is an established one and the correct answer can be found by elimination.A 'double‐blind, randomised, placebo controlled study' would be time consuming, expensive and unlikely to be powered enough to detect what may be a rare toxic effect. Remember the drug is established so there have been many patients taking it already and only lately a letter is published in a medical journal.A 'dose ranging study' is really for another purpose ‐ to decide the correct dose in early clinical trials so it is hardly going to be of any use here.A 'sequential' trial would be comparing one therapy to another sequentially (usually with wash out periods in between). Again there are unlikely to be enough subjects in the trial for this small risk.A case‐control study would look at cases of photosensitivity (perhaps in subjects taking any antidepressant medication) and compare them to age matched (or other criteria matched) control subjects to see if they were more, less or equally likely to be on the antidepressant in question. It would produce a lower level of evidence than a meta‐analysis, and would require getting more raw data (which is less rapid and efficient than meta‐analysis).A 'meta‐analysis' would look at combining all previous data, hoping there had been some trials that looked at photosensitivity for it to be of any use in this case. This is likely to be the quickest option to complete, and also produces the highest level of evidence."

preventive medicine,138,A publication assesses a new diagnostic test for thyroid cancer. Which of the following terms would reflect the number of cases of thyroid cancer correctly identified by this new test?,Accuracy,Negative predictive value,Positive predictive value,Sensitivity,Specificity,D,The specificity of a test is the probability that a test will produce a true negative result when used on an unaffected population. The sensitivity of a test is the probability that it will produce a true positive result when used on an affected population (as determined by a reference or andquot;gold standardandquot;). The positive predictive value of a test is the probability that a person is affected when a positive test result is observed. The negative predictive value of a test is the probability that a person is not affected when a negative test result is observed. Accuracy is expressed through the above four parameters.

preventive medicine,141,Which of the following is correct in statistics?,"A normally distributed population, 95 per cent of the values fall in the range of the mean plus or minus one standard deviation",Standard error and standard deviation (SD) are synonymous,The chi-squared test applies only to parametric data,The statement andquot;p is less than 0.01andquot; means that there is less than 1% likelihood of an event having occurred by chance,Variance is equal to the square-root of the standard deviation,D,Mean plus or minus 2 SDs encompasses 95% of normally distributed observations. The SD is the square root of the variance (Variance is therefore the square of the SD). SEM=root mean square SD. Chi-squared test assesses proportions and does not depend upon normality. Statistical significance is usually accepted at the p less than0.05 value. This means that in less than 5% of occasions could such an observation be seen. With a p value of 0.01 this means that the observation would be seen by chance in 1 in 100 occasions.
preventive medicine,142,Which of the following are not features of systematic review?,Critical appraisal is always criterion-based,Meta-analysis is always performed,Search for literature is comprehensive using explicit search strategy,The research question is always focused,There are at least two authors,B,"Critical appraisal is an important part of systematic review and it has to be objectively performed using well-defined criteria or appraisal tools. Meta-analysis, that is, combining results numerically in a statistically appropriate way, though desirable, is not always feasible, depending on the availability of usable data and heterogeneity. The search strategy in systematic review should be comprehensive involving electronic databases and other sources and using well-defined search terms. Systematic review attempts to answer a focused structured question such as whether intervention X is effective for condition Y. This is in contrast to a narrative review which is usually broader in scope and provides a wider background. In performing systematic review, there are at least two authors to independently appraise the search results and primary studies."

Therefore, the weight of each study should depend on the sample size. Meta-analysis can be performed on aggregate data, provided that sufficient information is available. It is not mandatory to exclude studies with missing data. The effect size should not affect the weight of each study, although it will affect the final result. Trial quality is usually not incorporated into meta-analysis nowadays since the weightings can be subjective and arbitrary."

The authors concluded that drug A was effective in reducing cholesterol as p=0.01 (2-tailed test). Which of the following statements is correct?",A one-tailed test should be used,Both type I and type II error rates cannot be determined because of inadequate information,The power of the study is 99%,Type I error rate is 0.01,Type II error rate is 0.01,D,"Type I error rate is the probability of wrongly rejecting the null hypothesis and type II error rate is the probability of wrongly accepting the null hypothesis. In this case the p value is below 0.05 and we accept the alternative hypothesis in favour of the null hypothesis, that is, we conclude that drug A is more effective than placebo. The p value of 0.01 represents that there is a probability of 0.01 of observing the results if the null hypothesis is true. Thus if we reject the null hypothesis, we may be wrong with a probability of 0.01, which is the type I error rate. Type II error rate is 0 as we have not accepted the null hypothesis.

Which of the following statement is correct?",Kaplain Meier survival curves can be used to compare the survival between the two groups,Logrank test can be used to compare the median survival between the two groups,Mann-Whitney U test can be used to compare the survival between the two groups,Mean survival should be used instead of median survival,Unpaired t test can be used to compare the survival between the two groups,A,"Kaplan Meier curves can be drawn to compare the survival of the two groups graphically. They display the cumulative probability (i.e. the survival probability) of an individual remaining free of the trial endpoint at any time after baseline. This changes when the endpoint occurs, so the curve is displayed as a series of steps. Data is censored if the patient had not reached the endpoint when they were last under follow-up. You can assess visually whether the different groups achieve the endpoint at different rates, but formal tests are required to see if there are any significant differences in progression rates between the groups. This is usually by using the logrank test, which compares events occurring at all time points on the survival curve (rather than median survival).  The Mann-Whitney U test is used to compare two independent groups where there is one numerical or ordinal variable of interest, where the data is not necessarily normally distributed ('non-parametric'). The unpaired t-test is the equivalent test used where the variable is normally distributed in each group and the variances of the two groups are the same. Neither are appropriate to compare survival;you would have to compare the mean/median which oversimplifies the data and may not result in an accurate reflection of the differences between the two groups.   Mean and median survival will give 'average' survival, and will be similar if the data is normally distributed. Survial data is normally skewed however, therefore median survival is a more appropriate measure to use rather than mean."

Prospective trials, observational and cross-sectional studies all provide vital information which guides our daily decision making. Evidence based medicine is a guide only and we should not assume that all patients should be treated according to the results of clinical trials - each patient is an individual, and we should never forget this.

preventive medicine,161,Which of the following is a likely explanation for the high prevalence of cystic fibrosis in European populations?,Heterozygotes may have an advantage because of increased resistance to cholera,Inbreeding is common among Europeans,Many different mutations can cause cystic fibrosis,Most of the disease genes are hidden in heterozygotes,The locus has a high mutation rate,A,"The prevalence of the cystic fibrosis gene at around 1 in 20 of the population would suggest that this provides some evolutionary survival advantage. Like sickle cell trait offering a survival advantage to malaria, it is believed that the cystic fibrosis gene offers a possible survival advantage against cholera and enteropathogenic bacteria.  andquot;Cholera opens chloride channels, letting chloride and water leave cells. The CFTR protein does just the opposite, closing chloride channels and trapping salt and water in cells, which dries out mucus and other secretions. A person with CF cannot contract cholera, because the toxin cannot open the chloride channels in the small intestine. Carriers of CF enjoy the mixed blessing of a balanced polymorphism. They do not have enough abnormal chloride channels to cause the labored breathing and clogged pancreas of cystic fibrosis, but they do have enough of a defect to prevent the cholera from taking hold. During the devastating cholera epidemics that have peppered history, individuals carrying mutant CF alleles had a selective advantage, and they disproportionately transmitted those alleles to future generations. However, because CF arose in Western Europe and cholera in Africa, perhaps an initial increase in CF herterozygosity was a response to a different diarrheal infection.andquot;^1  "

It is also not really valid to look at the intervention without any form of comparator. National targets do not take account of local factors such as deprivation, ethnic mix or resource provision; and as such, the most appropriate design is to determine the effect of the intervention in surgeries versus local controls, matched where possible for other resources, ethnic mix, age mix and level of social deprivation."
preventive medicine,163,"In a randomised controlled trial of comparing drug A (group A) and placebo (group B) for the treatment of diabetes mellitus, it was found that the HbA1c was 54 mmol/mol in group A and 65 mmol/mol in group B (p=0.02). In subgroup analysis, the HbA1c was 52 mmol/mol for hypertensive patients in group A and 59 mmol/mol for hypertensive patients in group B (p=0.01). The HbA1c was 59 mmol/mol for normotensive patients in group A and 70 mmol/mol for normotensive patients in group B (p=0.1). Which of the following statements is correct?",Drug A is effective for lowering HbA1c in hypertensive patients only,Drug A is more effective for lowering HbA1c compared to placebo,Drug A is more effective for lowering HbA1c in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive patients,Drug A is not effective for lowering HbA1c in normotensive patients,Hypertension affects the response of diabetic patients to drug A,B,"Drug A is more effective for lowering HbA1c compared to placebo. Based on the p value of 0.02, there is evidence that drug A is more effective for lowering HbA1c compared to placebo. Drug A is effective overall (54 vs 65 mmol/mol, p=0.02), not just hypertensive patients. Although drug A appears effective in hypertensive patients and not normotensive patients, it remains uncertain whether drug A is more effective for lowering HbA1c in hypertensive patients compared to normotensive patients unless a significant interaction effect between blood pressure and treatment is demonstrated. To determine whether hypertension really affects response to drug A requires testing the interaction effect between blood pressure status and treatment. Lack of convincing evidence supporting effectiveness of drug A in normotensive patients doesn't mean that there is convincing evidence that drug A is ineffective in this group of patients."

The 115 subjects put through programme B showed an increase in their mean IQ score of 4. The p value was greater than0.05. Which of the following is true?,Even though the difference between the means is not significant it would be appropriate to calculate confidence intervals,The above results would be found by chance in less than 1:20,The distribution of individual values is not important,The numbers are too large for a Student's t test,The study demonstrates the usefulness of programme A,A,Even though the difference between the means is not significant it would be appropriate to calculate confidence intervals. This gives us an idea of the distribution of the data. Confidence intervals may provide more meaningful data concerning the study. The chances are greater than 1 in 20 as P is greater than 0.05.

To determine the effectiveness of the test, the results were compared against colonoscopy and biopsy, the combination of which is considered the gold standard investigation. The results of the test are shown below:      Biopsy proven Biopsy negative   Test positive 510 50   Test negative 10 70    Which of the following is the negative predictive value for this test?",9.80%,10%,88%,91%,98%,C,"The answer is 88%. The negative predictive value is the number of true negatives divided by the number of true negatives + the number of false negatives. In this case this is 70 / (70+10) = 88%. The sensitivity of this test is true positives / (true positives + false negatives) = 510 / (510+10)= 98%.  The specificity is calculated as true negatives / (true negatives + false positives) = 70 / (70+50) = 58%. The positive predictive value is defined as true positives / (true positives + false positives) = 510 / (510+50) = 91%.  Ideally, to introduce a screening test both sensitivity and specificity should be as high as possible. In this case, the relatively low specificity raises some concerns about its utility."

After randomising the patients, a small proportion of the drug plus physiotherapy group decide to drop out of the study or omit some treatment sessions specified in the research protocol. What is the correct way of analysing the subsequent data?",Assume the patients have withdrawn their consent,Exclude these patients from all analysis,Extend the trial recruitment to make up the numbers,Include these patient outcomes in the drug plus physiotherapy group,Interview the patients and report their group separately,D,This is the principle of 'intention to treat'. It is possible that the physiotherapy intervention was harmful to the patients and this is why they left. Intention to treat helps to reduce bias by sticking to the original allocation of treatment and analysing the patient in that treatment group even if they do not recieve the treatment.

Which of the following statements is correct?",A confidence interval for the sensitivity value should also be reported,A p value for the sensitivity should also be reported,A sensitivity of 85% is too low to be of clinical value,The specificity is more useful than sensitivity in diagnosis,The study should also include non-thyrotoxic patients to reduce bias,A,"A confidence interval is needed for almost all statistical estimates, including sensitivity or specificity of a diagnostic test. The confidence interval will provide the readers an interval estimate wherein the true sensitivity may lie. A p value can only be given if there is hypothesis testing. In this situation there is no null or alternative hypothesis to be tested and no p value is needed. Whether a test is clinically valuable or useful depends on other factors and should not be determined by the numerical value of sensitivity alone. Both sensitivity and specificity are useful. Which one is considered more important depends on the clinical context and the purpose of the test. Since the aim of the study is to investigate the use of the test in patients with clinical evidence of thyrotoxicosis, involvement of other patients is unnecessary."

preventive medicine,193,In a trial using regimen A for the treatment of 100 patients with adrenal carcinoma it was found that the five year overall survival was 60%. The hazard ratio for obese patients compared to non-obese patients was 0.7 (p = 0.01) Which of the following statements is correct?,Obese patients are more likely to die from adrenal carcinoma,Obesity is a significant poor prognostic factor for adrenal carcinoma,Obesity is a significant risk factor for adrenal carcinoma,The five year survival of obese patients is greater than 60%,The five year survival of obese patients is less than 60%,D,The hazard ratio is less than 1. This means that obese patients have lower mortality and higher survival than non-obese patients. Therefore the survival rate in obese patients should be higher than 60% and the survival rate in non-obese patients should be lower than 60%. Obesity is a favourable prognostic factor according to the data. We cannot judge from the data whether obesity is a risk factor for adrenal carcinoma or not.

In a double blind placebo control clinical trial all of the patients are blind to the treatment choice so it would be incorrect to say that only half of the patients do not know which treatment they receive. If some of the patients are not treated it could clearly not be considered a blind trial since these patients would be aware that they were not being treated. The correct answer is that the clinician assessing the effects of the treatment does not know which treatment the patient has been given. In a double blind placebo control clinical trial the clinician is blind to the treatment choice.

preventive medicine,200,Which of the following is true regarding hospital acquired infections?,Gram‐negative organisms are usually spread by the aerosol route,Contaminated equipment is a higher infection risk if dry,Sterilisation may leave some bacterial spores intact,Contact between individuals is an unlikely route of infection,"Theatre air systems generate a sub‐atmospheric pressure, relative to the surroundings",A,"Person to person contact is a very common cause of infection spread in hospitals, which explains why scrupulous hygiene when moving between patients on an ITU is essential.If an item of equipment is contaminated with bacteria, the number of bacteria will usually remain constant, or decline, if the item is dry. If the item is wet, some bacteria, (e.g. Pseudomonas), may multiply.Aerosols caused by air‐conditioning units are notorious for spreading Gram‐negative bacteria, (e.g. coliforms and Legionella).Sterilisation renders an article sterile and infection free, and the process includes the destruction of bacterial spores.Theatre air systems generate a positive pressure compared to the surroundings (not sub‐ atmospheric). The positive pressure air is moved away from the patient and filtered, so that airborne infections are prevented from reaching the patient. The laminar flow used in orthopaedic theatre is the logical progression of this concept."

The sample size of 200 patients is not bad. There is no absolute criterion to judge whether the sample size is sufficient. However, since the p value is below 0.05, the sample size is sufficient to detect the difference between drug A and placebo. Although drug A appears effective, whether we should use it also depends on other factors, such as safety and cost. Placebo seems to work in this case but we are uncertain without a formal statistical test on the placebo effect. In general, a randomised controlled trial eliminates confounding by known and unknown factors. Whether the trial is well conducted requires other information in addition to the description of double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, such as description of random sequence generation and allocation concealment and co-interventions, etc."

The correlation coefficient was 0.6. Which of the following statements is correct?",Decreasing the sample size will decrease the validity of the results,Decreasing the sample size will increase the standard deviation of the correlation coefficient,Decreasing the sample size will increase the width of the 95% confidence interval of the correlation coefficient,The correlation between waist circumference and systolic blood pressure is linear,The correlation coefficient is significant,C,"Decreasing the sample size will increase the standard error of the correlation coefficient and hence the confidence interval will widen. Therefore, decreasing the sample size will increase the width of the 95% confidence interval of the correlation coefficient. The validity of a study does not depend on its sample size. The correlation coefficient does not have a standard deviation but it has a standard error. The correlation is not necessarily linear, although the Pearson correlation coefficient is estimated under the assumption that the correlation is linear. Without statistical test of significance, we are uncertain whether the correlation is significant or not."

Approximately which of the following values reflects the negative predictive value of the new technique?,33%,50%,66%,90%,It cannot be determined,E,"The negative predictive value is used to describe the performance of a diagnostic testing procedure, and is defined as the proportion of subjects with a negative test result who are correctly diagnosed as such. A high negative predictive value means that when the test yields a negative results, it is most likely correct in its assessment.  The negative predictive value is calculated by dividing the number of true negatives by the number of true negatives and number of false negatives. In this example, we know that 100 patients tested positive with the gold standard technique, and only 50 with the new technique. However, we do not know whether all these 50 tested positive with the gold standard technique, or whether some of these are false positives. Therefore we do not have the values for true negatives, or false negatives, and cannot therefore calculate the negative predictive value."

Which one of the following would suggest that the link is causative?,The finding of similar odds ratios for osteoarthritis in thesame environment,The finding of similar results in a number of studies,The finding that increasing consumption is associated with adecreased rate of disease,The finding of a number of different histological types ofoesophageal carcinoma in the cluster,An odds ratio of 2:1,B,"Criteria for assessing causation include:∙ Strength ‐ strong associations are more likely than weak ones.∙ Consistency ‐ multiple studies finding the same thing are more likely to be causal. ∙ Specificity ‐ if a variable is associated with a single outcome, and the outcome is associated with only a single possible cause, then the relationship is more likely to be causal.∙ Temporality ‐ causes must precede effects. This is absolutely necessary to suggest causation.∙ Biological gradient ‐ if an increased exposure is associated with an increased rate or severity of disease, then causality is more likely.∙ Plausibility ‐ hypotheses should sound reasonable. However, new epidemiological findings may expand knowledge.∙ Coherence ‐ causal association is strengthened if epidemiological data fit in with pathology.∙ Experiment ‐ if the cause is removed and disease frequency declines, the likelihood of a causal link is strengthened.∙ Analogy ‐ if a similar association has been shown to be causal, then the association under investigation is more likely to be causal."
preventive medicine,270,A study was performed to assess the usefulness of a new autoantibody test for the detection of suspected Hashimoto's disease. The test was undertaken in 1000 subjects who complained of tiredness and all test results were compared with FNA biopsy results which provided a gold standard for the diagnosis of Hashimoto's disease.,60%,70%,50%,80%,90%,B,"The sensitivity of a test is the ability of a test to identify those with the condition.In this example, 50 individuals had Hashimoto's disease according to the gold standard test of biopsy, with 35 of these being identified by the antibody test.Sensitivity is calculated as true positive / (true positive + false negative). Thus: Sensitivity = 35/(35+15) = 70%."
preventive medicine,271,A 96 week study compared two regimens of antiretroviral medication for HIV infection. The null hypothesis was that there was no difference between the two regimens. The primary outcome was reduction of HIV viral load below 50 copies per ml. This outcome was reached in 90% of patients taking regimen A and 93% of patients taking regimen B. The results were reported as being significant with a p-value of 0.05. Which of these is the correct interpretation of the P value?,Regimen B is 5% better than regimen A,There is a 5% chance that regimen B is better than regimen A,There is a 20% chance that regimen B is better than regimen A,There is a 5% probability of finding this result if there is no difference between the regimens,There is a 20% probability of finding this result if there is no difference between the regimens,D,This is a very important point for anyone who reads about P values and also one of the most misunderstood. It is important not to over-interpret the P value. All it tells you is the probability that the results could have occurred by chance if there was no difference between the regimens. It does not tell you the chance that one regimen is actually better than another or the magnitude of that difference. Confusion over this point is one reason why confidence intervals are now often quoted rather than P values.

It was reported that the likelihood ratio of a positive test for the new marker was 10. Which of the following statements about the likelihood of a positive test is correct?",The likelihood ratio of positive test will decrease if the sensitivity of the test is increased,The likelihood ratio of positive test will decrease if the specificity of the test is increased,The likelihood ratio of positive test will increase if the prevalence of the disease is increased,The likelihood ratio of positive test will increase if the sensitivity of the test is increased,The likelihood ratio of positive test will increase if the specificity of the test is decreased,D,"The likelihood ratio of a positive test = sensitivity / (1−specificity). If the sensitivity increases, the likelihood ratio of a positive test will increase. If the specificity decreases, the likelihood ratio of a positive test will decrease. The prevalence usually will not affect the sensitivity or specificity of a test significantly. Therefore, change in prevalence usually will not change the likelihood ratio of a positive test."
preventive medicine,273,Which of the following is true in statistics?,The standard deviation is the square root of the variance,"In a positively skewed distribution, the mean always lies to the left of the mode","In parametric data, the mode is usually different in value from the mean",The median is the most commonly occurring value,"In distributions which are markedly skewed, the arithmetic mean is a more appropriate measure than the geometric mean",A,"In positively skewed data the mean usually lies to the right of the mode.In skewed data, the geometric mean is the most appropriate measure.Mode refers to the most frequently encountered value and in normally distributed data coincides with the mean and median values.Standard deviation (SD) is a measure of the deviation (variance) of the recorded values from the mean and is therefore a measure of the distribution of the data. It is the positive square root of the variance."

The placebo effect is often higher - of the order or 20-30%. 'Probable error' is meaningless; standard error is derived from the variance. It is true that the result may have occurred by chance alone in less than one in 20 occasions. This is the meaning of the 'p value'. 0.05 = 1/20. It is also true that the result should be regarded as reaching conventional levels of statistical significance. p less than0.05 is the conventional level of statistical significance. In this scenario it is not true that the trial was well designed. This could only be stated with far more information about the study and its conduct.
preventive medicine,275,Which of the following studies is most appropriate to assess a diagnostic test?,Randomised Control Trial,Case Control Studies,Regression Analytics,Cohort Study,Cross Sectional Analysis,E,Medics often think that RCT's are the gold standard of all studies. In terms of evaluating a therapy or intervention RCTs are the gold standard and top the hierarchy of evidence. This is not the case when evaluating diagnostic tests or assessing prognosis.

However, 30% of those examined were subsequently lost to follow-up. Which one of the following statements is correct?",The incidence of arthritis may be underestimated in this study,The incomplete response at entry and follow-up introduces information bias,The power of the study to assess the association between physical activity and incidence of musculoskeletal problems is unaffected by incomplete follow-up,The prevalence of arthritis will be overestimated in this study,The prognosis of joint disease can be reliably assessed from this study,A,"Information bias relates to the way questions within the questionnaire may be worded or the way subjects are provided with information concerning the trial which may influence the way they respond. As the response to the questionnaire is not complete, then potentially both the incidence and the prevalence of arthritis may be underestimated. Again, the power is reduced due to the loss of follow-up data. Prognosis cannot be determined from this type of study which is more an assessment of prevalence/incidence."

preventive medicine,283,You are reading an article for journal club that suggests that there is a link between exposure to radiation in utero and childhood cancer. You are concerned that the loss to follow up in the study is very high and worry that this may invalidate the study results. Loss to follow up can be regarded as a type of which of the following?,Chance error,Confounding,Measurement bias,Publication bias,Selection bias,E,"Bias is a systematic error that leads to an incorrect estimate of effect or association in a study. Different types of bias include selection bias, publication bias and measurement bias. Selection bias occurs when the groups to be compared are different, which may result in the subjects being studied being unrepresentative of the population. If those who are lost to follow up in a study differ systemically in some way from those who are analysed, then selection bias will have occurred. Measurement bias occurs when study variables are systematically inaccurately measured. Examples of measurement bias are recall bias or instrument error. Publication bias occurs when a study with 'positive' results are more likely to be published. In epidemiology a confounder is:  Not part of the causal relationship between exposure and disease Predicts disease Unequally distributed between exposure groups.  A confounder can only be controlled for if it is known and measurable. Confounding occurs when an observed association is distorted because the exposure is also correlated with another risk factor The second risk factor is also associated with the outcome, but independently of the exposure under investigation. Loss to follow up is a type of bias, that is, a systematic error and not a chance error."
preventive medicine,284,Which of the following statements regarding mortality rates is correct?,Crude mortality rates are calculated only from death certificate data,"In males over the age of 15 years, age specific death rates increase by 10-20% over each subsequent five year period",Provide little important information about the changing pattern of disease in society,The standardised mortality ratio is the unexpected number of deaths divided by observed number of deaths for a specified group,They are usually standardised for age and sex,E,"Mortality rates are a very important source of information about the changing pattern of disease in a country. Most countries have a death certification system, and data from this source can be combined with population census information to calculate a crude mortality rate. The crude mortality rate = deaths occurring over a one year period divided by the number in the population at midpoint of the year, multiplied by 1,000. Mortality rates are better expressed as age specific death for males and females and are usually started at 15-19 years, and increased in five year intervals. There is little change in the age specific mortality rate between 15 and 34 years. After 45 years it approximately doubles over each five year period. The standardised mortality ratio (SMR) is a ratio of expected deaths in an age group (calculated from age specific death rates) divided by the actual number of deaths in a specific group within that age group."

preventive medicine,292,A trial is to be set up to examine a new drug for the maintenance of remission in all people with ulcerative colitis. A randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial recruits patients in hospital with an exacerbation of their ulcerative colitis. A standard questionnaire is used to record the frequency of exacerbations of disease over a two year period. Results show that there is no difference between the drug and placebo and the results are published in a medical journal. To which form of bias is this study most susceptible?,Allocation bias,Assessment bias,Observer bias,Recall bias,Selection bias,E,Bias occurs when there is a systematic difference between the results from a randomised controlled trial and the true state of affairs. In this case the study population (people in hospital with a flare of UC) is different from the population to whom the results will be applied (all people who have UC) and there is therefore said to be a selection bias.  Allocation bias occurs when patients are not randomly assigned to a particular treatment. Assessment bias occurs when the observer knows which treatment the subject is taking. Observer bias is when one observer consistently under or over reports a particular variable.  Recall bias applies to case-control studies when a patient is more likely to remember a particular detail of exposure if they go on to develop the disease.  It has been argued that the early results of trials of HRT demonstrating potentially positive results on reduction in cardiovascular risk are related to selection bias as women of higher social classes who exercised more were likely to choose HRT.

What is the specificity of the test?,0%,100%,98%,20%,2%,C,"Specificity is defined as the proportion of individuals who do not have the condition who are correctly identified by the test.In this case 980 out of the 1000 subjects were correctly identified as not being pregnant and 20 were incorrectly identified as being pregnant. So, we calculate as:Specificity = True Negative / (False Positive + True Negative)Specificity = 980/(20+980) = 98%Highly specific tests such as this are useful for ruling conditions in, that is, the person is very likely to have the disease if the test is positive.Note that tests with 100% sensitivity and/or specificity are rare and this includes pregnancy tests."
preventive medicine,306,"A cohort study of 7,500 patients aimed to find out whether the use of olive oil in cooking has an impact on cardiovascular disease. Approximately half the patients used olive oil in cooking and half used animal fat. Which of these is a disadvantage of a cohort study?",It is not possible to measure the incidence/risk of a disease,They are not suitable when exposure to risk factors is rare,They are susceptible to recall bias; there is a differential ability of patients to remember exposure to a risk factor,They can only provide information about one outcome,When the outcome of interest is rare a very large sample size is needed,E,"A cohort study takes a group of individuals and follows them for a period of time, the aim being to study whether the exposure to a particular aetiological factor has any effect on the incidence of disease. As such they are relatively time consuming and expensive to perform. Advantages include being able to study exposure factors that are rare and being less susceptible to recall bias than case-control studies. They are also able to measure the incidence/risk of a disease. Results are usually expressed as the relative risk of developing the disease given exposure to the aetiological factor.

preventive medicine,307,"In a study to find out if concentration of drug X is related to weight, subjects were given 500 mg of the drug and serum levels were measured two hours later. Which of the following is the best statistical test to evaluate the results?",Chi squared test,Log regression analysis,Pearson's coefficient,Student's paired t test,Student's unpaired t test,C,Drug concentrations are measured two hours after consumption and the variable of weight is to be factored in on the drugs pharmacokinetics. Therefore there are two variables to be compared and consequently the most appropriate statistical test would be Pearson's test. Logistic regression is used to model dichotomous (0 or 1) outcomes. This technique models the log odds of an outcome defined by the values of covariates in your model. Further information on statistical testing can be found here: Scribbr: Statistical tests: which one should you use?

preventive medicine,309,"You are studying the measurement of a new biomarker for cardiovascular disease, and how it might be applied to general practice. You assume that the data for this particular biomarker are likely to be normally distributed. When considering the normal distribution, which of the following is true?",95% of observations lie within the mean and 1 standard deviation,Data need to be transformed before they can be analysed with parametric tests,Data with a tail of values which is greater than the upper end of the distribution are normally distributed,"The mean, median and mode are the same value",The 95% confidence interval tells us how confident we are in the test,D,"The mean and median and mode of a normal distribution are equal, because the distribution curve of a normal distribution is bell shaped and equal on both sides. The probability that a normally distributed random variable x, with mean sigma, and standard deviation µ, lies between (sigma - 1.96 µ) and (sigma + 1.96 µ) is 0.95. The probability that a normally distributed random variable x, with mean sigma, and standard deviation µ, lies between (sigma - µ) and (sigma + µ) is 0.68. Ninety five per cent of the distribution of sample means lie within 1.96 standard deviations of the population mean. A parametric test is a statistical test which assumes the data are normally distributed. Data which are not normally distributed can still be subject to a parametric test, but it need to be transformed first."
preventive medicine,310,"In a chronic disease which has no known effective treatment, a new treatment is known to be effective in animal models and shows promise in short term studies in patients. There are some theoretical concerns about toxicity involving liver and bone marrow although no cases have been observed in studies so far. What is the most appropriate next step in the drug's development?",Case-control study,No further studies should be done and drug development should be stopped,Open study,Randomised double blind placebo controlled study,Randomised single blind placebo controlled study,D,"The story that is described is of an early drug development that has gone through phase I trials (normal volunteers) and phase II studies (more normal volunteers but it also mentions 'studies in patients'). The next step in the development of this drug is a phase III study - where the drug's efficacy and safety should be tested against a placebo. Broadly, the development of a new drug can be divided into pre-clinical and clinical trials. Pre-clinical development first involves identifying the target thought to be important in disease. Drug candidates are then identified, and their properties optimised. Pre-clinical safety studies are then conducted to determine dosage, ensure safety and study pharmacokinetic properties. These involve both computer and animal models. All information gathered from pre-clinical testing is submitted to the regulatory authorities, prior to moving to the clinical phase of drug development. Clinical trials have a number of phases:  In phase I the drug is usually given to healthy volunteers to determine its safety and pharmacokinetic properties in humans. In phase II a small group of patients (typically 100-250) are given the drug to evaluate its efficacy, optimum dose, safety and side effects (as these may be different in patients compared to healthy volunteers). If these trials are successful larger clinical trials can be planned. Phase III trials typically involve more than 1000 patients, and are used to determine efficacy and side effects. If successful the drug must be registered by the authorities prior to being released to the market.  It is important to note the majority of drugs identified in early pre-clinical trials will never make it to market, as they are not shown to have a significant effect or they are associated with significant toxicity. Post-marketing studies then continue to determine the long term and chronic toxicities. UK practitioners are requested to report any side effects via the yellow card scheme."

preventive medicine,315,A new diagnostic test for malabsorption has been analysed and the results have yielded the following 2×2 contingency table:,24%,64%,48%,16%,80%,B,"This question tests understanding of pre‐test and post‐test odds, likelihood ratios, sensitivity and specificity. Getting it right requires you to recognise that the prevalence of the condition is different in population from which the contingency table was produced (55%) as compared to the population from which the patient in question comes (20%).You are being asked to calculate the positive post‐test probability ‐ i.e. the likelihood that a patient has the condition in question given a positive test. Where there is nothing to suggest that an individual's likelihood of having a particular condition is any different from the reference population then the positive predictive value may be used as an estimate of the positive post‐test probability however this is not the case here. As a result you are required to calculate likelihood ratios and take account of the prevalence of the condition within the new test population.The calculation is as follows:Sensitivity = A /(A + C) = 90 /(90 + 20) = 0.818Specificity = D /(B + D) = 80 /(10 + 80) = 0.889Likelihood ratio for a positive test (LR+) = sensitivity/(1 − specificity) = 0.818 / (1 − 0.889) = 7.2 Pre‐test odds = prevalence/(1 − prevalence) = 0.2 / (1 − 0.2) = 0.25Post‐test odds = pre‐test odds × LR+ = 0.25 × 7.2 = 1.8Post‐test probability = post‐test odds / (post‐test odds + 1) = 1.8 / (1.8 + 1) = 0.64Disease PresentDisease Not PresentTest +vetrue positive (A)false positive (B)Test ‐vefalse negative (C)true negative (D)The following are formulas for calculating various common statistical values used in understanding the value of diagnostic tests:Sensitivity (how much a test is positive in disease) = A / (A + C)Specificity (how much a test is negative in health) = D / (B + D)Positive predictive value = A / (A + B)Negative predictive value = D / (C + D)Pre‐test odds = the odds of having the disease before you do the test (for example, your rule‐ of‐thumb guestimate or the prevalence of the disease in the population or based on clinical findings, etc.)Post‐test odds = the odds of having the disease after you did the testSystematic error = (A + B) / (A + C) Likelihood ratio (LR) + (the ratio of the chance of having a positive test if the disease is present to the chance of having a positive test if the disease is absent) = sensitivity / (1 − specificity)LR‐ = (1 − sensiƟvity) / specificityLikelihood ratios are good for:∙ Directly calculating post‐test odds∙ Tests with multiple levels (that is, not just +ve or ‐ve).

What are the axes of the curve?,Specificity v Sensitivity,Sensitivity v Specificity,Positive Predictive Value v Negative Predictive Value,(1-Sensitivity) v Specificity,Sensitivity v (1-Specificty),E,ROC Curves plot Sensitivity against 1-Specificty as shown in the diagram below. They are a useful measure of how good a test is at distinguishing those with and without disease. The greater the area under the curve the better the test. A common question is why not plot sensitivity vs specificity.

preventive medicine,320,"The CAPRIE study looked at whether aspirin or clopidogrel was most appropriate in patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease to prevent the MACE composite endpoint, which consists of stroke, MI or cardiovascular death, re-hospitalisation, or bleeding. A sub-study looked at 3,866 patients with a history of diabetes and found an event rate of 17.7% for patients taking aspirin, versus 15.6% for patients taking clopidogrel. Which of the following is the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one event for patients taking clopidogrel versus aspirin?",2.1,15.6/17.7,100/2.1,100/15.6,100/17.7,C,"The number needed to treat to prevent one specified outcome event is 100 divided by the absolute risk reduction, in this case 17.7-15.6%= 2.1%. This equals 48, meaning that 48 patients need to be treated with clopidogrel versus aspirin to prevent one stroke, MI cardiovascular death, bleed or hospitalisation. For many studies now, papers quote the number needed to harm. This uses the same principle to establish the difference in absolute risk of an adverse event occurring between two treatment strategies, calculating a number needed to harm by dividing 100 by the absolute risk. Calculation of both number needed to treat and number needed to harm for a new therapy allows clinicians to establish net clinical benefit. "

Publication bias can be examined by funnel plots if a sufficient number of studies is found. Asymmetrical funel plots give suspicion of publicaiton bias.  Non-randomised or other studies may or may not be included. However, randomised controlled trials usually have lower risk of bias and hence give us more confidence about validity of results and are preferred primary sources for systematic review. The result of study 1 has higher statistical significance, which means less likely to be observed by chance alone.

A cohort is identified, for whom records of exposure status are available from the past, and whose disease experience can now be measured, a substantial period of time having already elapsed since exposure. An example of a famous cohort study in medicine is the Framingham study."

preventive medicine,341,"In a primary prevention study of stroke comparing a new antihypertensive with conventional antihypertensive therapy, the number of patients who had a stroke over the study period was 200 in group 1 with the new therapy (n = 5200) versus 250 with conventional therapy (n = 4750). Which of the following is the approximate odds ratio for the new therapy?",0.25,0.5,0.72,1,1.5,C,"An odds ratio is the ratio of the odds of the outcome in the two groups. Studies generally try to identify factors that cause harm - those with odds ratios greater than one. In order to calculate the odds ratio you need:  a. The number of positive cases in the first group (in this example - the number of strokes) b. The number of positive cases in the second group c. The number of negative cases in the first group d. The number of negative cases in the second group  The odds ratio is then calculated using the formula (a/c) / (b/d). In this example, this is (200/5000) / (250/4500), which is 0.04 / 0.056, which equals 0.72."
preventive medicine,342,"In a case-control study on the association between cola drinking and type 2 diabetes (T2D), 100 patients with T2D and 100 healthy controls were recruited. It was reported that the crude odds ratio of T2D in people who drank cola daily as compared to those who did not drink cola was 1.4 (95% confidence interval 1.1-1.7). The odds ratio was 1.2 (95% confidence interval 0.9-1.6) after adjustment for body mass index. Which of the following statements is true?",BMI is likely to be a confounding variable,The p value for the adjusted odds ratio should be below 0.05,The p value for the crude odds ratio should be above 0.05,The result from this case-control study is unreliable,There is evidence of interaction between weight and cola drinking in the association with T2D,A,"Since BMI alters the crude odds ratio of cola drinking after its adjustment, BMI is likely to be a confounding variable. The 95% confidence interval of the adjusted odds ratio includes 1. This means the association is not statistically significant and therefore the p value should be above 0.05. The 95% confidence interval of the crude odds ratio does not include 1. This means the association is statistically significant and therefore the p value should be below 0.05. Although case-control study can have various sources of bias, whether this study is reliable or not also depends on other factors, which are not given in the question. To determine whether there is interaction between BMI and cola drinking in the association with T2D, stratified data analysis or multivariable analysis is essential. This cannot be concluded from the data provided. To give a hypothetical example of a confounding variable: A study shows that wearing sunglasses and putting on sun cream are linked - increases in sun cream sales are higher when sales of sunglasses increase. It could be that sun cream makes individuals wear sunglasses or that wearing sunglasses reminds people that they need to put on sun cream. However, there is a third andquot;confoundingandquot; variable that affects BOTH sales of sunglasses and sun cream - the weather.

Getting it right requires you to recognise that the prevalence of the condition is different in population from which the contingency table was produced (55%) as compared to the population from which the patient in question comes (20%). You are being asked to calculate the positive post-test probability - i.e. the likelihood that a patient has the condition in question given a positive test. Where there is nothing to suggest that an individual's likelihood of having a particular condition is any different from the reference population then the positive predictive value may be used as an estimate of the positive post-test probability however this is not the case here. As a result you are required to calculate likelihood ratios and take account of the prevalence of the condition within the new test population. The calculation is as follows: Sensitivity = A /(A + C) = 90 /(90 + 20) = 0.818 Specificity = D /(B + D) = 80 /(10 + 80) = 0.889 Likelihood ratio for a positive test (LR+) = sensitivity/(1 − specificity) = 0.818 / (1 − 0.889) = 7.2 Pre-test odds = prevalence/(1 − prevalence) = 0.2 / (1 − 0.2) = 0.25 Post-test odds = pre-test odds × LR+ = 0.25 × 7.2 = 1.8 Post-test probability = post-test odds / (post-test odds + 1) = 1.8 / (1.8 + 1) = 0.64      Disease Present Disease Not Present   Test +ve true positive (A) false positive (B)   Test -ve false negative (C) true negative (D)    The following are formulas for calculating various common statistical values used in understanding the value of diagnostic tests: Sensitivity (how much a test is positive in disease) = A / (A + C) Specificity (how much a test is negative in health) = D / (B + D) Positive predictive value = A / (A + B) Negative predictive value = D / (C + D) Pre-test odds = the odds of having the disease before you do the test (for example, your rule-of-thumb guestimate or the prevalence of the disease in the population or based on clinical findings, etc.) Post-test odds = the odds of having the disease after you did the test Systematic error = (A + B) / (A + C) Likelihood ratio (LR) + (the ratio of the chance of having a positive test if the disease is present to the chance of having a positive test if the disease is absent) = sensitivity / (1 − specificity) LR- = (1 − sensitivity) / specificity Likelihood ratios are good for:  Directly calculating post-test odds Tests with multiple levels (that is, not just +ve or -ve).

The additional cost of the new treatment is £3000 per patient. In the first year of treatment, what would be the predicted additional cost of preventing a single recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage?",£3000,"£12,000","£30,000","£75,000","£90,000",D,"This study shows that annual rate of recurrent subarachnoid haemorrhage is reduced from 10% to 6%. Therefore, if you treated 100 patients for one year you would expect 10 patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage in the medically treated group versus six patients in the medical plus radiological intervention group - a reduction of four patients per hundred. Therefore you would need to treat 25 patients (100/4) to expect one less case of subarachnoid haemorrhage. Thus the extra cost of this would be 25 × 3000 = £75,000."
preventive medicine,373,A trial is proposed to see whether excess alcohol use is a risk factor for osteoporosis. It is decided to perform a case-control study rather than a cohort study. Which of these is an advantage of a case-control study?,It can provide information on a wide range of outcomes,It is expensive to perform,It is possible to measure the incidence of a disease directly,It is possible to study diseases that are rare,The time sequence of events can be assessed,D,"A case-control study compares the characteristics of a group of patients with the disease with a control group of patients who do not have the disease. Advantages of case-control studies are that:  They are particularly suitable for rare diseases A wide range of risk factors can be investigated There is no loss to follow up, and They are relatively cheap and quick to perform.  Results are usually quoted as an odds ratio."
preventive medicine,374,A publication reports the outcome of a new statin therapy in a placebo controlled primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease in a diabetic population. 1000 patients were randomised to receive the new therapy and 1000 allocated to placebo. The study was completed over a five year period. In the placebo group there were 150 myocardial infarcts (MI) and in the group treated with the new statin there were 100 myocardial infarcts. What is the number needed to treat to prevent one MI over the course of this study?,50,40,20,30,10,C,"You treat 1000 patients for five years with the new statin and prevent 50 MIs. Thus the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one MI is 20 (1000/50).This statistical figure provides us with a lot of information regarding the efficacy of a treatment rather than purely statistically significant data.As it stands, you may expect to prevent an infarct by treating as few as 20 patients over five years from these data.Furthermore, cost economic data can be calculated from such results by factoring in how much the drug costs against all the costs of treating and rehabilitating a patient with an MI."

Which of the following can you deduce about the test, based on these figures?",The likelihood ratio cannot be determined from the information given,The positive predictive value is probably higher than the negative predictive value,The positive predictive value is probably lower than the negative predictive value,The threshold serum procalcitonin level at 0.5 microgram/L is probably better at ruling in bacteraemia than ruling it out,The threshold serum procalcitonin level at 0.5 microgram/L is probably better at ruling out bacteraemia than ruling it in,D,"The rule of thumb is that a high sensitivity helps to rule out disease (SnOut) and a high specificity helps to rule in (SpIn) disease. In this study, the specificity is higher than the sensitivity. Therefore the test is more helpful is ruling in the disease (bacteraemia). The relative strengths of positive and negative predictive values cannot be determined by sensitivity and specificity alone.

The correlation coefficient was +0.5. Which of the following statements is correct?",A 10 mmHg increase in blood pressure is associated with 6 cm decrease in waist circumference,A 10 mmHg increase in blood pressure is associated with 6 cm increase in waist circumference,A higher waist circumference is associated with a higher systolic blood pressure,A higher waist circumference is associated with a lower systolic blood pressure,The association between between waist circumference and systolic blood pressure is linear,C,"A positive correlation is interpreted as the direction of relationship, that is, a higher waist circumference is associated with a higher systolic blood pressure. A negative correlation would imply the opposite. The first two options are incorrect in this case since they are interpretations of regression coefficients, not correlation coefficient. For a higher waist circumference to be associated with a higher systolic blood pressure the correlation coefficient should be positive. The correlation between waist circumference and systolic blood pressure is not necessarily linear, although the correlation coefficient describes the magnitude of linear correlation."

preventive medicine,392,Which of the following is true regarding evidence-based medicine?,Combines clinical expertise and external evidence,Does not involve health economic assessment,Is restricted to randomised placebo-controlled trials,Is used to cut down waiting lists,Tries to rely on subjective measurements of disease outcomes,A,"Health economic assessment is central in evidence-based medicine, especially when making judicious use of current best evidence to make decisions. It includes all trials but one must critically appraise the methods in order to assess the validity of the evidence. It is used to make decisions about the care of individual patients. Objective measurements of disease outcome eliminate bias and are more scientific relative to subjective measures and are therefore applicable to the practice of evidence-based medicine. This combination results in the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients."

From the table above, If a screening test is good at determining true disease positives and negatives, then a and d will be large and b and c will be small. Sensitivity is the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the test. We can determine the sensitivity as follows: a/(a+c). Specificity is the proportion of true negatives correctly identified by the test. We can determine the specificity as follows: d/(b+d). Positive predictive value is those who test positive who are actually obese. We can determine the positive predictive value as follows: a/(a+b). Negative predictive value is those who test negative who are not obese at 8 years of age. We can determine the negative predictive value as follows: d/(c+d). If a screening test is good, it will have a high specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value but there is usually a trade-off between these measures."

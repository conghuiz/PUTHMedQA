basic medicine,1,What genetic mechanism is missing in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum have?,Base excision repair,Transcription coupled repair,Nucleotide excision repair,Homology directed repair,Mismatch repair,C,"Xeroderma pigmentosum is an autosomal recessive disorder in which nucleotide excision repair enzymes are abnormal. UV damage to the DNA is left unrepaired and the incidence of cancers greatly increased. Symptoms include getting sun burnt easily, freckles, rough surfaced growths known as solar keratoses and photophobia."
basic medicine,2,"A 45-year-old man presents with a couple of weeks history of facial swelling and breathlessness. His chest x ray reveals marked mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a mass in the right lower lobe. Subsequent CT chest confirms these findings, and diagnoses superior vena caval obstruction (SVCO).  Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding SVCO?",It may be associated with voice hoarseness,It is associated with Kussmaul's sign,The commonest symptom is stridor,The most common cause is small cell carcinoma of the lung,The treatment of choice is always radiotherapy,A,"SVCO is most commonly caused by mediastinal lymphadenopathy, typically due to lung carcinoma (of which non-small cell is more common than small cell). It can also occur secondary to lymphoma and germ cell tumours. Non-malignant causes include aortic aneurysm, mediastinal fibrosis and a large goitre. The lymphadenopathy can result in a recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, which presents as a hoarse voice. There may also be Horner's syndrome due to involvement of sympathetic chain.  SVCO itself typically presents with insidious onset shortness of breath, which is worse on lying flat. The patients may also have cough and chest pain, due to the distortion of mediastinal anatomy. Physical signs are often absent or minimal, but classically these are facial and periorbital oedema, chemosis and distended chest wall veins. It is associated with an elevated non-pulsatile jugular venous pressure (JVP). Kussmaul's sign is the paradoxical rise in JVP on inspiration due to constrictive pericarditis or significant pericardial effusion. Treatment depends on the underlying cause. If malignant, it also depends on the underlying chemosensitivity of the primary tumour and how unwell the patient is. Steroids (typically dexamethasone) can be given to reduce symptoms whilst specific treatments are commenced. Lymphoma and small cell carcinoma are relatively chemo-sensitive and therefore SVCO can be treated with chemotherapy alone in these settings, but radiotherapy is usually required if the underlying cause is non-small cell lung carcinoma (depending on the extent of disease and the symptoms)."
basic medicine,3,Which bacterium species is resistant to penicillins in over 20% of isolates?,Escherichia coli,Pseudomonas aeroginosa,Beta‐haemolytic streptococci,Neisseria meningitidis,Haemophilus influenzae,A,"Penicillin resistance due to the production of penicillinase is a common problem particularly in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacter which are mostly insensitive.N. meningitidis is generally sensitive and less than 20% resistance is found in Pseudomonas and H. influenzae species.However, the incidence continues to rise."
basic medicine,4,"A 71-year-old man with a history of chronic renal impairment and atrial fibrillation for which he takes warfarin, presents with an acutely tender and red left big toe. Investigations reveal:    Serum creatinine 200 µmol/L (50-100)   Serum urate 0.5 mmol/L (0.12-0.42)    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this man's presentation?",Allopurinol,Colchicine,Diclofenac,Paracetamol,Prednisolone,E,"This man presents with acute gout, has chronic renal impairement, AF and takes warfarin. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) would be the treatment of choice but may cause a deterioration in renal function and would be associated with an increased risk of bleeding in the elderly. The adverse effects of colchicine (especially gastrointestinal symptoms) would be more likely in the elderly and should probably be avoided in those with renal impairment of this degree. Thus steroids are probably the best option. Allopurinol may well precipitate/exacerbate acute gout and is used once the acute attack has settled following adequate treatment. This is a classic MRCP question since it is hard to answer this by just looking in textbooks. Steroids are the last resort choice where NSAIDs and colchicine are deemed too dangerous to use and that is a matter of judgement applied by physicians. There is plenty of evidence for their efficacy."
basic medicine,5,The greater sciatic foramen transmits which of the following?,Nerve to pectineus,Lateral sacral artery,Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh,Sacrospinous ligament,Tendon of obturator internus,C,"The greater sciatic foramen transmits seven nerves (including the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve), three vessels and one muscle (pyriformis).The sacrospinous ligament forms part of the foramen itself.Remember, the nerve to obturator internus passes out through the greater sciatic foramen and then re‐enters through he lesser sciatic foramen onto the pelvic surface of the muscle.The tendon of the obturator internus muscle and its nerve pass through the lesser sciatic foramen.The nerve to pectineus is a branch of the femoral nerve which passes behind the femoral sheath to enter the anterior surface of the muscle."

basic medicine,8,"When the concentration of HCO3- is equal to the concentration of CO2, pH is",1,6.1,7,7.1,6,B,The pH of the bicarbonate buffering system can be calculated from theequation pH = 6.1 + log [HCO3- / CO2].BICARBONATE BUFFERING SYSTEM· Made up of carbonic acid and sodium bicarbonate in extracellular fluid*· Made up of carbonic acid and potassium and magnesium bicarbonate in intracellular fluid *· 399 out of 400 parts of carbonic acid exists as dissolved carbon dioxide. Hence carbonic acid is aweak acid and sodium bicarbonate is a weak base· The pH of the bicarbonate buffer system is calculated from the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation:pH = 6.1 + log[HCO3- / CO2]· Hence the pH of a solution containing an equal concentration of bicarbonate and carbon dioxide is6.1 (log of 1 = 0) = pK of the buffer
basic medicine,9,What is the mechanism of action of carbimazole?,Thyroxine antagonist,Activates thyroid peroxidase,Inhibits iodine binding to thyroglobulin,Blocks iodine receptors,Binds to iodine inhibiting it's uptake,C,Carbimazole is converted to methimazole which prevents thyroid peroxidase from coupling and iodinating the tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin. This leads to a reduction in the production of T3 and T4.
basic medicine,10,A 32-year-old lady is brought to the neurosurgical ward after a subarachnoid haemorrhage is confirmed on CT scan. A small middle cerebral artery aneurysm is subsequently embolised. She later becomes drowsy and less responsive. A repeat CT head shows hydrocephalus and high cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) pressure is confirmed with an opening pressure of 26 cmH2O on lumbar puncture. Roughly what is the normal circulating volume of CSF in an adult?,20 ml,50 ml,150 ml,500 ml,1000 ml,C,"This patient's hydrocephalus is caused by an interruption in circulating CSF reabsorption secondary to the bleed. The normal volume of CSF is approximately 150 ml, although the body will make approximately 500 ml per day. CSF is produced mainly by the choroid plexus. It flows from the lateral ventricles into the third and then fourth ventricles. It then reaches the subarachnoid space. It is reabsorbed into the venous circulation by the arachnoid villi."
basic medicine,11,A lesion of the facial nerve at the origin of the facial canal leads to which of the following?,Associated VIII nerve loss,Loss of secretion of the parotid gland,Loss of sensation on the face,Lower half face paralysis only,Loss of taste on anterior 2/3 tongue,E,"Lower 1/2 face paralysis only is incorrect. It would be a lower motor neurone lesion and therefore affect upper and lower face. Facial nerve paralysis is the commonest of all cranial nerve lesions, the usual type being Bell's palsy where a viral infection causes swelling in the nerve as it passes through the stylomastoid foramen. Associated VIII loss would occur in a cerebellopontine angle tumour. Secretomotor fibres to the parotid gland join the auriculotemporal nerve. Loss of sensation on face is incorrect, although often there is a subjective change to sensation on the face. The correct option is that the anterior 2/3 of the tongue loses taste. The chorda tympani (nervous intermedius fibres) leaves the facial nerve in the facial canal. The taste fibres join the lingual nerve. The nerve to stapedius is also given off in the facial canal. Loss of this nerve may cause hyperacusis."
basic medicine,12,Which of the following is true regarding anaemia after partial gastrectomy?,Is usually due to iron deficiency,Is more common after Billroth I than Polya operations,May be due to folate deficiency,May result from malabsorption,Occurs in approximately 10% of untreated patients after three years,D,"Partial gastrectomies were traditionally performed for recurrent peptic ulceration. With the advent of H. pylori eradication therapy partial gastrectomies are now rarely performed. However, partial gastrectomies are still performed for peptic ulceration refractory to medical therapy. Typically B12 deficiency is due to the impaired production of intrinsic factor, but it may be associated with iron and folate deficiency. Billroth II more commonly than I. Anaemia after partial gastrectomy occurs in over 70% of untreated patients after three years."
basic medicine,13,Which one of the following is the normal flora found in the particular anatomical site?,Female genital tract: lactobacilli,Nasopharynx: Propionibacteria,Skin: Haemophilus spp,Stomach: sterile,Urinary tract: Escherichia coli,A,"The normal flora found are:  Female genital tract - Flora of the large bowel plus Lactobacilli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococci, diphtheroids. Nasopharynx - Staphylococci, Streptococci (including Pneumococci), Haemophilus spp., anaerobes. Skin - Staphylococci, Streptococci, Propionibacteria.

basic medicine,14,"Of the following, which is correct concerning lidocaine?",Inhibits the conduction of neuronal impulses,Inhibits the generation of neuronal impulses,Is associated with haemolytic anaemia,Is effective for the treatment of both supraventricular and ventricular tachycardia,Is only effective via parenteral administration,A,Lidocaine is associated with the inhibition of the conduction of neuronal impulses rather than inhibiting the generation of impulses. It an effective local anaesthetic agent when used topically in urinary catheterisation for instance. It is associated with methaemoglobinaemia.
basic medicine,15,A 25-year-old male presents after being bitten on the hand by a terrier. The wound appears deep and is associated with swelling. After the wound is cleaned and he has received tetanus immunisation. Which of the following antibiotic regimes would be most appropriate for this patient?,Co-amoxiclav oral,Doxycycline oral,Flucloxacillin oral,Penicillin G IM,Trimethoprim oral,A,"The use of prophylactic antibiotics in dog bites is controversial although evidence supports their use in deep wounds, bites to the hands, and signs of infection. Additionally, immune compromise should be considered as an indication together with involvement of deep structures such as joints or tendons or in the presence of prosthetic joints. Co-amoxiclav is recommended as first-line treatment for all cat or human bites and other complicated animal bites. You should also note that the treatment of animal bites, particularly of the hand, may not be limited to antibiotics alone and you may need to seek the advice of a plastic surgeon about debridement or tendon repair. "
basic medicine,16,"A patient has short forth and fifth metacarpals, short stature, obesity, learning difficulty and a history of muscle spasms, tetany and seizures. What is the likely gene abnormality?",Abnormal PTH,Abnormal Calcitonin,Abnormal G protein on the PTH receptor,Abnormal tyrosine kinase on the PTH receptor,Abnormal serine kinase on the PTH receptor,C,"This patient has pseudohypoparathyroidism which has features of low calcium such as muscle spasms, tetany, seizures and low IQ. It has various subtypes but the most common is known as Albrights hereditary osteodystrophy which has a characteristic set of features which includes obesity, short stature and blunted fourth and fifth metacarpals. The PTH receptor is a G protein linked receptor and abnormalities with this is the cause of pseudohypoparathyroidism."
basic medicine,17,Which is true of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma?,Has a metastatic incidence less than 1 %,Is best treated by skin flap rather than by excision and grafting in a recurrent lesion,Management should be based on the patient's age and anatomical location,Requires a lymph node excision in all cases,Requires an excision margin of 2 cm,C,"A margin of 10 mms is usually recommended for cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). However, if such margins cannot be achieved due to anatomical constraints (such as tumours around the eyes), surgery plus adjuvant treatment such as radiation should be considered. Radiation therapy can be effectively employed in patients over 55 years of age, particularly around the eyelids, nose, and lip. A recurrent lesion is usually treated by complete excision and grafting rather than a skin flap since the adjacent tissue (that is, the flap) could have tumour cells. Elective lymph node dissection is not performed routinely. Five per cent to 10% of SCC metastasise. Lesions on the scalp that arise in areas of previous radiation are particularly prone to metastasis."
basic medicine,18,A 48-year-old woman with chronic pancreatitis due to gallstones is noted to have a macrocytic anaemia. What is the most likely cause of the anaemia?,Bone marrow dysfunction,Folate deficiency,Hyposplenism,Hypothyroidism,Vitamin B12 deficiency,E,"Chronic pancreatitis and the resultant pancreatic insufficiency results in the failure of splitting of dietary B12 from R-binders, a reaction that requires trypsin. This inhibits the binding of intrinsic factor to the vitamin B12 so it is not absorbed. In alcoholic chronic pancreatitis (which accounts for up to 90% of cases of chronic pancreatitis) macrocytosis is also caused by folate deficiency and bone marrow dysfunction."
basic medicine,19,You prescribed antibiotics to a patient who requires intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The antibacterial action of clindamycin is due to which of the following?,Damages bacterial DNA via multiple reactive intermediaries,Dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor,Interfering with the synthesis of proteins,Inhibiting DNA synthesis via enzymatic mediator,Inhibiting biosynthesis of cell wall peptidoglycan,C,Clindamycin Interferes with the synthesis of proteins by binding to ribosome subunits Clindamycin prevents bacterial replication via a bacteriostatic mechanism by interfering with the synthesis of proteins via binding to ribosomes. Clindamycin is a lincosamide antibiotic. The mechanism of action is similar to that of macrolides.Antibiotics

What is the likeliest cause?",Brucella melitensis,Escherichia coli,M. tuberculosis,Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA),Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA),E,"In the United Kingdom, MSSA is a more common cause of severe community-acquired infections than MRSA. Brucella and TB can cause osteomyelitis in patients from countries where these infections are endemic but do not cause a raised white cell count. Escherichia coli is an unlikely cause of vertebral osteomyelitis."
basic medicine,26,The lesser omental sac is bounded by which of the following?,Medially by the transverse mesocolon,Posteriorly by the stomach,Superiorly by the quadrate lobe of the liver,To the left by the lesser omentum,To the right by the epiploic foramen,E,"The lesser sac is also known as the omental bursa as it provides a slippery surface for the posterior wall of the stomach. The lesser omentum and the stomach form the anterior wall of the sac. To the left the sac extends to the hilum of the spleen, where the peritoneum forms the lienorenal and gastrosplenic ligaments. The right edge is formed by the epiploic foramen (the entrance to the lesser sac from the peritoneal cavity). The sloping roof of the sac is the peritoneum covering the caudate lobe of the liver. The inferior border is formed by the posterior transverse mesocolon."

basic medicine,30,A 17‐year‐old girl presents to you six weeks pregnant. After discussion with her family and yourself she has decided that she would like a termination. She is terrified of having an operation and requests a medical termination. You explain the process and give her mifepristone. What is the action of this drug?,Inhibits the action of oestrogen,Inhibits the action of progesterone,Imitates GnRH,Imitates oxytocin,Inhibits HCG,B,"Mifepristone inhibits the action of progesterone by binding to and blocking progesterone receptors. It can be used as a medical alternative to surgical termination up to seven weeks after conception. It is given as a single dose orally, and is followed 48 hours later by a prostaglandin pessary (gemeprost) to induce uterine contractions and soften the cervix. Progesterone is secreted by the corpus luteum in early pregnancy, acting to inhibit uterine motility and maintain the endometrium after implantation. By blocking the action of progesterone, the endometrium begins to degenerate, menstruation occurs and the embryo sloughs off with the uterine lining"
basic medicine,31,The enterohepatic circulation primarily involves which part of the gastrointestinal tract?,Anus,Jejunum,Pancreas,Rectosigmoid junction,Terminal ileum,E,"The enterohepatic circulation is a means of recycling some of the waste materials excreted in the bile. At the level of the terminal ileum, bile salts and some of the bilirubin derivatives are reabsorbed and return to the liver in the portal circulation. This process is regulated by a number of transporter proteins both in the liver canaliculi and in the ileum. Bacterial flora in the colon also facilitate the enterohepatic circulation of bilirubin derivatives. Some bacteria contain the enzyme beta-glucuronidase which converts conjugated bilirubin to unconjugated bilirubin, which is more lipid-soluble and more easily reabsorbed."

The inguinal ligament is the thickened lower border of the aponeurosis of the external oblique. It extends from the anterior superior iliac spine to the pubic tubercle in a curved line which folds posteriorly. Its medial attachment forms a narrow sling for support of the spermatic cord or round ligament of the uterus. The femoral artery lies at the mid-inguinal point, between the vein and the nerve, and above the capsule of the hip joint beneath iliopsoas. The psoas is supplied by segmental branches from the lumbar plexus. Pectineus arises from the superior ramus of the pubis."

basic medicine,40,Mutation in which of the following is associated with Marfan's syndrome?,Collagen type 1 gene,Collagen type 5 gene,Fibrillin-1 gene,FMR-1 gene,Type II procollagen gene,C,"Mutation in the fibrillin-1 gene is thought to be responsible for Marfan's syndrome. In Marfan's syndrome the lack of normal fibrillin-1 leads to overactivity of transforming growth factor type beta (TGF-b) in the wall of the aorta and the heart valves, leading to damage and destruction to the connective tissue which weakens that aortic wall and heart valves causing them to stretch. Type 1 collagen gene defects are found in osteogenesis imperfecta. Both type 1 and type 3 collagen defects can be seen in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Type II procollagen defect is found in hereditary spodyloarthropathy. "
basic medicine,41,"In the presence of inflammation, which is decreased?",Caeruloplasmin,Complement proteins,Fibrinogen,Platelets,Sweating,E,"Inflammation induces high systemic levels of acute-phase proteins. These proteins include C-reactive protein and vasopressin, which cause a range of systemic effects including;  Fever Increased blood pressure Decreased sweating, and Loss of appetite.  Thrombocythaemia occurs with chronic inflammation, for example, in rheumatoid arthritis. Ferritin is an acute-phase reactant and serum levels rise in inflammation. Caeruloplasmin is a copper carrying protein that is also an acute phase reactant. Fibrinogen is a clotting factor and synthesis is increased by the liver in inflammation along with other acute phase proteins. Complement proteins such as C3a and C5a have multiple roles in inflammation (chemotaxis, bacterial pore lysis) and serum levels rise accordingly."

Which of the following medications is most likely to be responsible?",Aspirin,Atorvastatin,Omeprazole,Paracetamol,Sodium valproate,A,"Urticaria is one of the most common dermatologic problems seen by primary care physicians and often a source of frustration for patient and physician alike. Pinpointing the cause may be challenging--or impossible--because of the many and varied triggers. Patients with aspirin sensitivity can present with either mucosal reactions (the aspirin triad of nasal polyposis, sinusitis, and asthma) or cutaneous reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis). "
basic medicine,45,What is the mechanism by which patients with testicular cancer develop gynaecomastia?,Altered fat metabolism,Metastatic disease to breast tissue,Paraneoplastic phenomenon,Raised oestrogen levels,Raised testosterone levels,D,High levels of β-HCG in patients with testicular cancers cause increased production of oestrogen which in turn stimulates hypertrophy of breast tissue. This usually resolves with treatment of the underlying cancer. Rarely gynaecomastia can be the trigger by which a young man will seek medical attention; testicular examination should therefore be done in every new case as well as testing of β-HCG and consideration for ultrasound scan of the testes.
basic medicine,46,Which of the following is correct concerning the umbilical artery?,Is a branch of the external iliac artery,Is normally a single structure,Passes through the liver,Returns deoxygenated blood to the placenta in utero,When catheterised may result in leg ischaemia,D,"The umbilical artery is a bilateral structure and is a branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery. It ascends out of the pelvis along the anterior abdominal wall and joins the umbilicus. In utero, the umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood from the fetus to the placenta. The inferior gluteal artery is another branch of the anterior division of the internal iliac artery and it supplies blood to the skin over the buttocks. Umbilical artery cannulation may interfere with this supply and lead to ischaemia of this area."

basic medicine,48,"A 30 year old women has had a positive serum pregnancy test, no gestational sac shown in US report. She is unsure of her LMP. You perform a progesterone test. The result is 57 nmol/l. According to NICE guidelines what level is consistent with viable pregnancy?",>60 nmol/l,>35 nmol/l,<22 nmol/l,>5 nmol/l,None of the above,E,"SUBJECT: Diagnosis of abortionHighlights:NICE state progesterone levels shouldn't be used to diagnose viable or ectopic pregnancy. A single progesterone measurement for women in early pregnancy presenting with bleeding or pain and inconclusive ultrasound assessments can rule out a viable pregnancy. regarding managing pregnancy of unknown location hCG measurement is used to aid clinical signs and NICE has guidance on when to take hCG measurements and how to interpret them,it is important to go on clinical symptoms first. RCOG suggest levels >60 are consistent with viable pregnancy and you may get a progesterone level in a clinical scenario but not usually without serial hCG measurements.so progesterone level is not used to confirm viable pregnancy. RCOG advise progesterone levelsstrongly suggestive non-viable pregnancy and levels >60nmol/l suggestive intrauterine pregnancy NICE advise DO NOT use serum progesterone measurements as an adjunct to diagnose either viable intrauterine pregnancy or ectopic pregnancy Regardingpregnancy of unknown location :clinical picture is DONE FIRST THEN B-hCG measurements.Guidelines: NICE & RCOG : "
basic medicine,49,Which of the following can give a biochemical picture indistinguishable from extra‐hepatic obstructive jaundice?,Halothane,Vancomycin,Lidocaine,Erythromycin estolate,Isoniazid,D,Extra‐hepatic jaundice would suggest a raised bilirubin with raised alkaline phosphatase and gamma‐glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT).Halothane and isoniazid may give rise to a hepatitic picture raised aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) predominantly.

basic medicine,51,Which of the following is true concerning the wrist and hand?,Lymph from the thumb drains to the epitrochlear nodes,Rupture of the tendon of flexor digitorum profundus results in an inability to flex the distal interphalangeal joint,Tenderness in anatomical snuff box would signify a fractured lunate,The capitate may have begun to ossify at birth,Wasting of both thenar and hypothenar eminences would signify a median nerve lesion,B,"The lymphatic drainage of the thumb and index finger (indeed the lateral part of the hand) follow the cephalic vein and drain into the infraclavicular group of nodes. The tendon of flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) inserts into the base of the distal phalanx (the tendon of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS) splits around FDP, and inserts into the base of the middle phalanx), contraction of which, causes flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint. Tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox is classically a sign of a fractured scaphoid. The capitate is the first carpal bone to ossify in the first year of life (strictly speaking the carpus is cartilaginous at birth). The remainder of the carpal bones ossify at various intervals up until the age of 12 years, when all bones are ossified. A median nerve lesion would result in wasting of the thenar eminence, but not of the hypothenar eminence ."
basic medicine,52,Which of the following is true of the rectum?,Commences at the level of the L5 vertebrae,Drains lymph to the inguinal nodes,Has a mesentery in its proximal third,Has a parasympathetic nerve supply derived from S3,Is about 30 cm in length,D,"The rectum extends from the level of the third sacral vertebral body to the anorectal line. The third sacral corresponds to the termination of a definite mesentery. It marks the point at which there is a change in the blood supply and the level at which the tinea of the sigmoid spread out to reinforce the longitudinal muscle coat. It corresponds to the site of the rectal narrowing to join the sigmoid. It marks the change in colour, the capillary pattern and the rugosity of the rectal mucosa. The rectum varies from 10-15 cm in length, while the circumference varies from 15 cm at the rectosigmoid junction, to 25 cm or more at its widest ampullary portion. Its parasympathetic supply is derived from the hypogastric plexus of S234 origin."
basic medicine,53,A 75-year-old man with squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is thought to have resectable disease. Which of the following would be a contraindication to surgery?,Clubbing,Forced expiratory volume (FEV)1 of 0.75 L,His age of 75 years,Pleural effusion,Syndrome of Inappropriate ADH,B,"Assessing fitness for surgery in cases of lung carcinoma can be difficult, and requires consideration of a number of factors. Lung function needs to be assessed prior to referral to the thoracic surgical team. A post-bronchodilator FEV1 of greater than1.5 litres is sufficient if a lobectomy is all that is required. If the tumour necessitates a pneumonectomy, the post-bronchodilator FEV should be more than 2 litres. Below these values, further investigation in the form of estimation of transfer factor, oxygen saturations at rest and quantitative isotope perfusion should be undertaken. These values can be used to calculate estimated postoperative FEV1 and postoperative transfer factor. Patients with an estimated postoperative FEV1 less than 40% predicted, transfer factor more than 40% predicted and oxygen saturations of more than 90% on air are considered to be average risk. Those with an FEV1 and transfer factor of less than 40% are thought to be high risk. All other combinations are indications for exercise testing (shuttle walk tests or formal cardiopulmonary exercise tests). High-risk patients identified by this step-wise testing should be discussed at a formal multidisciplinary meeting, and should be considered for more limited resection or non-surgical management. Perioperative morbidity increases with advancing age, and more elderly patients typically require more intensive perioperative support. However, surgery for clinically stage I and II disease can be as effective in patients over the age of 70 and should be considered regardless of age. Age over 80 alone is not a contraindication to lobectomy or wedge resection for stage I disease, but may be a contraindication to pneumonectomy and each case should be assessed individually. Cardiovascular fitness should be assessed with a preoperative ECG. Those with an audible murmur should have an echocardiogram. A recent MI (within 6 months) is an indication for cardiology opinion prior to surgery. All patients with a history of previous stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, or carotid bruits should be assessed with carotid Doppler studies. Those with significant stenosis should be assessed by a vascular surgeon or stroke physician. Patients presenting with preoperative weight loss of more than 10% and/or performance status of WHO 2 or worse should have their BMI and albumin measured, and metastatic disease carefully excluded. Patients who are anatomically suited to resection but have more than one adverse medical factor should have their management discussed formally at a multidisciplinary meeting. In addition to the above patient factors, there are characteristics of the tumour which will help determine operability. All patients being considered for surgery should have a plain chest radiograph and CT scan of the thorax, liver and adrenal glands. Confirmatory percutaneous biopsy in patients presenting with peripheral lesions is not mandatory, particularly if the lesion was not present on previous chest radiographs. Patients with mediastinal nodes greater than 1cm in diameter on CT should undergo biopsy. Patients with stage I (cT1N0 and cT2N0) and stage II (cT1N1, cT2N1 and cT3N0) tumours should be considered operable. Patients with stage IIIA (cT3N1 and cT1-3N2) tumours have a low change of being cured by surgery alone, but it can be used in the context of a trial in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy. Stage IIIB and IV tumours should generally be considered inoperable. Whilst most pleural effusions associated with lung carcinoma are due to the tumour (and results in classification as a T4 tumour), in some patients cytological examination of the fluid is negative. If this is confirmed on more than one occasion, and clinical judgement dictates that the effusion is not related to the tumour, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element. This may mean they are suitable for surgery, and therefore it is not the correct answer here. Paraneoplastic conditions, such as clubbing and syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) are not linked to the stage of disease and are therefore not automatic contraindications to surgery. "
basic medicine,54,"A 78-year-old male presents with an hour history of an acutely cold, painful, left lower limb. On examination he has a radial pulse of 98 beats per minute irregular and there are no pulses palpable in the left lower limb. The skin is pale but not mottled. The patient is able to move his left toes, ankle and knee. Which of the following would be the most appropriate management for this patient?",Aspirin,Aspirin and clopidogrel,Embolectomy,Heparinisation,Thrombolysis,C,"This man has developed an acutely ischaemic limb due to an embolus lodging in the origin of the femoral artery. The embolus is most likely to have originated from the left atrium as he is in atrial fibrillation. Acute limb ischaemia results from a complete occlusion of a proximal artery in the absence of collaterals resulting in the classic presentation of:  pain paralysis paraesthesia pallor pulselessness and, a perishingly cold limb.  Initial management is emergency balloon catheter embolectomy under local or general anaesthetic. Limb salvage is reported to be 70% with a 22% mortality. Intra-arterial thrombolysis is usually reserved for patients who have thrombosed a diseased segment of artery or have occluded a lower limb bypass graft (venous or synthetic). Following embolectomy the patient is usually started on a DOAC if they remain in atrial fibrillation to prevent recurrence."
basic medicine,55,The urogenital diaphragm is pierced by which of the following?,Vagina,Ureters,Rectum,Obturator nerve,Vas deferens,A,The urogenital diaphragm lies inferior to the urogenital hiatus of the levator ani muscle and supports this potentially weak region of the pelvic floor.It is pierced by the urethra and vagina.
basic medicine,56,A 22-year-old male is admitted after drinking engine coolant in an apparent suicide attempt after finding his wife in bed with the postman. Investigations reveal:    pH 7.1 (7.36-7.44)   pO2 15.3 kPa (11.3-12.6)   pCO2 3.2 kPa (4.7-6.0)   Standard bicarbonate 2.2 mmol/L (20-28)   Serum calcium 1.82 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)    After replacing calcium which of the following is the most urgent treatment for this man?,8.4% bicarbonate infusion,Alcohol infusion,Fomepizole infusion,Gastric lavage,Haemodialysis,A,"Engine coolant contains ethylene glycol. Ingestion of as little as 30-60 ml is capable of causing death. Traditional management of poisoning includes the use of ethanol, with or without haemodialysis. Activated charcoal is not indicated and gastric lavage may be beneficial only in the first hour after ingestion. However fomepizole has recently been approved for use and is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase. However it is very expensive and the evidence supporting its use over alcohol is lacking. Also, this patient already has a severe metabolic acidosis. In these circumstances, antidotal therapy to block alcohol dehydrogenase with ethanol or 4-MP alone is insufficient to treat the poisoning. Data suggest that a severe lactic acidosis needs initial correction and in this patient the most appropriate treatment would be IV fluids with bicarbonate to correct the metabolic acidosis. Then haemodialysis is probably required."
basic medicine,57,A 77-year-old woman is admitted as an emergency with dehydration following an episode of gastroenteritis. Past medical history includes an ileostomy for Crohn's disease 30 years previously and hypertension. She is noted to be hypokalaemic at 2.9 mmol/L (3.5-5.5). Which of the following is a reasonable explanation for her potassium level?,Blood transfusion,Chronic renal failure,Use of amiloride,Use of furosemide,Use of spironolactone,D,"Furosemide is a loop diuretic and would lead to hypokalaemia. The other options are all common causes of hyperkalaemia. Many patients are inadequately resuscitated both as emergency admissions and post-operatively and it is important to identify and treat causes of salt loss, for example, anti-emetics/anti-diarrhoeal agents as well as correcting the potassium imbalance."
basic medicine,58,Which of the following is true regarding chromosomes?,A fetus with triploidy will have 47 chromosomes,Down's syndrome is most commonly due to an extra copy of chromosome 21 inherited from the father,Heterochromatin is mostly composed of active genes,Telomeres provide the point of attachment to the mitotic spindle,The normal human karyotype contains 22 pairs of autosomes,E,The human karyotype consists of 22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes. Down's syndrome is most commonly due to trisomy of C21 with the majority a consequence of non-dysjunction within the ovum. Trisomy results in 47 chromosomes whereas triploidy is the presence of three complete sets of chromosomes instead of two in all cells. Heterochromatin is of little genetic significance containing mostly inactivated genes. Telomeres are the distal extremities of the chromosomal arms but the centromeres provide the point of attachment to the mitotic spindle.
basic medicine,59,"During an upper GI endoscopy, as the tip of the endoscope descends through the thorax, which of the following structures are on the left hand side of the oesophagus?",Azygous vein,Left bronchus,Thoracic duct,Thoracic vertebra,Trachea,C,"The left side of the oesophagus is related to the thoracic duct, the pleura, the aortic arch, the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and the left subclavian artery. The left bronchus crosses the oesophagus and is thus an anterior relation, as well as the trachea, pericardium and diaphragm. The azygous vein and pleura are the right sided relations. The thoracic vertebrae are the posterior relations of the diaphragm."

On microscopy there are Gram-positive cocci, arranged in grape-like clusters and white, raised, cohesive colonies are formed. It is distinguished from S. aureus, also found on skin, which has large, round, golden-yellow colonies. S. epidermidis is usually insensitive to antibiotics, including penicillin, amoxicillin, and methicillin. Although it is often a contaminant in blood cultures it is associated with line infections. Central venous catheters are an especially likely site of infection even in the absence of overt exit site sepsis. They should not be ignored but interpreted in the clinical context, and usually the blood cultures should be repeated. In patients with central lines, blood cultures should be taken both peripherally and from the central line as semi-quantitative microbiological techniques are available that may point to the central line as the principal site of infection."

The most likely diagnosis here is cauda equina compression, which has presented with significant neurological deficit. Given the history, the most likely case is metastatic cord compression, possibly from a lung carcinoma. Metastatic spinal cord compression is a medical emergency. . Corticosteroids should be started immediately, even before the diagnosis is confirmed radiologically, and this is usually with dexamethasone 16mg STAT followed by 8mg BD (either oral or IV is acceptable). This should at least temporarily reduce oedema related to the underlying tumour and thus have a positive impact on neurological deficit, and the response to steroids predicts neurological response to subsequent definitive treatment which should be started within 24 hours. Surgery is the optimal definitive treatment in patients who are fit enough, and have a good enough prognosis, with radiotherapy given to the majority of those unsuitable for surgery. Chemotherapy can be given if the causative malignancy is known to be extremely chemo-sensitive, for example lymphoma or sometimes small cell lung carcinoma. Fine needle aspiration or core biopsy is ususally only needed if the underlying oncological diagnosis is unknown, and there is no other accessible lesion. If the patient is undergoing surgery, it might be possible to send histology at the time of operation but this depends on the approach taken and this should be clarified with the surgical team. If lymphoma is strongly suspected, a biopsy should ideally be attempted prior to starting corticosteroids and therefore you must immediately liaise with the Interventional Radiology team to get this done as a matter of priority."
basic medicine,81,Which of the following anatomical considerations is correct?,Midline cerebellar lesions cause marked horizontal nystagmus,In cortical blindness pupillary reactions are abnormal,Optic chiasm lesions characteristically produce a bitemporal hemianopia,Optic tract lesions produce an ipsilateral homonymous hemianopia,The physiological blind spot is unaffected by papilloedema,C,"The physiological blind spot is enlarged in papilloedema as Peripapillary photoreceptors are displaced. In cortical blindness, pupillary reflexes, eye movements and fundoscopy are all normal. Optic tract lesions produce an contralateral homonymous hemianopia. Horizontal nystagmus occurs in unilateral disease of the cerebral hemisphere, with the fast phase directed to the side of the lesion. Lateral cerebellar lesions classically cause pronounced nystagmus, whereas this is rarer and much more subtle with midline lesions."
basic medicine,82,Which one of the following is correct concerning the urinary bladder?,Has a venous plexus draining to the external iliac veins,Is attached to the umbilicus by the right and left lateral umbilical ligaments,Is related superomedially to the levator ani muscle,Has an epithelium derived from endoderm,Is separated from the symphysis pubis by a fold of peritoneum,D,"The bladder is derived from two sources, the cloaca and mesonephric ducts. The primitive cloaca is divided by the urorectal septum into the urogenital sinus and rectum.The bladder largely develops from the vesicle part of the urogenital sinus.The mesonephric ducts are drawn into the floor of the bladder as it expands, to form the trigone.The epithelium is derived from the endoderm of the urogenital sinus, whereas the ureter and pelvis epithelium are derived from mesoderm. Venous drainage is to the internal iliac veins.The vertex is directed forward towards the upper part of the symphysis pubis (fascial separation), and from it the median (middle) umbilical ligament (remnant of the urachus) continues upward on the back of the anterior abdominal wall to the umbilicus.The medial umbilical ligaments are the remnants of the umbilical arteries.The peritoneum is carried by it from the vertex of the bladder on to the abdominal wall to form the middle umbilical fold."
basic medicine,83,Which of the following is a gram positive obligate anaerobe?,Bacteroides,Streptococcus,Staphlococcus,Clostridia,Prevotella,D,Almost all clinically relevant gram positive bacteria are facultative i.e. they can thrive in environments with or without Oxygen. If you are asked about a gram positive obligate anaerobe the answer should be Clostridia. Conversely if you are asked about a gram-negative obligate anaerobe the answer should be Bacteroides (recently renamed Prevotella).NoteSome texts may quote Actinomyces as obligate anaerobes but in reality they are facultatively anaerobic with the exception of Actinomyces meyeri (obligate anaerobe).

basic medicine,93,"A 21-year-old woman, originally from West Africa, is admitted with a suspected diagnosis of acute appendicitis. She informs you that she has sickle cell disease. Which statement is correct?",A full blood count will confirm her haemoglobinopathy,A morphine infusion (PCA) should not be prescribed post-operatively,Exchange blood transfusion is needed to achieve an HbS concentration of 30-40%,Her abdominal pain could be due to a sickle cell crisis,Post-operatively intravenous fluids should be restricted,D,"The initial management of the patient with abdominal pain, whether it is due to appendicitis or a sickle crisis, is to provide oxygen, intravenous opioid analgesia and fluids. Sickle cell anaemia is a haemoglobinopathy caused by substitution of valine for glutamic acid at position 6 (from the N-terminal) of the beta chain. Homozygotes contain only abnormal haemoglobin (HbSS) which depolymerises at a PO2 of 5-6 kPa, which is found in normal venous blood. Thus, sickle cell disease (HbSS) patients are continuously sickling. Heterozygotes contain both normal and abnormal haemoglobins (HbAS) and are said to have sickle cell trait. These patients only sickle at extremely low PO2 values of 2.5-4 kPa. Sickle cell crises are caused by acute vascular occlusion, which is associated with severe pain, which can mimic an acute abdomen. In addition to hypoxaemia, sickling can be precipitated by:  hypothermia dehydration infection exertion, and stress.  Thus the peri-operative management of sickle cell disease patients involves keeping them well oxygenated, warm, well hydrated, providing adequate analgesia by PCA (patient controlled analgesia) and avoiding acidosis (venous stasis). Exchange blood transfusions may be required by HbSS patients before major elective surgery, the aim being to lower the HbS concentration to 30-40%, which would be impossible to organise before emergency surgery. Haemoglobin electrophoresis is the only investigation which can determine the nature of the haemoglobinopathy, but is rarely performed out of hours. A Sickledex test will detect HbS but provides no information on other haemoglobins. An FBC will usually show a low haemoglobin in sickle cell disease, but it can be normal in sickle cell trait and a blood film will show sickle cells."

In the late third trimester, cervicalripening begins. This is followed by cervical effacement and dilatation which occur during labour.Cervical ripening∙ Softening of the cervix that usually begins before the onset of labour and is a prerequisite for cervicaldilation∙ Caused by biochemical changes with rearrangement and realignment of the collagen molecules andreduced bridging of collagen fibres. The activity of proteolytic enzymes contribute to these changes∙ There is an increase in hyaluronic acid and water content while the amount of dermatan sulphate andchondroitin sulphate decreasesCervical effacement∙ This is shortening and thinning of the cervix in response to uterine contractions∙ In primigravidae, cervical effacement occurs before dilatation. In multiparous women, dilatation andeffacement may occur simultaneouslyCervical dilatation∙ This occurs passively under the influence of uterine contractions and pressure from the presenting part.The cervix is stretched and pulled over the presenting part.

basic medicine,99,A prolonged thrombin clotting time may occur in which of the following?,Disseminated intravascular coagulation,Presence of factor V Leiden,Prothrombin deficiency,Renal disease,Warfarin therapy,A,"Thrombin time compares a patient's rate of clot formation to that of a sample of normal pooled plasma. Thrombin is added to the samples of plasma. If the plasma does not clot immediately, a fibrinogen deficiency is present. Reptilase, a substance derived from snake venom, is used instead of thrombin if a patient is receiving heparin. Reptilase has a similar action to thrombin, but unlike thrombin it is not inhibited by heparin. Thrombin is added to platelet-poor plasma at 37°C; the clotting time is recorded. Typically 14-16 seconds is the normal time. Thrombin time is prolonged in:  Afibrinogenaemia Hypofibrinogenaemia, and Dysfibrinogenaemia.  Thombin time is prolonged by:  Heparin (corrects with protamine) Fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), and Paraproteins (partial correction with protamine).

basic medicine,101,Upregulation of which of the following proteins is associated with multi-drug chemotherapy resistance?,BCL-2,CYP2D6,Cytochrome P450,Tp53,P-glycoprotein,E,"P-glycoprotein, which is also known as multidrug resistance protein 1, is a member of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporters which actively remove harmful substances from the cytoplasm. If upregulated these proteins can pump chemotherapeutic agents out of tumour cells leading to drug resistance. BCL-2 is an apoptosis inhibitor and when upregulated leads to the development of B cell lymphomas such as Follicular lymphoma. TP53 is also another regulator of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. When mutated or deleted it can lead to the development of many malignancies."
basic medicine,102,A 24-year-old female who has previously suffered with severe depression presents with secondary amenorrhoea. She is found to have a prolactin of 645 mU/L (normal 50-350). Which of the drugs which she takes may cause this?,Becotide,Montelukast,Omeprazole,Risperidone,Sertraline,D,"Antipsychotic medications, in particular the typical antipsychotics and risperidone, are known to elevate prolactin levels. This is due to their ability to block dopamine D2 receptors. By doing so they block dopamine's action on the pitutary. This reduces inhibition of prolactin secretion, thereby causing hyperprolactinaemia. Symptoms of this include:  amenorrhoea galactorrhoea infertility loss of libido, and erectile dysfunction.  Sertraline is not thought to exert dopamine antagonist effects and thus does not commonly result in hyperprolactinaemia, but some cases have been reported in the literature. The other medications on her list have not been commonly associated with hyperprolactinaemia."

basic medicine,104,"A dexamethasone test shows that a patients cortisol levels fail to change with a low dose, but fall with a high dose of dexamethasone. ACTH levels are high after a low dose but fall with a high dose of dexamethasone although they are still above the normal range. What is the diagnosis?",Ectopic ACTH producing tumour,Adrenal tumour,Cushings disease,Pseudo Cushings syndrome,Hypothyroidism,C,"The dexamethasone suppression test is used to determine the cause of Cushings syndrome. A base level for cortisol and ACTH is first measured then 1mg of dexamethasone is given. A normal patient will have their cortisol levels suppressed by this. A high dose of 8mg is then given. If the ACTH level is low and cortisol is unaffected by this high dose, it is likely adrenal Cushings syndrome in which an adrenal tumour is producing cortisol and this is providing negative feedback to suppress ACTH. If the ACTH level is normal or slightly elevated and cortisol is unaffected by high dexamethasone then it is likely to be ectopic ACTH syndrome in which a cancer is producing ectopic ACTH. If the ACTH level is above normal, even after the high level of dexamethasone, and cortisol has been suppressed by the high dose of dexamethasone then Cushings disease is likely."

basic medicine,106,Which of the following is true regarding ultrasound scans?,Are safe in all patients,Fluid appears white,Give better diagnostic images in obese patients,Give good visualisation of the retroperitoneum,Is operator independent,A,"Ultrasound waves from the probe are transmitted through the tissues and are either reflected back, deflected or absorbed at the interfaces between tissue planes. The reflected sound waves make up the image you see. Ultrasound scans are useful to image soft tissues. High density tissues (for example, bone) reflect a large amount of the waves and appear white, low density tissue (for example, cyst fluid) appear black. Bowel gas can prevent adequate examination of the abdomen and the retroperitoneum is often poorly visualised. In obese patients a large proportion of the sound waves are absorbed and thus scans can be difficult and of low quality in these patients. Ultrasound is also highly operator dependant. It is, however safe to use in any patient, gives dynamic, real time images, and is relatively cheap and mobile."

Which of the following treatments is most useful?,Metoclopramide,Ondansetron,Cyclizine,Levomepromazine,Dexamthasone,A,The history and clinical findings are indicative of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to her pancreatic carcinoma. Metoclopramide is a prokinetic and improves gastric motility thus is the most useful antiemetic to be utilised as symptoms are due to poor gastric emptying.
basic medicine,121,What frequency would typically be used for monopolar diathermy?,5 Hz,50 KHz,100 KHz,500 KHz,"10,000 KHz",D,The frequency must be greater than 100 KHz. 500 KHz is typically used. Below this depolarisation (electric shock) can occur. Household frequency is around 60 KHz. Diathermy Diathermy BasicsIn surgical diathermy (or electrosurgery) AC current is passed through a conductor with some energy appearing as heat. There are 2 types of DiathermyMonopolar Current passed from small electrode held by surgeon and returned to a large area plate via patients tissues. The concentrated current at the electrode tip produces a lot of heat whereas the current is dissipated over a large area at the plate.It is important the plate is properly attached as if the plate area is reduced the current concentrates and can cause tissue burnsBipolar Current passes between two electrodes held by surgeon as forceps.Diathermy can be used for cutting or coagulating. Bipolar is used to coagulate not cut. In cutting (monopoly) the waveform can be varied. A continuous single frequency sine wave is often used. Pulsed waves can reduce local thermal tissue damage. To prevent cell deploarisation (especially in cardiac tissue) the frequency must be over 100 kHz. Below this electric shock or even electrocution could occur. In surgical practice frequencies of around 500KHz are used.

basic medicine,125,Which of the following is true of autosomal dominant breast cancer?,BRCA2 mutation is associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer,It accounts for nearly half of all breast cancer cases in the United States,It can be detected by hybridisation with a single oligonucleotide probe,"Penetrance is close to 100%, with nearly all gene carriers developing breast cancer by age 80",Autosomal dominant breast cancer affects females but not males,A,"An estimated 5-10% of breast cancers are inherited. Autosomal dominant inheritance is the main means of inheritance and the BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are two such genes. BRCA1 is also associated with increased risk of pancreatic cancer, and BRCA2 is associated with pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, and melanoma. It is important to remember that inheritance of these mutations leads to an increased risk of developing a malignancy, not the certainty of developing a malignancy."
basic medicine,126,Which of the following is true regarding heparin?,Enhances antithrombin III activity,Has no effect on platelet aggregation,Induces thrombocytopaenia in 20% of patients,Is a strongly acidic protein,Readily crosses the placenta,A,"Heparin is a strongly acidic mucopolysaccharide (not a protein), and as the name heparin implies, it is derived from the liver. Heparin has many actions, but principally it enhances antithrombin III activity, which in turn inhibits activated factors IX, X, XI, XII and thrombin. Heparin also activates the enzyme lipoprotein lipase in plasma, lowering the plasma triglycerides and inhibiting platelet aggregation by fibrin. A side effect in up to 5% of patients (not 20%) is heparin induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT). As heparin is so strongly acidic, it binds avidly to proteins, and does not readily cross the placenta and other membranes. Pregnant women requiring anticoagulation with warfarin, are converted to heparin, as this has a much lower risk of teratogenicity."

basic medicine,132,Mutation in codon 12 of the Ras oncogene often results in which of the following?,Decreased GTP binding,Decreased GTP hydrolysis,Increased GTP binding,Increased GTP hydrolysis,Increased interaction with SOS,B,The Ras family of oncogenes are important intracellular signalling proteins which transmit signals from receptor tyrosine kinase proteins in the cell membrane down to the nucleus. Ras is controlled by the activity of a GTPase binding site; when guanosine triphosphate (GTP) is bound Ras is active and it slowly hydrolyses the GTP to guanosine diphosphate (GDP) resulting in an inactive state. Mutations in codon 12 result in decreased GTPase activity and a Ras protein which is 'always on' resulting in increased proliferation of the cell.
basic medicine,133,Which of the following is true regarding the infratemporal fossa?,Floor attaches the lateral pterygoid muscle,Medial wall is formed by the ramus of the mandible,Roof is formed by the lesser wing of the sphenoid bone,Transmits the inferior alveolar nerve superiorly within the fossa,Transmits the maxillary artery superficially within the fossa,E,"Infratemporal fossa is the space lying beneath the base of the skull between the side wall of the pharynx and the ramus of the mandible. The roof of the infratemporal fossa is formed by the infratemporal surface of the greater wing of the sphenoid, its medial wall is formed by the lateral pterygoid plate of the sphenoid bone and its lateral wall is formed by the ramus of the mandible. The posterior wall shows the presence of styloid process of the temporal bone. The infratemporal fossa has no anatomical floor. The lateral pterygoid muscle lies in the roof of the fossa and runs horizontally from the region of the pterygoid plate to the mandibular condyle. Branches of the mandibular nerve lie deep to the fossa while the maxillary artery is superficial. The buccal branch of the mandibular nerve passes between the two heads of the lateral pterygoid. The medial pterygoid, lingual and the inferior alveolar nerves emerge below its inferior border and the deep temporal nerves and vessels emerge from its upper border.

basic medicine,136,Homologous blood transfusions are associated with which of the following?,Hypercalcaemia,Hypokalaemia,Mast cell degranulation,Metabolic alkalosis,Raising of the core body temperature,C,"An homologous blood transfusion is the administration of blood to a patient that has been obtained from donors. It usually consists of concentrated or packed erythrocytes suspended in a storage solution such as SAG-M (saline, adenine, glucose and mannitol), which has been stored between 2-6°C. Transfusions of homologous stored blood will in general terms render the patient cold, acidotic (metabolic acidosis) and hyperkalaemic. This is because stored blood has a low pH 6.7-7.0, a high lactic acid content and an increased potassium concentration (up to 30 mmol/L). The blood should be given via a fluid warming device to avoid adverse cooling of the patient and hypothermia. Whole blood obtained from screened donors is collected into bags containing citrate, phosphate and dextrose (CPD) which acts as an anti-coagulant. During rapid or large transfusions the citrate may cause hypocalcaemia, which can be treated by giving intravenous calcium. Alkalosis may follow citrate metabolism to bicarbonate, but this is unlikely to be of clinical significance. Blood products can potentially trigger an anaphylactic reaction following IgE mediated mast cell degranulation, releasing histamine and other vasoactive compounds."

basic medicine,138,Potassium and Phosphate reabsorbed mainly in the kidney specifically in?,Collecting Duct,Descending Loop of Henle,Ascending Loop of Henle,PCT,DCT,D,"A large amount of reabsorption occurs in the proximal convoluted tubule. Reabsorption is when water and solutes within the PCT are transported into the bloodstream. In the PCT this process occurs via bulk transport. The solutes and water move from the PCT to the interstitium and then into peritubular capillaries. The reabsorption in the proximal tubule is isosmotic. it is the main reabsorption site for almost all ions. The PCT reabsorbs :Amino Acids 100% - Glucose 100% - 85-90% of bicarbonate - Phosphate 85% - Carboxylate 100% - Sodium 65% - Potassium 65%-Urea 50% -Calcium, Magnesium and Water variable reabsorption throughout nephron"
basic medicine,139,A 75-year-old man presents with a long history of shortness of breath and ankle oedema. His serum biochemistry shows sodium 122 mmol/L (137-144) and potassium of 2.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9). He now complains of weakness. Which of the following is likely to explain the above biochemical picture?,Addison's disease,Diuretic therapy,Nephrotic syndrome,Primary hyperaldosteronism,SIADH,B,"The long history of his symptoms and serum biochemistry suggests that his condition is due to treatment with furosemide for congestive cardiac failure (CCF). Primary hyperaldosteronism is associated with high aldosterone, suppressed renin, low potassium and normal/high sodium. Clinically it causes hypertension and is often asymptomatic. Addison's disease - glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiency - is classically associated with low sodium and high potassium. Nephrotic syndrome is not associated with hyponatraemia and hypokalaemia in early stages although if there is reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) hyperkalaemia can result. Glomerular disease allows the release of proteins into the urine but electrolytes are reabsorbed. SIADH would not explain the hypokalaemia."

basic medicine,141,Which of the following is correct regarding childhood malignancies?,A bone marrow biopsy should never be performed to exclude leukaemia before ITP is treated with steroids,A mediastinal mass is an infrequent finding in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia,Children on chemotherapy are at low risk if exposed to measles or chickenpox,Cranial irradiation before the age of 3 years has a low neurocognitive morbidity,"The siblings of children on active treatment for cancer can be safely immunised with the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR)",E,"A mediastinal mass is typical of T cell acute leukaemia and can also be a manifestation of T cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Side effects of chemotherapy are extremely common and important. They include:  Infection from immunosuppression Bone marrow suppression, and Gut mucosal damage.  Neutropenia places children at risk of septicaemia and there are specific problems with Gram negative organisms, coagulase negative Staph., Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and disseminated fungal infections. Most viral infections are no worse than in other children, but measles and varicella may be life threatening. Zoster immunoglobulin may be helpful in non-immune children who have been in contact with measles or varicella. Aciclovir is used to treat established varicella infection but no active treatment is available for measles. The use of live vaccines in patients receiving chemotherapy should be avoided until at least six months to a year have elapsed following the completion of chemotherapy. Anaemia requires transfusion, and thrombocytopenia may result in bleeding. Gut mucosal damage may increase the risk of Gram negative infection and is associated with painful mouth ulcers, which can prevent eating. Specific side effects:  Cardiotoxicity with doxorubicin Renal failure and deafness with cisplatin Haemorrhagic cystitis with cyclophosphamide, and Neuropathy with vincristine.  Occasionally leukaemia may present with thrombocytopenia alone. In patients presenting with a low platelet count who are thought to have idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), a bone marrow should be done if steroids are considered as they may suppress the leukaemia enough to delay diagnosis."

basic medicine,161,What is the typical magnetic field strength of an MRI scanner used routinely in UK hospitals?,0.1 - 0.5 T,0.2 -1.0 T,1.5 - 3.0 T,3.0 - 15.0 T,9.4 - 15.0 T,C,"The majority of MRI scanners in UK hospitals are 1.5 to 3.0T. Cardiff installed an ultra high filed 7T scanner in 2015 that is the most powerful MRI scanner in Wales. Glasgow and Oxford also house 7.0T scanners in specialist centres though these ultra high field scanners are generally not used for routine clinical use. More powerful scanners are in development. MRI MRI Key PointsNon-ionising form of radiation Use strong magnetic fields that cause protons to align with the magnetic field Radiofrequency pulses then causes the protons to excite or 'spin', when they relax back into alignment of the field they release radio waves which are detected by the MRI sensors Computers use the radio wave emissions to construct an image Images are often described as T1 or T2 weighted T1 weighted fluid appears dark T2 weighted fluid appears bright MRI magnets typically generate fields of 0.5 to 3.0 Tesla Tesla (T) is the SI unit for magnetic field Weber (Wb) is the SI unit for magnetic flux"
basic medicine,162,The oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve may be shifted to the right in which of the following conditions?,Carbon monoxide poisoning,Decrease in pCO2 concentration,Fall in temperature below 37°C,"Increase in 2,3-DPG",pH increasing to 7.48,D,"The oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is a graph that shows the per cent saturation of haemoglobin at different partial pressures of oxygen. The normal oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is said to be at equilibrium when:  The pH is 7.40 The pCO2 is 40 mmHg The 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) concentration is 15 µmol/g Hb The temperature is 37°C.  Any alteration in these four physiological factors may result in a change in affinity of the haemoglobin for oxygen and thus the shape of the curve. An increase in temperature (denatures the bond between oxygen and haemoglobin thus decreasing the concentration of oxyhaemoglobin), increase in CO2 concentration, increase in 2,3-DPG (2,3-DPG binds to haemoglobin which rearranges the haemoglobin into the T-state, thus decreasing the affinity of oxygen for haemoglobin) or a fall in pH (due to the Bohr effect) causes a reduction in the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. All these factors cause a deviation of the curve to the right. Similarly, a decrease in the temperature, a decrease in CO2 concentration, a decrease in 2,3-DPG, or a rise in pH increases the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. This causes a shift of the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve to the left. Carbon monoxide poisoning shifts the curve to the left due to the inhibition of synthesis of 2,3-DPG."
basic medicine,163,A 75-year-old man presents with irritative and obstructive urinary symptoms of six months duration. He has noticed occasional haematuria and associated nocturia five times a night. PR examination and subsequent prostate biopsy confirms prostate cancer. What histological grading system is used to grade prostate cancer?,Ann Arbor,Breslow's depth,Duke's,Gleason,TNM staging,D,"TNM staging is used for the majority of cancers but it is a staging system, not a grading system. Ann Arbor is used to stage lymphoma. Duke's staging is historically used for colon cancer but is less used in modern practice. Breslow's depth is used in melanoma. Gleason grading takes account of the most prevalent tumour pattern in the pathological system (1-5) and the second most prevalent tumour pattern (1-5). It is presented as, for example, Gleason 3+4 = 7. This is important as a Gleason 4+3 = 7 obviously has a worse prognosis than a Gleason 3+4 = 7 even though they both have the same total score."
basic medicine,164,A 70-year-old woman is referred with a breast lump. She is otherwise well. Investigations:    Corrected calcium 2.72 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Phosphate 0.80 mmol/L (0.8-1.4)   Alkaline phosphatase 110 U/L (45-105)   PTH concentration 5.1 pmol/L (0.9-5.4)    Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Bony metastases,Chronic vitamin D excess,Ectopic PTH related peptide (PTHrp) secretion,Multiple myeloma,Primary hyperparathyroidism,E,"This patient has hypercalcaemia with a borderline low phosphate concentration but an inappropriately normal parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentration. This suggests hyperparathyroidism which is a relatively common disorder amongst elderly females. Vitamin D excess would be expected to cause an elevated phosphate. Bony metastases and multiple myeloma can both result in hypercalcaemia, which should result in a suppressed PTH. PTH related peptide is a common cause of hypercalcaemia in malignancy. It is not usually detected by normal lab tests for PTH and therefore you would expect a low PTH in the setting of hyperclcaemia. If this was multiple myeloma you would expect a physiological decrease in PTH as a response to the hypercalaemia. PTH is inappropriately normal here, as mentioned above, which should lead you to a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism."
basic medicine,165,Which of the following is a cause of metabolic acidosis?,Calcium antacids,Hypochloraemia,Hypokalaemia,Hyponatraemia,Shock,E,"The causes of a metabolic acidosis include:  Renal failure Gastrointestinal bicarbonate loss Drug poisoning (for example, salicylates, diabetes mellitus, starvation and lactic acidosis).

basic medicine,167,Which one of the following drugs increases the rate of gastric emptying?,Codeine,Dopexamine,Erythromycin,Loperamide,Vancomycin,C,"Pro-kinetic drugs increase the rate of gastric emptying and intestinal motility. Metoclopramide, cisapride and erythromycin have all been successfully used in this role. Loperamide is an opioid agonist which reduces intestinal motility. Dopexamine increases splanchnic perfusion but does not have pro-kinetic properties. Vancomycin similarly has no therapeutic effect on intestinal motility."
basic medicine,168,Which of the following is true of Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)?,Is associated with disseminated cancer,Can be caused by pulmonary embolism,Results in a hyaline membrane,Causes increased lung compliance,Results in patchy consolidation on a chest radiograph,C,"Adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is an acute, diffuse, inflammatory process, resulting from direct or indirect pulmonary injury. ARDS is most commonly seen in patients with sepsis, but can also occur after:  Trauma Burns Inhalation injuries Shock, and Pancreatitis.  Indirect or direct lung injury initiates an abnormal behaviour and movement of neutrophils, platelets and macrophages. Neutrophils and platelets attach to capillary endothelium, causing capillary leakage. This leads to oedema of lung tissue and thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane. In addition, some of the fluid in the pulmonary parenchyma may leak into the alveoli, giving the characteristic appearance of a hyaline membrane. Pulmonary fibrosis in the later stages of the disease leads to:  A decrease in the functional residual capacity Further decrease in lung compliance, and An increase in the shunt effect.  Pulmonary signs are often minimal or non-specific, the patient simply being breathless, progressively tachypnoeic, hypoxic and then cyanotic. Chest radiograph may be normal in the early stages but later shows bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltration."

basic medicine,176,A 65 year old patient with chronic renal failure is discovered to have slightly low calcium levels. His phosphate is high and PTH is elevated. What is the most likely cause?,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Secondary Hyperparathyroidism,Hypoparathyroidism,Reduced vitamin D absorption,Pseudohypoparathyroidism,B,In CRF there is reduced hydroxylation of vitamin D which leads to hypocalcaemia. This leads to an increased PTH and although normally this would lead to reduced phosphate there is reduced renal excretion of phosphate and therefore it is elevated. In hypoparathyroidism there would be low PTH. In pseudohypoparathyroidism there is failure to respond to PTH and this leads to elevated PTH and low calcium however this presents earlier and is not the likely cause in chronic renal failure. In primary hyperparathyroidism there is elevated calcium.
basic medicine,177,"You are asked to provide advice on a 35-year-old woman who is admitted under the maxillo-facial surgeons for extraction of wisdom teeth. The only concern was that she had developed prolonged bleeding following a tooth extraction 10 years previously and had required suturing. Besides this, she gave no other history of bleeding. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Factor V Leiden,Factor IX deficiency,Factor XII deficiency,Primary antiphospholipid syndrome,von Willebrand's disease,E,"Not that much is given away by this history just the issue of a prolonged bleed after prior dental extraction. The most likely diagnosis when considering this patient is von Willebrand's disease which is an autosomal dominant condition and is one of the commonest bleeding disorders. Most cases are mild, with bleeding after only mild injury, particularly mucosal membrane injuries. The condition is due to a reduction or structural abnormality of von Willebrand's factor, which has the dual role of promoting normal platelet function and stabilising coagulation factor VIII. von Willebrand's disease can give normal results on screening tests and diagnosis may require specialist investigation. Most patients with mild disease respond to desmopressin (DDAVP) but clotting factor concentrates are needed for a minority."

At a chemical level, there are two types of bacterial toxins  Lipopolysaccharides, which are associated with the cell walls of Gram negative bacteria, and Proteins, which are released from bacterial cells and may act at tissue sites removed from the site of bacterial growth.  The lipopolysaccharide toxins are referred to as endotoxins and the extracellular diffusible toxins are referred to as exotoxins. Exotoxins are soluble proteins produced by the living bacteria and are generally specific for the pathogenic bacteria involved (can be produced by both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria, for example, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli). Bacterial protein toxins are the most powerful human poisons known and retain high activity at very high dilutions. Their effect may be neutralised by the antitoxin and this is used as a treatment (toxoid)."

basic medicine,214,Which of the following physiological changes may occur during a laparoscopic procedure in a fit patient?,Alteration in the left ventricular function,An increase in cardiac output secondary to direct pressure on the inferior vena cava and pelvic veins,"Decrease in the systemic vascular resistance by a combination of mechanical pressure on the aorta and splanchnic vessels, and release of catecholamines",Reduction in the renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GRF) due to decreased vasopressin levels,Release of inflammatory mediators as a direct result of afferent neuronal stimulation from the peritoneum,E,"Peritoneal insufflation with or without Trendelenburg position may result in an increase in systemic vascular resistance (and therefore rise in mean arterial blood pressure) by mechanical compression of the aorta and splanchnic vessels, and the release of catecholamines, prostaglandins, renin and vasopressin. Direct pressure on the inferior vena cava and pelvic veins leads to decreased venous return, and therefore a fall in cardiac output. (This effect may be to some extent compensated for by blood entering the central vascular space from the inferior vena cava and splanchnic bed.) Increased renal vascular resistance, decreased cardiac output and elevated vasopressin levels all lead to a fall in renal blood flow and GFR. Left ventricular function is unaltered in fit patients. The metabolic response to laparoscopic surgery (mediated by neuroendocrine stimulation and release of inflammatory mediators) may be caused by afferent neuronal stimulation from the peritoneum."

There is also usually a raised anti-HBc after previous infection but not after immunisation. These indicate immunity to this infection. During the incubation period HBsAg and HBeAg (an indicator of viral replication) are elevated. Anti-HBc is the first antibody to appear early in the illness. High titres of IgM anti-HBc suggest an acute and continuing viral replication in the period (variable: around 3-6 months) after HBsAg has disappeared and before anti-HBs is present.

The fibrillar insoluble protein is always associated with a non-fibrillar component, amyloid-P component. Amyloid-P component is derived from the acute phase protein serum amyloid-P. In haematoxylin and eosin (Handamp;E) stained paraffin-embedded tissue sections, deposits of amyloid appear as homogeneous, eosinophilic material in the interstitium and walls of blood vessels, and bind the Congo red dye, and its characteristic apple green birefringence under polarised microscopy. AL amyloid (primary) is associated with bone marrow abnormalites and myeloma. It is the most common form (55%). AA amyloid (secondary) is associated with chronic inflammatory disease (5% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis) including inflammatory bowel disease. Brain involvement is uncommon in systemic amyloidosis. Amyloidosis may occur in medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. Men are more frequently affected. Liver, kidneys, heart and bowel are most frequently involved. Amyloid causes renal failure due to its deposition within the kidney. Amyloid may occur after 5 years of dialysis. This may be reversed by renal transplantation. The incidence is reducing as dialysis techniques improve. Heart failure may result from cardiac deposition. A heart transplant may be required. Treatment may partly reverse the condition but not provide a cure. "

basic medicine,234,Which of the following antiemetics functions through antagonism of the 5-hydroxytryptamine 3A receptor?,Aprepitant,Domperidone,Hyoscine,Metoclopramide,Ondansetron,E,"Ondansetron is a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist used mainly to treat nausea and vomiting following chemotherapy. Its effects are thought to be on both peripheral and central nerves. One part is to reduce the activity of the vagus nerve, which is a nerve that activates the vomiting center in the medulla oblongata, the other is a blockage of serotonin receptors in the chemoreceptor trigger zone. It does not have much effect on vomiting due to motion sickness. This drug does not have any effect on dopamine receptors or muscarinic receptors."
basic medicine,235,"A 63-year-old female presents with dry mouth of three months duration. She is taking medication for hypertension, stress incontinence and reflux oesophagitis. Which of the following is most likely to be responsible for her dry mouth?",Bendroflumethiazide,Cimetidine,Doxazosin,Hydralazine,Oxybutinin,E,"Oxybutinin is an effective treatment for detrussor instability and is a parasympathetic muscarinic antagonist. Consequently dry mouth is a problem in up to 70% of cases. Bendroflumethiazide, the thiazide diuretic, at a dose of 2.5 mg per day is not associated with dry mouth. Cimetidine is an H2 antagonist and is not associated with dry mouth. Doxazosin is an alpha-blocker used as an anthihypertensive and is associated with a dry mouth in less than 5% of patients.  Hydralazine is a vasodilator and is not commonly linked to a dry mouth."
basic medicine,236,What family of virus does Rubella belong to?,Poxviruses,Parvoviruses,Reoviruses,Togaviruses,Retroviruses,D,"Rubella is a type of Togavirus. It should be noted that when using virus terminology (taxon structure) the suffix changes according to the level of order.

basic medicine,244,A medicolegal claim is brought against a hospital because of injuries a child has sustained during birth. She has been left with wasting of the muscles of her hand which causes her problems with holding on to objects. There is also loss of sensation over the inner forearm and fingers. Her hand is clawed. Where is the lesion?,Lower brachial plexus,Median nerve,Musculocutaneous nerve,Radial nerve,Upper brachial plexus,A,"The affected area is the lower brachial plexus (C[7], 8; T1), this is also known as Klumpke's palsy. The mechanism of injury is most likely to be forced abduction of the arm. Delivery when a baby has shoulder dystocia may cause upward traction of the arm. This may damage the lower brachial plexus. Most such obstetric injuries recover by 6 months. Otherwise, some recovery may continue until the age of about 2. Horner's syndrome can also occur if the T1 nerve root is affected. Lesions affecting the upper brachial plexus would lead to Erb-Duchenne paralysis (waiter's tip position)."

basic medicine,248,Sympathetic nerve supply to the uterus is supplied by which of the following spinal nerves?,"L1, L2, L3 and L4","T9, T10, T11 and T12","L4, L5, S1 and S2","T10, T11, T12 and L1","S1, S2, S3 and S4",D,"Autonomic sympathetic nerve supply to the uterus and pelvis is from the inferior hypogastric plexus (AKA the pelvic plexus) which if formed from T10, T11, T12 and L1 nerve roots. Pelvic anatomy: Nerve Supply & labour Sympathetic nervesAutonomic sympathetic nerve supply to the uterus and pelvis is from the inferior hypogastric plexus (AKA the pelvic plexus) which if formed from T10, T11, T12 and L1 nerve roots. The inferior hypogastric plexus supplies the uterus and cervix. Labour pains are therefore referred to these dermatomes. (this includes the lumbo-sacral region, lower abdomen and loins) Labour pains related to uterine contractions are referred to T10-L1 dermatomes.More specifically:Labour pain is referred to the dermatomes T11 and T12 in the early stage of labour. Pain then spreads to the adjacent T10 and L1 dermatomes. Eventually sacral dermatomes S2-S4 are involved during the second stage of labour and delivery (see below)Parasympathetic nervesThe vagina and pelvic outlet are supplied by the pudendal nerve, genito-femoral nerve and perineal branch of the posterior femoral nerve. Of these the pudendal nerve is the major contributing nerve.

The prognosis is good with 80% resolving spontaneously, and have a normal CXR after one year. Hypercalcaemia (2-10%) and hypercalciuria (up to 50%) are well recognised in sarcoidosis. The pattern resembles hypervitaminosis D, with:  Elevated serum calcium Normal serum phosphate and Normal/slightly raised alkaline phosphotase.  There is elevated 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol due to increased production by alveolar pulmonary macrophages and macrophages in granulomata. Treat with rehydration and corticosteroids. Serum ACE is produced by sarcoid granulomata from activation and differentiation of monocyte-macrophage system. It is a membrane bound glycoprotein, found mainly in the lung capillary endothelium. ACE has poor diagnostic sensitivity (ability to detect disease) and specificity (ability to exclude disease), but is raised in active sarcoidosis. It is useful in monitoring of disease activity. Sarcoidosis is chronic multisystem non-caseating granulomatous disease. Central fibrinoid necrosis may occur, but tends to be focal and limited unlike the purulent necrosis/caseation seen in tuberculosis."

basic medicine,252,"A patient is suspected of having taken a substance with anticholinesterase effects. Which of the following combinations of signs, if present, would be the most likely to confirm this effect?",Bradycardia and miosis,Bradycardia and mydriasis,Bradycardia and urinary retention,Tachycardia and diarrhoea,Tachycardia and lacrimation,A,"An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor or anticholinesterase is a chemical that inhibits the cholinesterase enzyme from breaking down acetylcholine (ACh), so increasing both the level and duration of action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. ACh can stimulate postganglionic receptors to produce effects such as:  Salivation Lacrimation Defecation Micturition Sweating Miosis Bradycardia, and Bronchospasm.  Muscarine produces these effects, and hence they are referred to as muscarinic effects, and the postganglionic receptors are called muscarine receptors. SLUD (Salivation,Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation - and emesis) is a syndrome of pathological effects indicative of massive discharge of the parasympathetic nervous system. Unlikely to occur naturally, SLUD is usually encountered only in cases of drug overdose or exposure to nerve gases. Nerve gases irreversibly inhibit the enzyme acetylcholinesterase; this results in a chronically high level of acetylcholine at cholinergic synapses throughout the body, thus chronically stimulating acetylcholine receptors throughout the body."
basic medicine,253,Which of the following statements is true concerning gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)?,Increased GGT is found in fatty liver,Isolated elevation of gamma GT in a patient with prostatic carcinoma Indicates the presence of hepatic metastases. ,It is a better indicator of infectious hepatitis than of cholestasis ,It is only present in the liver,Serum activity is typically elevated in pregnancy ,A,"GGT is found in muscle, prostate as well as liver. Increased levels of GGT are found in cholestatic liver disease and in hepatocellular disease when there is an element of cholestasis. Levels are increased with chronic intake of excess alcohol and with certain drugs (especially phenytoin), as a result of enzyme induction. Pancreatitis and prostatitis may also be associated with increased levels. Levels may be normal early in the course of acute hepatocellular damage, for example, acute viral hepatitis, paracetamol hepatotoxicity. Elevations in pregnancy would suggest liver disease."
basic medicine,254,Which structure passes through the greater sciatic foramen?,Lateral sacral artery,Nerve to pectineus,Posterior cutaneous nerve of the thigh,Sacrospinous ligament,Tendon of obturator internus,C,"The greater sciatic foramen transmits seven nerves (including the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve), three vessels and one muscle (pyriformis). The sacrospinous ligament forms part of the foramen itself. Remember, the nerve to obturator internus passes out through the greater sciatic foramen and then re-enters through he lesser sciatic foramen onto the pelvic surface of the muscle. The tendon of the obturator internus muscle and its nerve pass through the lesser sciatic foramen. The nerve to pectineus is a branch of the femoral nerve which passes behind the femoral sheath to enter the anterior surface of the muscle."

basic medicine,268,Which of the following statements regarding prognosis in lung cancer is true?,"Combined modality therapy (chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery) has improved overall lung cancer survival to 40% at five years",Overall lung cancer survival is less than 15% at five years,Patients undergoing radiation therapy have a five year survival of 40%,Patients who qualify for surgery have a 50% five year survival,"With chemotherapy, overall survival in small cell carcinomas has risen to 60% at five years",B,"Prognosis is related to staging and tumour type. It is higher with a lesion that is confined and resectable (no LAP with no distant metastases) and is not of the small cell type. However, overall five year survival for patients is still of the order of 14%. (American Cancer Society 1998). This contrasts with approximately 50% for cancer of the breast and around 70% for cancer of the cervix. Overall, only about 20% of cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are regarded as suitable candidates for resection at presentation. Surgery can be used to treat patients with stage 1A-3A NSCLC (surgery is not indicated in SCLC routinely). The prognosis for patients with stage 1A NSCLC is ~60-70% 5 year survival, whereas that for patients with stage 3A disease is 20-25%. Therefore it is inaccurate to say all patients who are suitable for surgical treatment have a 50% 5 year survival. Prognosis for small cell cancer despite treatment is still poor, despite it being very chemo and radiosensitive - 10% at five years."

basic medicine,380,Which of the following statements is true of wound infections?,Anaerobic organisms exert their lethal effects by producing endo- and exotoxins,MRSA wound infection is usually the result of wound contamination by the patient,Necrotising fasciitis is commoner in carriers of MRSA,Opportunistic organisms tend to affect young healthy adults,Streptococcus is the most common organism to infect the surgical wound,A,"As part of sepsis, toxins damage the endothelium of the lung capillaries. The accompanying inflammatory response results in oedematous changes and haemodynamic instability. MRSA wound infection is usually hospital acquired and the risk of acquisition can be minimised by basic precautions such as hand washing before wound inspection. Sepsis and its sequelae such as acute respiratory distress syndrome illustrate this principle. Necrotising fasciitis is a deep-seated aggressive infection of subcutaneous tissue and skin. It is commonly caused by group A Streptococci.  There is no evidence to suggest it is commoner in carriers of MRSA. Surgical wounds become infected with opportunistic organisms because of the relatively immunocompromised state of the post-operative patient resulting in reduced microbial inhibitions. Staphylococci are the most common organism to infect the surgical wound as they are common skin commensals. Staphylococci are aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, Gram positive cocci."

basic medicine,388,"Miss L is a 25-year-old woman attending the general medical clinic. For the last six months she has felt generally fatigued and has noticed abdominal bloating. She has multiple symptoms that have been troubling her for the last few years and her GP would like some advice on diagnosis and management. She has also been troubled by large, painful mouth ulcers that can be so severe that she is unable to eat. She says that she has had mouth ulcers since she was a teenager and gets them at least once per week. She complains of joint pains affecting her hands and knees, and reports one brief episode of swelling of the right knee that resolved after a week or so of painkillers. Last year, she was seen urgently by the ophthalmologists when she developed an acutely red and painful left eye associated with blurred vision and photophobia. She cannot remember what the diagnosis was, but was treated with steroid drops and this has not bothered her since. On further questioning, you find out that she has also been seen in the GUM clinic complaining of painful vulval ulceration. Swabs and blood samples were taken, but no diagnosis was reached. The symptoms have recurred twice since the first episode two years ago. You read the referral letter from her GP who describes an episode of erythema nodosum last year. He also mentions that she was treated for a DVT following a trip to Cyprus when she was 17. What is the likely unifying diagnosis?",Behçet's disease,Brucellosis,Crohn's disease,Fibromyalgia,Systemic lupus erythematosus,A,"The combination of venous ulceration, iritis, mouth ulceration and arthritis is typical of Behçet's disease. Behçet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis with an unknown aetiology, which affects small and large vessels (venous and arterial). More than 60% of patients are HLA-B51, and there is an increased prevalence in the Mediterranean countries. It is commonly associated with mucocutaneous manifestations (oro-genital ulceration, erythema nodosum), ocular disease, gastrointestinal involvement and neurological features. Venous thrombosis is a common complication, but arterial occlusion can also occur. The International Study Group criteria for classification of Behçet's disease requires the presence of recurrent oral ulceration (minor aphthous, major aphthous or herpetiform ulceration observed by physician or patient, which have recurred at least three times in a 12 month period), and two of the following:  Recurrent genital ulceration - aphthous ulceration or scarring, observed by physician or patient Eye lesions - anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, or cells in vitreous on slit lamp examination; or retinal vasculitis observed by ophthalmologist Skin lesions - erythema nodosum observed by physician or patient, pseudofolliculitis or papulopustular lesions; or acneiform nodules observed by the physician in post-adolescent patients not on corticosteroid treatment Positive pathergy test - read by physician at 24-48 hours  Pathergy is the non-specific hyper-reactivity of the skin following minor trauma, and is specific to Behçet's disease. It involves intradermal injection of skin with a 20-gauge needle under sterile conditions. It is considered positive if an erythematous sterile papule develops within 48 hours. Brucellosis is an infective condition which presents most commonly with fever and malaise. It does not fit with the above scenario. This presentation is not typical of Crohn's disease - one would expect a history of diarrhoea, abdominal pain and/or PR bleeding. Fibromyalgia presents with pain and tenderness in a number of muscles . Extra-articular features such as genital ulceration are not seen. Whilst a number of the features described in this scenario could fit with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and/or antiphospholipid syndrome the history of oral and genital ulceration is much more typical of Behçet's disease.

Although cinacalcet is useful in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic renal disease it should not be commenced when a patient is hypocalcaemic as although it lowers PTH levels it also lowers serum calcium levels. Risedronate is not useful in this case as it will not improve calcium and PTH levels and should be used in caution in renal disease. Again strontium ranelate has no role to play in this example.
basic medicine,392,Which drug has side-effects including tachycardia and flushing?,Enalapril,Labetalol,Captopril,Hydralazine,Methyldopa,D,"HYDRALAZINE• Vasodilator (arterioles more than venules) by direct effect on vascular smooth muscle and reduces cardiac after-load • Also has antioxidant effects, reducing superoxide formation and enhancing the vasodilator effects of nitric oxide • Excessive superoxide counteracts NO-induced vasodilation. It is commonly used in the condition of pregnancy calledpreeclampsia• Hydralazine-induced decrease in blood pressure is accompanied by increased heart rate, cardiac output, and strokevolume secondary to reflex response to decreased peripheral resistance• No direct effect on cardiac function• Increases renin activity in plasma leading to increased production of angiotensin II and sodium reabsorption with fluidretention.• Tolerance to the antihypertensive effect of the drug may therefore develops with long-term use especially if a diureticis not administered concurrently• Rapidly and extensively absorbed from the gut and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism by geneticpolymorphic acetylation.

It is critical to distinguish between whether the patient has had external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy or use of an unsealed source. External beam radiotherapy or use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy does not render the patient radioactive. Use of brachytherapy methods can involve insertion of radioactive seeds or beads which may require some radiation protection precautions depending on the site. Use of an unsealed source, for example radio-iodine treatment of thyroid cancer, has substantial need for precautions and patients need to be isolated in a lead-lined side room, often for several days."

basic medicine,421,Which of the following is true regarding prostaglandins?,Causes uterine dilatation,Decreases blood flow to the kidneys,Increases gastric acid secretion,Leads to inflammatory responses,Reduces pain,D,"Prostaglandins act as chemical messengers at the site where they are synthesised. They are thus different from hormones, which can be transported in the blood and can act in distant sites in the body. Prostaglandins have a variety of physiological effects. They activate the inflammatory response at the site of tissue injury, leading to pain, swelling, redness and increase in temperature. They also have haemostatic properties, such as when there is blood vessel damage (thromboxane stimulates vasoconstriction and activation of platelets). Prostaglandins stimulate uterine contractions and thus are effective in inducing labour. They inhibit acid synthesis (including gastric acid) and increase secretion of protective mucus within the GI tract. They also increase blood flow in kidneys and are cause constriction of bronchi, thus exacerbating bronchial asthma."
basic medicine,422,With respect to the action of DNA polymerases,DNA polymerase gamma – synthesizes the leading strand of DNA,DNA polymerase alpha – repairs DNA,DNA polymerase beta – replicated DNA at telomeres,DNA polymerase alpha – synthesizes the lagging strand of DNA,DNA polymerase delta – produces Okazaki fragments,D,DNA replication• DNA helix is unwound by DNA helicase at 20-80 sites forming replicons or replicationunits• There are 5 DNA polymerase enzymes which are responsible for replication:• Polymerase - alpha synthesizes the lagging strand via Okazaki fragments• Polymerase beta and epsilon repair DNA• Polymerase delta synthesizes the leading strand• Polymerase gamma replicates mitochondrial DNA• Telomerase is a DNA polymerase with an integral RNA that acts as its own primer andreplicates DNA at the ends of chromosomes (telomeres)• Replication is initiated by the synthesis of a primer sequence of RNA. Chain elongationoccurs in the 5' to 3' direction on the leading strand and in Okazaki fragments on the laggingstrand (discontinuous). The fragments are joined by DNA ligase• Histones do not dissociate from DNA prior to replication. Histones are also synthesizedduring the S phase and the old nucleosomes stay with the daughter DNA molecule containingthe leading strand while new nucleosomes assemble on the daughter molecule containing thelagging strand. • Rapidly dividing (malignant) cells are most sensitive to anti-metabolite chemotherapyduring the S phase of the cell cycle
basic medicine,423,You are using diathermy to control bleeding prior to closing a surgical incision. What is the SI unit of diathermy power?,Joule,Volt,Ampere,Hertz,Watt,E,The SI unit of power is the watt. A watt (W) is equivalent to one joule per second. Diathermy Diathermy BasicsIn surgical diathermy (or electrosurgery) AC current is passed through a conductor with some energy appearing as heat. There are 2 types of DiathermyMonopolar Current passed from small electrode held by surgeon and returned to a large area plate via patients tissues. The concentrated current at the electrode tip produces a lot of heat whereas the current is dissipated over a large area at the plate.It is important the plate is properly attached as if the plate area is reduced the current concentrates and can cause tissue burnsBipolar Current passes between two electrodes held by surgeon as forceps.Diathermy can be used for cutting or coagulating. Bipolar is used to coagulate not cut. In cutting (monopoly) the waveform can be varied. A continuous single frequency sine wave is often used. Pulsed waves can reduce local thermal tissue damage. To prevent cell deploarisation (especially in cardiac tissue) the frequency must be over 100 kHz. Below this electric shock or even electrocution could occur. In surgical practice frequencies of around 500KHz are used.

basic medicine,426,Which of the following statements is correct regarding papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland?,After destruction of the normal thyroid tissue by tumour there is still uptake of iodine,Has a better prognosis than follicular carcinoma,Has a good response to chemotherapy,Is associated with hypocalcaemia in 20% of cases,Is the second most common cause of thyroid malignancy,B,Most papillary thyroid tumours are 'cold' on radioisotope scan (^123I or ^99mTc). Some 20% will have normal or increased uptake. About 50% of tumours retain some ability to concentrate iodine. This explains the response of metastases to ^131I. Radioactive iodine can be used to ablate any remaining thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy for well-differentiated tumours larger than 1 cm diameter. Prognosis (10-year survival):  Papillary carcinoma 80% Follicular 60% Medullary (C cell) 50% Anaplastic 0%.  Chemotherapy (doxorubicin) is of little benefit. The mainstay of treatment is ^131I treatment. External beam radiotherapy may help in the treatment of bone metastases. Medullary carcinomas (from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid) secrete calcitonin. About 20% of these are associated with multiple endocrine adenomatosis (MEA) II a or b. Papillary carcinoma is the commonest thyroid malignancy (60%). The others are:  Follicular (25%) Anaplastic (10%) Medullary (C cell) (5%) Lymphoma (~1%).
basic medicine,427,A 53-year-old lady has recently undergone submandibular gland excision for recurrent sialadenitis. Review on the ward round reveals that she has some drooping to one corner of her mouth. Which nerve has been damaged during the surgery?,The buccal branch of the facial nerve,The cervical branch of the facial nerve,The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve,The mental nerve,The zygomatic branch of the facial nerve,C,The marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve lies below the mandible for part of its course. Therefore submandibular incisions should be made well below the mandible to avoid damage to the nerve which results in drooping of the corner of the mouth.
basic medicine,428,Which of the following is correct regarding the pharmacokinetics of antibiotics?,Aminoglycosides are absorbed well by the gut,Intramuscular preparation should be avoided in hypoperfusion states,Most antibiotics are better absorbed with food,Oral antibiotics are absorbed principally from the terminal ileum,Topical antibiotics are rapidly absorbed through the skin,B,"Oral antibiotics are absorbed principally in the stomach and proximal small bowel. Tissue absorption when given by the intramuscular route is unreliable and is reduced further in poor tissue perfusion. Aminoglycosides are not absorbed by the oral route and require intravenous administration. Topical antibiotics are poorly absorbed and therefore tend to be used less often. Most antibiotics are best absorbed on an empty stomach, however, there are some exceptions, for example, doxycycline."

Insulinomas produce high levels of both insulin and C peptide in a 1 to 1 ratio. C peptide is suggested to have some antiinflammatory effects and low levels of C peptide relative to insulin suggests factitious hypoglycaemia due to exogenous insulin use.
basic medicine,431,Which of the following is a recognised carcinogen?,Infrared radiation,Beta‐naphthylamine,Nicotine,Aerosol spray,Electromagnetic microwaves,B,"Nicotine is not a carcinogen, it is the hydrocarbons/tar in the smoke that predisposes to carcinoma.Naphthas are associated with bladder tumours.There is no demonstrable association between infrared waves and risk of malignancy (ask a submariner).Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (not infrared) predisposes to skin cancers."
basic medicine,432,"A newborn infant is born with a protrusion of his abdominal contents (liver, spleen, intestine and bladder) in a sac from which the umbilical cord arises. What is the diagnosis?",Cryptorchism,Exomphalos,Gastroschisis,Hirschsprung’s disease,Imperforate anus,B,All of the features described are consistent with exomphalos. In this condition the abdominal contents are contained in a sac. The main differential would have been gastroschisis in which there is no sac and the umbilical cord arises from its normal position. Crytorchism describes the presence of a testicle in an abnormal position. Hirschsprung's disease is a cause of childhood constipation due to absence of autonomic ganglion cells in the Auerbach's plexus in the large intestine. Imperforate anus is a birth defect in which the rectum is malformed.
basic medicine,433,A 45-year-old Ghanaian man presents to hospital with a right sided middle lobe pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae is isolated from blood cultures. What is the likeliest underlying association?,Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID),HIV,HTLV-1,IgA deficiency,Terminal complement deficiency,B,"Streptococcus pneumoniae, is a Gram-positive diplococcus which is carried asymptomatically in approximately 50% of people. It can cause both non-invasive and invasive disease. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) refers to disease in which the bacterium enters a sterile site such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid or pericardial fluid. Non-invasive disease includes otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia and bronchitis. This gentleman has grown the organism from his blood cultures and therefore has IPD by definition. This is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in children and adults. Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) is 20-30 times more common in HIV-infected patients compared to non-HIV infected patients. Consideration should be given to offering HIV testing to all patients with IPD presenting to hospital. Other immunodeficiency syndromes are associated with an increased risk of IPD, but the majority of these present in childhood. These include X-linked (Bruton's) agammaglobulinaemia, common variable immunodeficiency, asplenia (anatomical or functional) and sickle cell disease. The other causes of immunodeficiency are not associated with IPD. "
basic medicine,434,A 17-year- old girl with severe anorexia nervosais is commenced on nasogastric feeding. Five days later she becomes increasingly confused. She is apyrexial and appears appropriately hydrated. Her pulse is 98 bpm and blood pressure 96/60 mmHg. Which is the most appropriate diagnostic investigation?,Arterial blood gases,Serum phosphate,Serum calcium,Serum sodium,Vitamin B concentrations,B,"The patient appears to have developed the refeeding syndrome. Refeeding malnourished patients increases basal metabolic rate, with glucose being the predominant energy source. This anabolic response causes intracellular movement of minerals, and serum levels may fall significantly. These rapid changes in metabolism and electrolyte movement may lead to severe cardiorespiratory and neurological problems resulting in:  Cardiac and respiratory failure Oedema Lethargy Confusion Coma Convulsions, and Death.  The symptoms of the refeeding syndrome are thought to be due predominantly to hypophosphataemia, but metabolic changes in potassium, magnesium, glucose, and thiamine can also contribute. The probable answer here is therefore phosphate as hypophosphataemia seems probable. Calcium depletion is possible but there is absence of tetany. Zinc deficiency causes skin rashes periorally and around nostrils. It is extremely difficult to measure vitamin B concentrations, plus her presentation does not sound like Wernicke's neuro-ophthalmological features. "

It is placed behind the symphysis pubis, embedded in the anterior wall of the vagina, and its direction is obliquely downward and forward; it is slightly curved with the concavity directed forward. Its lining is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, which becomes transitional near the bladder. The urethra consists of three coats:  Muscular Erectile, and Mucous.  The muscular layer is a continuation of that of the bladder. Between the superior and inferior fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, the female urethra is surrounded by the sphincter urethrae. Somatic innervation of the external urethral sphincter is supplied by the pudendal nerve. The uro-genital sinus may be divided into three component parts. The first of these is the cranial portion which is continuous with the allantois and forms the bladder proper. The pelvic part of the sinus forms the prostatic urethra and epithelium as well as the membranous urethra and bulbo urethral glands in the male and the membranous urethra and part of the vagina in females."

Remodeling is usually underway by day 21.Wound Healing Wound healing is typically divided into four phases. The four phases of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase: This is the initial phase that starts immediately after the injury occurs. The body's response involves vasoconstriction and the formation of a blood clot .Inflammatory Phase: Following hemostasis, the inflammatory phase begins and can last for several days. During this phase, the body triggers an inflammatory response to remove debris, foreign substances, and bacteria from the wound. Immune cells, growth factors, and other chemicals are released to initiate the healing process.Proliferative Phase: After the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase starts, lasting for several weeks. New tissue is formed through the action of fibroblasts, which produce collagen, and other cells. The wound is filled with granulation tissue, which contains new blood vessels and collagen.Remodeling Phase: The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase. It can last for several months to years after the injury. During this phase, the collagen fibers reorganize and gain strength, and the wound contracts and becomes smaller. The goal is to improve the wound's tensile strength and functionality, although it may not reach the original strength of the uninjured tissue entirely."

basic medicine,470,"A 64-year-old lady is undergoing a right total hip replacement. The surgeon's preferred approach to the hip joint is the lateral approach. To reach the hip joint, he splits the tensor fascia lata, and then gluteus medius and minimus. During this approach, the nerve supply to the tensor fascia lata and gluteus medius is at risk. What nerve innervates this muscle?",Femoral nerve,Lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the thigh,Posterior branch of obturator nerve,Sciatic nerve,Superior gluteal nerve,E,"The superior gluteal nerve arises from the ventral rami of L4- S1. It leaves the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen. It supplies the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus and tensor fascia lata muscles. There are several different approaches to the hip and different nerves may be damaged depending on which approach is used. The posterior approach to the hip joint involves an incision through the deep fascia and gluteus maximus and then division of the external rotators. The sciatic nerve is in danger with this approach. The anterior approach involves the planes between tensor fascia lata and sartorius and then rectus femoris and gluteus medius. The lateral femoral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is in danger with this approach."
basic medicine,471,Which of the following are potassium sparing diuretics?,Doxazosin,Bendroflumethiazide,Furosemide,Captopril,Triamterene,E,"Potassium sparing diuretics include spironolactone, triamterene and amiloride. They act on the distal convoluted tubule inhibiting, through various mechanisms, the loss of potassium in exchange for sodium.Captopril is not a diuretic but an angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Doxazosin is an alpha blocker.Furosemide is a loop diuretic, and bendroflumethiazide a thiazide diuretic."
basic medicine,472,Which of the following statements regarding intravenous solutions is correct?,0.18 saline in 4.0% dextrose is appropriate for the initial management of an infant with signs of peripheral circulatory failure,Normal saline contains 180 mmol/l of sodium,Normal saline with added potassium is appropriate therapy to correct a non-respiratory alkalosis,Ringer's lactate solution is designed for intracellular fluid replacement,Sodium bicarbonate 8.4% is a hypo-osmolar solution,C,"Normal saline contains 154 mmol/L of sodium. Ringer's solution is also known as Hartmann's solution. It is a crystalloid and contains 131 mmol/L of sodium and 111 mmol/L of chloride. It is ideally balanced. In an extracellular loss, such as diarrhoea or haemorrhage, sodium falls and therefore administration of a hyponatraemic solution may further compound the problem. Ringer's is more appropriate. Sodium bicarbonate 8.4% is a hyperosmolar solution with an osmolarity of approximately 2,000 mOsmol/L. 0.18% saline in 4% dextrose is also called dextrose saline. It is a crystalloid containing 30 mmol/L of sodium and 30 mmol/L Cl. A child showing signs of hypovolaemia or signs of a peripheral circulatory collapse needs to be resuscitated, preferably with plasma expanders. These include colloid fluids such as blood or plasma. They exert an oncotic pressure and thus retain fluid in the circulating volume. Crystalloid fluids containing iso- or hypotonic concentrations of sodium do not remain in the plasma volume following IV administration. The volume of distribution of these fluids is extracellular and thus only provides a short term expansion of the circulating volume. Normal saline with additional potassium is used in the correction of metabolic alkalosis."

basic medicine,474,Which of the following is correct regarding the relations of the abdominal structures?,The abdominal aorta is covered by the greater omentum anteriorly,The ascending (fourth) part of the duodenum lies on the right side of the abdominal aorta,The common hepatic duct lies along the free edge of the greater omentum,The portal vein is formed by the union of the superior mesenteric vein and the splenic vein,The right branch of the hepatic artery passes in front of the common hepatic duct,D,"The abdominal aorta is covered anteriorly by the lesser omentum and stomach, behind which are the branches of the coeliac artery and the coeliac plexus. Posteriorly the aorta is separated from the lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral fibrocartilages by the anterior longitudinal ligament and left lumbar veins. The ascending (fourth) part of the duodenum, along with the left crus of diaphragm, the left coeliac ganglion and some coils of the small intestine, lies to the left of the abdominal aorta. The portal vein is the upward continuation of the superior mesenteric vein, which changes its name to portal after it has received the splenic vein behind the neck of the pancreas. The right and the left hepatic ducts emerge from the porta hepatis and unite to form the common hepatic duct. It lies in the free edge of the lesser omentum, in front of the right edge of the portal vein and with the hepatic artery on its left. The right branch of the hepatic artery normally passes behind the common hepatic duct."
basic medicine,475,Which of the following statements regarding blood groups and blood products is true?,Normal oxygen affinity is restored within 6‐12 hours of transfusion,"Group A, rhesus negative is the universal donor blood",The ABO system is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern,The volume of a unit of packed cells is 350 +/− 20 ml,Stored whole blood contains the normal concentration of clotting factors,A,"RBCs that have been separated from the liquid plasma (packed RBCs) should be administered to patients who have anaemia or who have blood loss. In stored whole blood factors V and VIII are reduced after two days.The universal donors blood is blood group O. The universal recipient is blood group AB.Red blood cells (RBCs) are the blood component most frequently used for transfusion. Stored blood, sometimes called packed cells, are concentrated red cells with a PVC of between 0.55 and 0.75. Most units are supplied in SAG‐M (optimal additive solution). This allows removal of all the plasma for other uses. The volume of a unit of concentrated cells is 280 +/− 20 ml (haematocrit 70‐80%).A transfusion of RBCs increases the amount of oxygen that can be carried to the tissues of the body. The level of 2,3‐DPG is reduced after 7 days of storage and absent after 10 days. The consequent increased oxygen affinity and reduced release of oxygen returns to normal within hours of transfusion.There is a single ABO gene with three alleles. A and B are codominant so it is a variant of autosomal dominant inheritance."
basic medicine,476,Which of the following is the mechanism of action of Ivabradine?,L-Type calcium channel blocker,Beta blocker,Alpha blocker,If channel inhibitor,Sodium channel blocker,D,"Ivabradine is a novel agent which blocks the If channel in the sinoatrial node, resulting in a reduced heart rate. It is used as an anti-anginal agent as a second-line alternative to the rate-slowing calcium-channel blockers verapamil and diltiazem.  L-Type calcium channels are found in the cardiac muscle cells as well as skeletal and smooth muscle cells, and are blocked by verapamil and diltiazem.   Labetalol and atenolol are both beta blockers which can be used in the treatment of angina.   Sodium channel blockers, such as flecainide, are anti-arrhythmics which can be used in the treatment of tacchyarrhythmias such as AF.   Alpha blockers, such as doxazosin, are mainly used to treat hypertension but can also be used in the management of lower urinary tract symptoms.  "
basic medicine,477,Piezoelectric crystal resonance is used in what imaging modality?,CAT scan,MRI,PET,Ultrasound,X-ray,D,"A voltage is applied to Piezoelectric crystals to generate ultrasound waves. Imaging MRIUtilises a strong magnetic field that causes protons to align with the field Radiofrequency is then applied to disrupt the proton alignment. When the radio frequency is stopped the protons return to their axis of equilibrium but release energy in the process. This energy release is detected by the scanner Non-ionisingCTUtilises Multiple X-Rays that are then analysed by computer and create 3D images. Potential for high dose of ionisng radiation A CT abdomen is equivalent to 400 chest X-rays or 2.7 years background radiationPETPET CT uses a radioactive tracer, usually fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), an analogue of glucose.

basic medicine,479,A 68‐year‐old woman admitted for a total hip replacement develops signs of a urinary tract infection on the third post operative day. Microscopy confirms the presence of Escherichia coli. Which of the following antibiotics has the lowest expected effectiveness for this nosocomial acquired infection?,Gentamicin,Ciprofloxacin,Cefuroxime,Ampicillin,Co‐amoxiclav,D,"Escherichia coli is a Gram negative bacillus which produces penicillinases, but it remains sensitive to numerous antibiotics.Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a major problem and where possible sensitivities should be checked before blind treatment of infections is commenced.Ampicillin (and amoxicillin) are broad spectrum antibiotics active against non‐beta lactamase producing Gram positive and Gram negative organisms. They are inactivated by penicillinases. Since up to 50% of Escherichia coli strains are now resistant they have the lowest expected effectiveness in this list.Cefuroxime is a cephalosporin that is resistant to inactivation by bacterial beta‐lactamases and so may be used against Escherichia coli.Ciprofloxacin has a 6‐fluoro substituent which confers enhanced antibacterial potency against both Gram positive and Gram negative organisms, including Escherichia coli. Co‐amoxiclav consists of amoxicillin and the beta‐lactamase inhibitor clavulanic acid. Thus it is active against beta‐lactamase producing bacteria that are resistant to amoxicillin, including strains of Escherichia coli.Gentamicin is an aminoglycoside which works by binding to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit this inhibits the translocation of the peptidyl‐tRNA from the A‐site to the P‐site and also causes misreading of mRNA, leaving the bacterium unable to synthesise proteins vital to its growth."

Which of the following options is NOT appropriate?,Liquid nitrogen cryotherapy,Trichloracetic acid,Podophylline paint,Imiquimod 5% cream,LASER treatement,C,"All of the above are appropriate treatment options in the non-pregnant patient. Podophylline is considered potentially teratogenic and shouldn't be used.5-fluorouracil although not listed would also be inappropriate for the same reason. The other options are safe to use during pregnancy (although Imiquimod is not licensed for use in pregnancy). Non treatment is also a safe option. HPV Gardasil® is a quadrivalent vaccine against HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18HPV types16 and 18 are responsible for 70% of cases of HPV related cancers. They are considered the most important high risk genotypes of HPV. As well as cervical cancer they are associated with cancers of the oropharynx and anogenital region. There are over 100 genotypes of HPV including several other high risk HPV types. HPV is thought to induce cancer via onco-proteins. The primary onco-proteins are E6 and E7 which inactivate two tumor suppressor proteins, p53 (inactivated by E6) and pRb (inactivated by E7)HPV genotypes 6 and 11 are low risk and cause anogenital warts. Typically 70% of HPV infections are cleared within 1 year and 90% are cleared within 2 years"

It contains cells from both the fourth and fifth pharyngeal pouches (ultimobranchial bodies). The arteries to the thyroid gland are the superior thyroid artery, the inferior thyroid artery, and sometimes the thyroid ima. The thyroid is surrounded by a sheath derived from the pretracheal layer of deep fascia. The sheath attaches the gland to the larynx and the trachea. They ascend laterally."
basic medicine,485,Which of the following is correct concerning cerebrospinal fluid?,Containing blood increases reabsorption,Is produced at approximately 300 ml/hr by the choroid plexus,Is reabsorbed by arachnoid granulations in the superior sagital sinus,Lies in the subdural space,Proceeds from the lateral ventricles via the foramen of Monro into the fourth ventricle,C,"Cerebrospinal fluid is produced at a rate of approximately 30 ml/hr by the choroid plexus which is primarily located in the lateral ventricles. It then passes from the lateral ventricles via the foramen of Monro to the third ventricle and then the aqueduct of sylvius into the fourth ventricle. On leaving the ventricular system it enters the subarachnoid space, overlying the brain and spinal cord. The arachnoid granulations in the superior sagital sinus reabsorb it back into the venous circulation. Plugging of these granulations impairs reabsorption raising intra cranial pressure, causing communicating hydrocephalus."

The odontoid peg articulates with the back of the anterior arch of the atlas and is held in position by the transverse ligament of the atlas. The median atlanto-axial joint is where the odontoid peg articulates with the back of the anterior arch of the atlas; this is a synovial pivot joint between the odontoid peg and a ring formed by the anterior arch and the transverse ligament (cruciform ligament) of the atlas. Between the two is a relatively large bursa. In addition to the joints, certain accessory ligaments (tectorial membrane, cruciform ligament, apical and alar ligaments) connect the axis to the occiput, bypassing the atlas."
basic medicine,488,Which muscle of the lower limb is primarily responsible for hip flexion?,Peroneus longus,Extensor hallucis longus,Tibialis anterior,Iliopsoas,Quadriceps,D,"The iliopsoas consists of two closely related muscles, the iliacus and psoas major. The iliacus arises from the iliac fossa on the interior side of the hip bone, and also from the region of the anterior inferior iliac spine (AIIS).The psoas major is divided into a superficial and deep part. The deep part originates from the transverse processes of lumbar vertebrae I‐V. The superficial part originates from the lateral surfaces of the last thoracic vertebra, lumbar vertebrae I‐IV, and from neighbouring invertebral discs.The iliopsoas contributes to flexion and external rotation in the hip joint and is important for standing, walking, and running. It is the strongest of the hip flexors (others are rectus femoris, sartorius, and tensor fasciae latae)."
basic medicine,489,In which of the following cases of lung cancer would surgical resection of the tumour be a reasonable therapeutic option?,A 56-year-old woman with an adenocarcinoma of the right lung. CT scan shows enlarged lymph nodes in the right and left hilum. PFTs show an FEV1 of 2.25 L. (55% predicted).,A 59-year-old man who is found at bronchoscopy to have a tumour in the right mainstem bronchus extending to within 1 cm of the carina. Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) show an FEV1 of 2.1 litres (65% of predicted normal).,A 62-year-old lady with a small peripheral mass who has elevated liver enzymes and a computed tomography (CT) scan showing probable metastatic deposits in the liver. Lung function tests show an FEV1 of 3.5 litres (80% of predicted normal).,A 70-year-old man with a right lower lobe tumour 2 cm in diameter with no evidence of regional adenopathy or distant spread of disease. Lung funcion studies show an FEV1 of 0.8 litres (28% predicted).,A 71-year-old man with a 3 cm tumour obstructing the right lower lobe bronchus. Lung function tests show an FEV1 of 2.1 L. (60% predicted).,E,Surgical resection of a lung tumour may be expected to have increased success with limitation of disease spread. In the first case with hilar LAP and reduced lung function surgery would be futile. In the second case the tumour is too close to the bifurcation of the bronchi to permit resection. The third case has metastatic disease and would clearly be unsuitable for surgery. Generally a positron emission tomography (PET) scan would confirm this. The fourth case has a tumour that would be potentially resectable but lung function is too poor. The final case has a tumour that would be suitable for resection and has good lung function.
basic medicine,490,A 62-year-old man is found to have squamous cell carcinoma of the lung after being investigated for haemoptysis. Which one of the following would be a contraindication to surgical resection?,Finger clubbing,Hypercalcaemia ,Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy,Pleural effusion,Superior vena cava obstruction,E,"Superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO) interrupts venous return from the head, arms and thorax to the right atrium resulting in facial swelling, stridor, cough, breathlessness, hoarseness, headache, etc. It was first described by William Hunter in 1757 in a case of syphilitic aortic aneurysm but these days the commonest cause is malignancy and in particular bronchial carcinoma and lymphoma. Treatment is of the underlying condition, chemotherapy for small cell lung cancer and lymphoma and radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Sometimes patients require stenting of the SVCO for symptomatic relief prior to more definitive treatment. Pleural effusions are a contraindication to surgery if they are malignant but effusions in patients with squamous cell carcinoma may be reactive. Absolute contraindications for surgery include:  Patient refusal Metastases.  Relative contraindications include:  Cell type: small cell carcinoma are usually inoperable Poor respiratory reserve - FEV1 greater than 1.2l is necessary for lobectomy, and greater than 1.8l for pneumonectomy Raised PaCO2 is a contraindication for surgery Other disease - especially myocardial Mediastinal involvement Age - in patients over 70, surgery is usually inadvisable because the benefits are outweighed by operative morbidity and mortality."
basic medicine,491,An asymptomatic 56-year-old man with a family history of type 2 diabetes is found to have a fasting venous glucose of 6.5 mmol/L (normal range 3.0-6.0 mmol/l). Which statement is correct?,He has impaired glucose tolerance,He should be investigated further by another fasting venous sampling,He should be treated with oral hypoglycaemics in the first instance,He should undergo a 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test,This does not need further investigation,D,"According to the World Health Organization criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes, a fasting venous plasma glucose (VPG) of 6.1-6.9 is categorised as impaired fasting hyperglycaemia (IFG). This level requires further assessment with a 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) which is still the gold standard. A two hour value of equal to or over 11.1 mmol/L is diagnostic of diabetes. Impaired glucose tolerance is a two hour VPG of 7.8-11.1 during an OGT. Initial treatment of type 2 diabetes is patient education, diet and lifestyle changes. "
basic medicine,492,Which one of the following is true of acute otitis media?,Is infrequently preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection,Severe pain followed by a very sudden improvement in symptoms is a good prognostic sign,Should be treated with grommet insertion,The handle and short process of the malleus often appears less prominent,The tympanic membrane appears congested and bulging,E,"The bacteria involved in an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) can track up the eustachian tubes to cause an infection in the middle ear. Initially the tympanic membrane usually becomes retracted making the handle and short process of the malleus more prominent. As pressure builds up in the middle ear the ear drum may become distended and bulge outwards. This sign is usually accompanied by severe otalgia and systemic toxicity and fever and tachycardia. Severe pain followed by a very sudden improvement is not a good prognostic sign. It suggests that the tympanic membrane has perforated. The severe pain (often associated with systemic symptoms) is mainly caused by raised pressure within the middle ear. If the tympanic membrane ruptures the pressures will equalise and the pain will fall dramatically. Treatment does involve broad spectrum antibiotics (to cover Haemophilus and Streptococci), bed rest and analgesia. However, initial treatment certainly does not involve grommet insertion. Grommets should be considered only if there is a persistent middle ear effusion or recurrent attacks of acute otitis media."
basic medicine,493,"During pregnancy, which of the following lung function values is unchanged?",FRC,Tidal Volume,ERV,FEV1,TLC,D,"(Forced expiratory volume)FEV1/FVC ratio remains the same in pregnancy, FEV1 and FVC are unchanged.Lung volumes changes during typical pregnancy:Oxygen Consumption increases by approximately 20% Total lung capacity reduced by approximately 5%. Expiratory Reserve Volume reduced by approximately 20% Tidal volume is increased by approximately 50%. Functional residual capacity reduced by term by approximately 20%. Uterine enlargement displaces the diaphragm upwards by up to 4cm Gravid uterus enlargement limits the movement of the thoracic cage causing shortness of breath. Minute ventilation increase by about 50% during 1st trimester. pH remains normal or increases slightly due to renal compensation: HCO3- decreases FEV1 and FVC remain the same. PCO2 decreases. PO2 increases.Progesterone Progesterone gradually increases during the course of pregnancy, from 25 ng⋅mL−1 at 6 weeks’ to 150 ng⋅mL−1 at 37 weeks’ gestation. Progesterone acts as trigger of the primary respiratory center by increasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide, as indicated by the steeper slope of the ventilation curve in response to alveolar carbon dioxide changes. Progesterone alters the smooth muscle tone of the airways resulting in a bronchodilator effect. It also mediates hyperaemia and oedema of mucosal surfaces, causing nasal congestion.Oestrogen The circulating levels of oestrogen increase during pregnancy, before or in parallel to those of progesterone. Oestrogen is a mediator of progesterone receptors. It increases the number and the sensitivity of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla, the central neuronal respiratory-related areas.Prostaglandins Prostaglandins stimulate uterine smooth muscle during labour and are present during all three trimesters of pregnancy. Prostaglandin F2α increases airway resistance by bronchial smooth muscle constriction, whereas a bronchodilator effect can be a consequence of prostaglandins E1 and E2."

Her brother must have inherited both of the affected genes. She has a 2 in 3 chance of being a carrier. If her and her partners are carriers then there would be a 1 in 4 chance of the child being affected. You multiply the the probabilities to get 2 over 1200, therefore 1 in 600."
basic medicine,496,A 38-year-old woman has undergone thyoidectomy for a suspicious nodule. Histology confirmed a papillary carcinoma of the thyroid gland. Which of the following is true of papillary thyroid carcinoma?,Has a good response to chemotherapy,Has a worse prognosis than follicular carcinoma,Is associated with hypocalcaemia in 20% of cases,Is the third most common cause of thyroid malignancy,Thyroglobulin is a sensitive marker for recurrence,E,"Thyroglobulin is a very sensitive marker for recurrence. After total thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation, serum thyroglobulin levels should be less than2 ng/L. There are four types of thyroid malignancy:  papillary follicular medullary, and anaplastic.  Papillary carcinoma is the commonest malignancy:  80% of cases average age 40 10-year survival 80%. histology: complex branching fronds of cells slow lymphatic spread, and treated with surgery/^131I.  It has a better prognosis than follicular carcinoma but has a poor response to chemotherapy. Adriamycin has been tried without much success.

Hyperchloraemic acidosis would be associated with a normal or reduced anion gap. Hyperparathyroidism is associated with this disorder. A pancreatic fistula is associated with bicarbonate losses."
basic medicine,499,Which of the following is correct concerning bacterial capsules?,Are associated with endotoxic shock,Are typical of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Can transfer antibiotic resistance to other bacteria,Enhance bacterial resistance to dehydration and phagocytosis,Reduce bacterial resistance to antibiotics,D,"Bacterial capsules are usually composed of polysaccharide, and they may be associated with mucoid colonial morphology. The slimy material functions as an anti-phagocytic agent, and also protects the bacterial cell from the environment (e.g. from dehydration, and antibiotics which may be present). However, many important bacterial pathogens do not rely on capsules (e.g. M. tuberculosis). Endotoxic shock is associated with the biological activity of Gram negative cell wall lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and not capsules. Capsulated bacteria include Strep. pneumoniae and Pseudomonas. Although capsules may help to protect against antibiotics, they do not transfer antibiotic resistance."
basic medicine,500,Which of the following is true of the side effects of vancomycin?,Are not seen if the drug is given orally,Includes irreversible vestibular damage,Are liable to occur with chronic liver disease,Includes liver failure,Are unusual in the elderly,B,"Tinnitus is usually the first manifestation of vancomycin ototoxicity. Irreversible vestibular damage can result from the ototoxicity.Vancomycin is excreted renally. Liver impairment does not affect its elimination from the body.Side effects are more common in elderly patients, due to the reduced volumes of distribution and reduced renal reserve.Auditory and renal function should be monitored regularly in the elderly. A reduced dose should be used, if there is renal imapairment.Oral vancomycin is not normally significantly absorbed systemically. However, after multiple doses or in inflammatory bowel disease, absorption can cause systemic side effects."
basic medicine,501,A woman in the outpatient clinic tells you that she has been diagnosed with Trichomonas vaginalis. What kind of organism is Trichomonas vaginalis?,Intracellular diplococcus,Yeast,Pox virus,Flagellated protozoan,Phthiriasis,D,"Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan which is best diagnosed when a swab is used to sample the fluid in the posterior fornix of the vagina and examined on a slide using a microscope as a ""wet prep"". Women typically present with a malodorous ""frothy"" discharge.Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan, thus whilst intracellular diplococcus, phthiriasis and pox virus describe other types of sexually transmitted infections, only flagellated protozoan correctly categorises Trichomonas vaginalis.Examples of the other options include:Phthiriasis or Phthirus pubis describes pubic lice, which can be diagnosed with the naked eye in the pubic hair. Appropriate treatment includes malathion lotion and permethrin cream (unlicensed). All extra‐genital body hair should also be treated and all bedding should be washed at a high temperature. Sexual partners should also be notified and treated.Candida albicans is yeast which may be identified by culture or by the presence of hyphae, pseudohyphae and spores on microscopy. Current evidence does not suggest that candida is sexually transmitted.Neisseria gonorrhoea is a Gram negative intracellular diplococcus. Molluscum contagiosum is a pox virus which is transmitted by skin‐to‐skin contact and often presents with umbilicated smooth papules in the genital region."

Its extrapyramidal side-effects can be treated with procyclidine which has antimuscarinic properties. Metoclopramide is relatively free of side-effects, apart from tardive dyskinesia and oculogyric crises (extrapyramidal effects) and drowsiness. The extra-pyramidal symptoms are more frequent in children and young adults (15-19). These side effects may continue long after the drug is discontinued. Treatment is not recommended for longer than 12 weeks (FDA) The peripheral effects of metoclopramide inhibiting the action of dopamine are illustrated by its enhancement of antral and fundal contractility and relaxation of the pylorus. The net effect is to increase the rate of gastric emptying. The lower oesophageal sphincter pressure is, however, increased and this leads to an increase in barrier pressure."

basic medicine,520,Which of the following is true of glycosylated haemoglobin?,Is absent in the plasma of people without diabetes mellitus,Is increased in diabetic patient with concurrent sickle cell disease,Results from the combination of a haemoglobin A and sugar moiety,The levels of HbA1c are a poor index of glucose-induced renal dysfunction in diabetics,When measured as HbA1c in plasma gives a more accurate retrospective estimates of blood sugar levels than other glycosylated products,C,"Glycosylated haemoglobin is found in the normal population but the percentage is lower than in patients with diabetes. The risk of renal damage such as microalbuminuria increases when HbA1c exceeds 8%. The level of HbA1c reflects or integrates the blood sugar concentration over the previous c.115 days, the mean lifetime of the red blood cell. Glycosylated haemoglobin is formed through the non-enzymatic binding of a hexose to the N-terminal amino acid of the beta-chain. Patients with sickle cell disease and haemolytic diseases have decreased survival span of red blood cells and therefore glycosylation is reduced. Glycosylated serum proteins such as fructosamine (albumin) may be more accurate than glycosylated haemoglobin for the retrospective estimation of blood sugar levels. It is useful where the HBA1c levels show a discrepancy with blood sugar levels. Fructosamine reflects blood sugar levels over around 30 days, the half-life of albumin. Fructosamine levels are unaffected by red blood cell disorders. Frucosamine levels are underutilised in clinical practice."

Which medication is likely to be causing this problem?",Diltiazem,Eplerenone,Isosorbide mononitrate,Nicorandil,Propranolol,A,"Diltiazem, as with nearly all the calcium channel blockers, causes gravitational/ankle oedema. Eplerenone is an aldosterone antagonist and therefore is used to treat ankle oedema.  Isosorbide mononitrate commonly causes headaches and hypotension. Nicorandil rarely causes angioedema, but not ankle swelling. Propranolol does not cause ankle oedema although it may worsen decompensated heart failure, so is usually avoided until the patient has been diuresed appropriately."
basic medicine,538,With respect to the changes in the fetal circulation at the time of birth,Pulmonary artery resistance rises rapidly,There is a decrease in PaO2 and an increase in PaCO2,The pressure in the left atrium falls,Rise in PaO2 initiates constriction of the umbilical arteries,The pressure in the right atrium increases,D,"Changes at birth∙ Pulmonary arteriolar resistance falls rapidly due to vasodilation caused by lung expansion, increasedPao2, and reduced Paco2∙ Expansion of the chest wall also reduces pulmonary interstitial pressure, increasing blood flowthrough pulmonary capillaries∙ Air breathing increases the Pao2, which constricts the umbilical arteries∙ Increased venous return from the lungs raises left atrial pressure while venous return from the placenta isreduced and eventually stops, reducing right atrial pressure. The net result is a reduction in the pressuregradient between left and right atria and functional closure of the foramen ovale∙ Systemic resistance becomes higher than pulmonary resistance soon after birth and the direction of bloodflow through the ductus arteriosus reverses, creating left-to-right shunting (transitional circulation). Thisis established moments after birth and lasts until about 24 to 72 h of age, when the ductus arteriosuscloses.∙ High PO2 in blood entering the ductus from the aorta and alterations in prostaglandin metabolism, leadsto constriction and closure of the ductus arteriosus∙ Soon after birth, a stressed neonate may revert to a fetal-type circulation due to hypoxia and hypercarbia.This causes the pulmonary arterioles to constrict and the ductus arteriosus to dilate, reversing theprocesses that resulted in functional closure of the ductus. The foramen ovale also re-opens.∙ The neonate becomes severely hypoxemic (persistent pulmonary hypertension or persistent fetalcirculation)"

basic medicine,568,"A 21-year-old nurse comes to the clinic requesting contraception. She works shifts including nights, and so often wakes up at odd times of the day. She has recently married and may want to start a family during the next two years. Her mother suffered a DVT three years ago, aged 50. On further questioning she has some problems with libido and has heard that progesterone only based preparations may impact on this. On examination she looks well, her BMI is 21 kg/m^2, and her BP is 100/70 mmHg. Which of the following is likely to be the most appropriate medication for her?",Combined oral contraceptive pill,Diaphragm,Mirena coil,Progesterone implant,Progesterone only pill,A,"The fact that her mother was older than 45 when she had her DVT means this is less relevant when assessing this lady's VTE risk with the combined pill. For the progesterone only pill, it must be taken within three hours of the time the pill was taken on the previous day; given she works shifts this is likely to have a significant impact and increase the chances of a missed pill. The time window for a missed pill with respect to the combined pill is 12 hours. Given that she may decide to start a family at any time, the progesterone implant or Mirena coil do not seem to be ideal options, and progesterone only preparations may be associated with a reduced libido. The diaphragm has a higher failure rate and should definitely not be the first choice in this patient. The primary action of the combined oral contraceptive pill is inhibition of ovulation, although there are also alterations to the cervical mucus and endometrium which may contribute to effectiveness. In contrast the progesterone only pill does not necessarily affect ovulation and its primary mode of action is on cervical mucus and implantation. Long acting progesterone preparations prevent proliferation of the endometrium, thicken cervical mucus and suppress ovulation in some women. The major risk of the combined oral contraceptive pill is thromboembolic disease; with respect to long acting progesterone, the major concerns are around irregular menstrual bleeding and changes in libido.

basic medicine,578,Regarding melanoma,Melanocytes are derived from neural crest,Melanin is derived from tryptophan,Most commonly a benign tumor,More common in males,Malignant cells can't cross placenta,A,"MELANOMA Melanoma is a cancer that begins in the melanocytes. Other names for this cancer include malignant melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. Most melanoma cells still make melanin, so melanoma tumors are usually brown or black. But some melanomas do not make melanin and can appear pink, tan, or even white. Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but they are more likely to start on the trunk (chest and back) in men and on the legs in women. The neck and face are other common sites. Having darkly pigmented skin lowers your risk of melanoma at these more common sites, but anyone can get melanoma on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Melanomas in these areas make up a much larger portion of melanomas in African Americans than in whites. Melanomas can also form in other parts of your body, such as the eyes, mouth, genitals, and anal area, but these are much less common than melanoma of the skin. Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancer. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.

basic medicine,583,A patient is to undergo radiotherapy for locally advanced cervical carcinoma. What is the typical daily dose (fraction) of radiotherapy?,0.1 Gy,0.5 Gy,1.0 Gy,2.0 Gy,5.0 Gy,D,Daily doses of radiotherapy for cervical cancer is 1.8-2.0 Gy. The fraction dose is typical for most gynaecological cancers amenable to radiotherapy regardless of stage Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Key PointsIonizing radiation Causes DNA damage leading to cellular death DNA damage caused by ionisation leading to free radical formation Can be locally placed i.e Brachythrapy or external beam To reduce damage to normal tissue shaped and multiple beams are used with a higher absorbed dose at the point of convergence Radiosensitizers increase the effect of a given dose of radiation Radiosensitisers fall into 4 main groups:1. Oxygen2. Hypoxic cell sensitizers3. Halogenated Pyrimidines4. Bioreductive AgentsRadioprotectors are agents that reduce the effects of radiation. Their role is limited in clinical practice due to possible protection of tumours Radiotherapy dosing is in Gray (Gy). Total dose varies between tumour type and stage but typical regimes involve 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions delivered over a number of weeks with total dose accumulating to reach around 50 Gy (a comprehensive list can be found using the link on the right but is likely beyond the scope of the MRCOG exam)
basic medicine,584,"A 76-year-old man is reviewed in clinic having recently been diagnosed with severe heart failure (HF) associated with very limiting breathlessness. He was formerly a heavy smoker with a medical history of COPD. His lung function test demonstrates mild to moderate obstructive airways disease and he has 5% airways reversibility. On clinical examination his heart rate is 95 bpm and BP 156/90 mmHg. No wheeze is present. He has an elevated JVP +5 cms but no clinical signs of fluid congestion. He is already taking aspirin 75 mg od, ramipril 10 mg od, furosemide 40 mg od and simvastatin 40 mg nocte. You decide to add in a beta blocker as the next step. Which would be the most appropriate choice?  ",Atenolol 25 mg od,Bisoprolol 5 mg od,Bisoprolol 1.25 mg od,Carvedilol 6.25 mg bd,Carvedilol 12.5 mg bd,C,"NICE recommends β blockers in all HF patients. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with HF, cardioselective β blockers appear safer at lower doses than higher doses or non-selective β blockers (refs in DTB article). Bisoprolol 5 mgs is too high an initial starting dose, a low dose can always be titrated up later, if tolerated. Carvedilol though effective treatment for heart failure is not selective and therefore carries a greater risk of causing bronchospasm. Atenolol though cardioselective has no clinical evidence for prognostic benefit in heart failure. The patient should be closely monitored for deterioration in lung function post-administration."
basic medicine,585,Which of the following is correct in blood pressure regulation?,Adrenaline acts primarily on the vasomotor centre,Angiotensinogen is inactive without modification,Bradykinin increases blood pressure,Prostacyclin raises blood pressure,Serotonin is a vasodilator,B,"Circulating hormones such as adrenaline and angiotensin II (which is converted from angiotensin I, which itself is converted from angiotensinogen via the renin-ACE conversion pathway) are potent vasoconstrictors, but they probably have little effect on acute cardiovascular control. In contrast, endothelium-derived factors play an important role in controlling local blood flow. These substances are either produced or modified in the vascular endothelium, and include prostacyclin and nitric oxide, both potent vasodilators. Bradykinin is known to be vasodilatory and hence has a hypotensive effect. Serotonin causes vasoconstriction, which is why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) can cause hypotension as a side effect."
basic medicine,586,Which of the following is true regarding the blood supply to the brain?,The internal carotid arteries divide into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries,The internal carotid arteries provide one third of the blood supply,The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the anterior cerebral artery,The posterior cerebral arteries are branches of the vertebral arteries,The posterior communicating artery links the two posterior cerebral arteries,A,"The arterial blood supply to the brain is provided by the two internal carotid arteries (two thirds of the blood supply) and the two vertebral arteries (one third of the blood supply). The internal carotid artery divides into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, which supply the anterior two thirds of the cerebral hemispheres. The ophthalmic artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery (not anterior cerebral artery). The vertebral arteries unite to form the basilar artery, which supplies the brain stem and cerebellum. The basilar artery then divides into the two posterior cerebral arteries, which supply the posterior one third of the cerebral hemispheres. The andquot;Circle of Willisandquot; is formed by anastomoses linking the carotid arterial system to the vertebrobasilar system. The anterior communicating artery links the anterior cerebral arteries, and the posterior communicating arteries link the vertebrobasilar system to the carotid system. This provides a collateral blood supply, should one or more of the four extracranial arteries supplying the brain become diseased."

basic medicine,637,Which of the following is true regarding acute pain management?,Codeine should not be given orally,Entonox contains 30% oxygen and 70% nitrous oxide,Ketamine causes a dry mouth,The dose of intravenous morphine is 10 mg,The half life of naloxone is shorter than the half life of morphine,E,"Intravenous morphine is the gold standard opiate analgesic, against which the potency of other drugs is compared. The dose of intravenous morphine is 0.1-0.2 mg/kg. It is an agonist at the various opioids' receptors and its actions are antagonised by naloxone (especially pain and respiratory depression). However, the half life of naloxone is shorter than the half life of the metabolites of morphine and this should be remembered when treating an opioids overdose. Entonox is a gaseous mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide in equal proportions (50:50). It provides moderate analgesia but the effects are short-lived and its use is contraindicated in patients with pulmonary disease. Codeine is unlicensed for intravenous use and should only be given intramuscularly, orally or rectally. Ketamine increases salivation and pretreatment with an anti-sialogogue such as glycopyrrolate is useful."

basic medicine,642,"Due to which of the following, Minute ventilation in pregnancy increases?",Effects of gravid uterus on diaphragm,Increased renal excretion of bicarbonate,Increased oestragen,Increased progesterone,Dliutional anaemia,D,"Increased circulating progesteroneIncreased minute ventilation wash off CO2 and as a result pCO2 is reduced. pH homeostasis is maintained by increased renal excretion of bicarbonate. This is due to the result of increased circulating progesterone. Progesteronedirectly stimulate ventilation by sensitizing the CNS respiratory centers to CO2Lung volumes changes during typical pregnancy:Oxygen Consumption increases by approximately 20% Total lung capacity reduced by approximately 5%. Expiratory Reserve Volume reduced by approximately 20% Tidal volume is increased by approximately 50%. Functional residual capacity reduced by term by approximately 20%. Uterine enlargement displaces the diaphragm upwards by up to 4cm Gravid uterus enlargement limits the movement of the thoracic cage causing shortness of breath. Minute ventilation increase by about 50% during 1st trimester. pH remains normal or increases slightly due to renal compensation: HCO3- decreases FEV1 and FVC remain the same. PCO2 decreases. PO2 increases.Progesterone Progesterone gradually increases during the course of pregnancy, from 25 ng⋅mL−1 at 6 weeks’ to 150 ng⋅mL−1 at 37 weeks’ gestation. Progesterone acts as trigger of the primary respiratory center by increasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide, as indicated by the steeper slope of the ventilation curve in response to alveolar carbon dioxide changes. Progesterone alters the smooth muscle tone of the airways resulting in a bronchodilator effect. It also mediates hyperaemia and oedema of mucosal surfaces, causing nasal congestion.Oestrogen The circulating levels of oestrogen increase during pregnancy, before or in parallel to those of progesterone. Oestrogen is a mediator of progesterone receptors. It increases the number and the sensitivity of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla, the central neuronal respiratory-related areas.Prostaglandins Prostaglandins stimulate uterine smooth muscle during labour and are present during all three trimesters of pregnancy. Prostaglandin F2α increases airway resistance by bronchial smooth muscle constriction, whereas a bronchodilator effect can be a consequence of prostaglandins E1 and E2."

Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",Benzodiazepine overdose,Carbamazepine toxicity,Lithium toxicity,Neuroleptic malignant syndrome,Tricyclic overdose,C,"The tremor, seizure and confusion should raise the possibility of lithium toxicity which is the condition that best fits this clinical picture. Lithium toxicity occurs at levels above 1.4 mmol/L and can result in:  Anorexia Diarrhoea Vomiting Ataxia Nystagmus Dysarthria Confusion, and Seizures.  In therapeutic range it can be associated with a fine tremor, which can become coarser in toxicity. If allowed to progress, toxicity will result in coma with hyperreflexia and increased tone. Neurological damage can be irreversible. AV block can also occur, commonly first degree but complete heart block is also seen. Generally, treatment is supportive and attention must be paid to electrolytes, fluid balance, renal function and seizure control. Toxbase should be consulted, as bowel irrigation can be used in significant recent overdose. Diuretics should be avoided. Haemodialysis may be required, and benzodiazepines can control agitation. Benzodiazepine overdose presents with:  Somnolence Diplopia Ataxia Impaired motor function Anterograde amnesia Delirium Aggression Hallucinations Nausea and Vomiting.  In severe overdose there can be:  Coma Apnoea Hypothermia Hypotension Bradycardiac and Cardiac arrest.  Carbamazine overdose presents with:  Drowsiness Slurred speech Ataxia Hallucinations Nausea Vomiting Tremor Blurred vision Seizures Oliguria, and Bullous skin lesions.  The presence of nystagmus and hyperreflexia in this case make lithium more likely (but they do share a number of features in toxicity). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome results in rigidity, fever, autonomic instablity, delirium and elevated plasma creatinine phosphokinase. Tricyclic antidepressants are very toxic in overdose and result in:  Tachycardia Somnolence Dry mouth Nausea and vomiting Urinary retention Confusion Agitation, and Headache.  Severe cases result in hypotension, dysrhythmias (sinus tachycardia, QT prolongation, widening of the QRS), hallucinations and seizures. "
basic medicine,656,Which of the following is a double stranded RNA virus?,Parvovirus B19,EBV,CMV,Rotavirus,Herpes Simplex type 2,D,"As can be seen from the table RNA viruses are almost always single stranded whilst DNA viruses are almost always double stranded. The exceptions are rotavirus and Parvovirus B19 respectively. Viruses There are a number of classification systems for Viruses with the ICTV and Baltimore systems often used. They are often simply classified according to the genetic material they are composed of i.e. RNA or DNA. They can then be further sub classified as single or double stranded and also according to their polarity i.e. positive or negative sense. The table below summarises the common clinically relevant viruses. Note HIV has been included as an RNA virus as it is made of RNA. It is a retrovirus however and uses DNA during replication. Because of this some systems would class the retroviruses outside of the RNA virus class.RNA VirusDNA VirusSingle stranded Double stranded Single stranded Double strandedHepatitis A,C,D,EHepatitis BRubellaCMVHIVVZVHerpes Simplex 1 and 2Human Papilloma VirusEpstein-BarrRotavirus Parvovirus B19"
basic medicine,657,A man has had diarrhoea for 3 weeks following cholecystectomy. What is the likely cause?,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Lactose intolerance,Bile acid malabsorption,Streptococcus viridans,Staphylococcus aureus,C,"Bile acid malabsorption can cause chronic diarrhoea as the large intestine will secrete a lot of fluid and increase its motility in the presence of bile acids. The ileum absorbs the majority of bile acids and ileal inflammation or resection will result in malabsorption. Cholecystectomy, vagotomy or any other gastrointestinal disease can also result in malabsorption. It is suspected that 1% of the population has idiopathic bile acid malabsorption. Diagnosis is made with SeHCAT testing, in which radiolabelled bile is given and the amount retained is calculated. A low level of retention means you have malabsorption. Treatment is with bile acid sequestrants which bind to bile, preventing its action and causes it to be excreted."

What blood picture would be expected on examination of the peripheral blood film?,Acanthocytes,Auer's bodies,Eliptocytosis,Howell-Jolly bodies,Microcytosis,D,"Howell-Jolly bodies are red blood cells with visible nuclear remnants. Such cells are normally produced by the bone marrow but the nuclear remnants are removed by the spleen within the first few hours of entering the circulation. Splenectomy is associated with:  Howell-Jolly bodies Thrombocytosis Macrocytosis (persistence of larger red blood cells) Acanthocytes Target cells, and Leucocytosis.  Auer's bodies are inclusions in leukaemic white cells and are pathogonomic of leukaemia. Acanthocytes are associated with a rare neurodegenerative condition: neuroacanthocytosis."
basic medicine,699,What is the primary form of haemoglobin in a 7 week old foetus?,HbF,Hb Portland 1,HbS,Hb Gower 1,Hb Gower 2,D,"The first 10-12 weeks of fetal development Embryonic Haemoglobin (HbE) :It is a tetramer consisting of Gower 1, Gower 2, Portland 1 and Portland 2. Of these four subtypes Gower 1is the primary form of haemoglobin. It is produced by the Yolk Sac from the 1st week of pregnancy until birth.After 10-12 weeks Fetal Haemoglobin (HbF) becomes the primary form and comprises 50-90% of haemoglobin at birth. It is almost completely replaced by adult haemoglobin by 6 months of age. Fetal hemoglobin (HbF) is the dominant form of hemoglobin present in the fetus during gestation. HbF is produced by erythroid precursor cells from 10 to 12 weeks of pregnancy through the first six months of postnatal life.Baby takes about 2 years to completely switch over to adult haemoglobinCompared to adult hemoglobin, it has a significantly higher affinity for oxygen and its oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (ODC) is left-shifted accordinglybefore 12 weeks Embryonic Hemoglobin is the primary form is mainly Hb Gower 1. After 12 weeks tillthe first six months of postnatal life the primary form is Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF)By 6 months of age Adult haemoglobin is primary form At birth composes 50-90% of haemoglobin Fetal hemoglobin is alkali-resistant hemoglobinThe four types of Embryonic HaemoglobinHaemoglobin Gower 1(ζ2ɛ2) Haemoglobin Gower 2(α2ɛ2) Haemoglobin Portland I(ζ2γ2) Haemoglobin Portland IIHb F increased in: Hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin.Sickle cell anemia.Acquired a plastic anemia.Megaloblastic anemia.Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobin."
basic medicine,700,Which of the following is correct with regard to the thumb and thenar eminence?,Dorsal cutaneous branch of ulnar nerve is given off in the upper third of the forearm,Opponens pollicis lies superficial to flexor pollicis brevis,Synovial sheath of flexor pollicis longus communicates with the radial bursa,The first metacarpal articulates with the trapezoid,There may be numbness over the thenar eminence as a result of carpal tunnel syndrome,C,The ulnar nerve enters the forearm by passing around the medial epicondyle. In the distal third of the forearm the palmar and posterior (dorsal) cutaneous branch is given off. Opponens pollicis lies deep to flexor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis brevis. The radial bursa is the synovial sheath of the flexor pollicis longus. It communicates with the ulnar bursa (synovial sheath of the profundus and superficialis tendons) at the level of the wrist in half of individuals. The trapezium articulates with the first metacarpal. The thenar muscles are supplied by the median nerve which passes deep to the flexor retinaculum and hence is compressed in carpal tunnel syndrome. The skin over the thenar eminence is supplied by the palmar branch of the median nerve. This enters the palm superficial to the retinaculum so is not affected by carpel tunnel syndrome.
basic medicine,701,Which of the following is true regarding the first rib?,The lower trunk of the brachial plexus lies behind the first rib,The scalenus medius muscle is attached to the scalene tubercle,The stellate ganglion lies anterior to its neck,The subclavian artery lies in front of the scalene tubercle,The under surface bears a groove for the subclavian vein,C,The lower trunk of the brachial plexus lies on the upper surface of the first rib (not behind). The scalene tubercle provides the insertion for the tendon of scalenus anterior (not medius). The stellate ganglion does lie anterior to the neck of the first rib. The upper surface of the first rib (in front of the scalene tubercle) bears a groove for the subclavian vein. The subclavian artery runs in a separate groove behind the scalene tubercle (not in front).

basic medicine,703,"A 48-year-old Afro-Caribbean male presents with gradual onset of exertional dyspnoea, non-productive cough, malaise, weight loss and polyarthralgia. Schirmer's test indicates a dry eye. Hand x ray shows punched out osteopenic lesions. Which of the following investigations is unlikely to be helpful in establishing the diagnosis of this condition?",Quantitative immunoglobulins,Serum calcium,Serum phosphate,Thallium scan,Urea and electrolytes,D,"This patient has sarcoidosis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition characterised by the formation of non-caseating granulomas at various sites of the body. It has a predilection for the lungs and thoracic cavity, but can affect almost any organ system which can make diagnosis difficult. Bloods can demonstrate a raised white cell count, eosinophilia, lymphopenia, anaemia, or raised ESR. Renal impairment is rare, but can occur where there is nephrocalcinosis and this should be monitored. Liver function tests may be deranged, and phosphate and alkaline phosphatase may be raised. Serum calcium is elevated in 10-15% of cases, and may be associated with hypercalciuria. Immunoglobulins are classically raised in active disease. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are elevated in around 60% of patients, and usually reduce in response to treatment. Chest radiograph is useful in staging sarcoidosis, and can show lymphadenopathy (classically hilar) and/or pulmonary infiltrates. High-resolution CT scanning can detect interstitial lung disease. Pulmonary function tests demonstrate a restrictive defect in severe cases. Bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy are not required in all cases, but can demonstrate increased lymphocytes and non-caseating granulomas respectively. Gallium scanning (radioactive 67Ga) can be used to detect inflammation in extrapulmonary sites. It classically shows a 'lambda' pattern. This should not be confused with a thallium scan (radioactive 201T1), which demonstrates areas of poor perfusion (primary used in cardiology). ECG can demonstrate rhythm disturbance, due to infiltration of the conducting system of the heart. Biopsy of lymph nodes or skin lesions will show non-caseating epithelioid granulomas. The Kveim test (where splenic material from a confirmed case of sarcoidosis is injected into the patient intradermally) is no longer used clinically due to the risk of transmitting infection (including CJD) and the delay in getting results."
basic medicine,704,"Which of the following statements, if any, regarding diathermy (electrosurgery) is true?",Frequencies above 200 KHz should not be used due to risk of electrocution,Plates must be properly adhered or inadequate current will be generated and will impede cutting,Diathermy utilises frequencies of 50-100 KHz,Plates must be properly adhered to prevent local burns,None of the above,D,Module 5 of the MRCOG syllabus states candidates should have:Knowledge and awareness of use in complications of Diathermy and other energy sources.In practice there are 2 safety issues with diathermy you must know about.1. Diathermy uses higher frequencies (500 KHz) as lower frequencies cause depolarisation and may cause electric shock. 2. The plate dissipates current over a large area. if it becomes partially detached current is concentrated to a smaller area and may cause burnsDiathermy Diathermy BasicsIn surgical diathermy (or electrosurgery) AC current is passed through a conductor with some energy appearing as heat. There are 2 types of DiathermyMonopolar Current passed from small electrode held by surgeon and returned to a large area plate via patients tissues. The concentrated current at the electrode tip produces a lot of heat whereas the current is dissipated over a large area at the plate.It is important the plate is properly attached as if the plate area is reduced the current concentrates and can cause tissue burnsBipolar Current passes between two electrodes held by surgeon as forceps.Diathermy can be used for cutting or coagulating. Bipolar is used to coagulate not cut. In cutting (monopoly) the waveform can be varied. A continuous single frequency sine wave is often used. Pulsed waves can reduce local thermal tissue damage. To prevent cell deploarisation (especially in cardiac tissue) the frequency must be over 100 kHz. Below this electric shock or even electrocution could occur. In surgical practice frequencies of around 500KHz are used.
basic medicine,705,Which of the following is a branch of the pudendal nerve?,Genitofemoral nerve,Inferior gluteal nerve,Perineal nerve,Saphenous nerve,Superior gluteal nerve,C,"The pudendal nerve is derived from the second to fourth sacral segments. It courses through five regions:  Sacral region where the three sacral segments fuse Gluteal region Pudendal canal which begins at the posterior border of the ischioanal fossa and ends at the posterior edge of the urogenital diaphragm Deep perineal space, which is the fascial space between the superior and inferior fasciae of the urogenital diaphragm Superficial perineal space.  The pudendal nerve gives off the inferior rectal nerves. It then divides into two terminal branches:  The perineal nerve, and The dorsal nerve of the penis/clitoris."
basic medicine,706,Which one of the following statements regarding the sympathetic trunk ganglion is true?,Branches of the aortic plexus pass along the superior mesenteric artery to supply the sigmoid colon,The coeliac plexus gives branches to the ovaries,The left and right sacral sympathetic trunks join on the anterior wall of the rectum,The lumbar sympathetic trunk gives branches to the lower oesophageal sphincter,The pelvic plexuses are formed from the right and left branches of the hypogastric plexus,E,The lumbar sympathetic trunk gives off visceral branches to the aortic plexus which also descend to the hypogastric plexus. The left and right sacral sympathetic trunks join on the coccyx at the ganglion impar. Presynaptic fibres from the coeliac plexus pass to the adrenal medullas. Branches of the aortic plexus pass along the inferior mesenteric artery to supply the sigmoid colon. The pelvic plexuses are formed from the right and left branches of the hypogastric plexus and the sacral sympathetic trunk.

basic medicine,709,A 19-year old student is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and is started on olanzapine. Which of the following is the most common side effect that she may experience?,Cardiac arrhythmia,Elevated transaminases,Thrombocytopaenia,Urinary retention,Weight gain,E,"The answer is weight gain. Weight gain can be clinically significant, and in the trials was seen regardless of the patient\'s baseline BMI. Approximately 65% of patients treated with olanzapine experienced some degree of weight gain, and so it is important to discuss management strategies for this with patients prior to initiating therapy. All of the other side effects listed are also seen with olanzapine therapy, although arrhythmias and urinary retention are uncommon. Raised transaminases are seen in between 1 in 10 and 1 in 100 of patients treated, and thrombocytopaenia is rare. "
basic medicine,710,A patient is treated with hydralazine for the management of her blood pressure. Unfortunately she suffers profound hypotension after only five doses of medication. Which of the following characteristics does she most likely possess?,CYP 2D6 polymorphism,Fast acetylation,HLA-DR2 genotype,G6PD deficiency,Slow acetylation,E,"Slow acetylators often experience toxicity from drugs such as isoniazid, sulfonamides, procainamide, and hydralazine, whereas fast acetylators may not respond to isoniazid and hydralazine in the management of tuberculosis and hypertension. Sulphonamides are now rarely used due to problems with blood dyscrasias. Patients with G6PD deficiency suffer from toxicity when they are prescribed drugs which are also oxidising agents, such as anti-malarials, antibiotics like cuprofloxacin or many other drugs."
basic medicine,711,"Regarding prostate specific antigen (PSA), which of the following is correct?",Is a serine protease,Is found only in the prostate,Is required for sperm motility,Mutations of the PSA gene are aetiological in the development of prostate cancer,Significantly elevated concentrations are expected following digital rectal examination (DRE),A,"PSA was initially thought to be specific for the prostate, but we now realise that it is found in the peri-urethral glands, peri-anal glands and also in breast tumours. PSA concentrations are elevated in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), prostate cancer, and following procedures such as a prostate biopsy. Although there may be a small rise in PSA following digital rectal examination (DRE), elevated concentrations are not expected. Gene mutations are not associated with prosate cancer - which is associated with oncogenes such as c-myc, etc. Its role is in the liquefaction of seminal gel not in sperm motility. A normal PSA does not exclude prostate cancer, with studies showing a risk of 15% of prostate Ca in subjects with a PSA less than 4 ng/ml."
basic medicine,712,A 48-year-old woman is seen in the colorectal clinic with alteration in bowel habit. She also notes a definite weight gain over the past year. Examination of the abdomen is unremarkable. What is the likely diagnosis?,Graves' disease,Hyperparathyroidism,Hypothyroidism,Pituitary hyperthyroidism,Toxic nodular goitre,C,"Weight gain and constipation are important features of hypothyroidism, whilst others include:  Bradycardia Cold intolerance Hyporeflexia Myopathy Weakness Coarse skin Poor memory, and Hoarse voice.  It is essential to examine carefully the neck of patients with constipation, especially if there are no other GI symptoms, and also request a thyroid function test."
basic medicine,713,Which of the following is correct with regards to injury to the common peroneal nerve?,Can occur following a fracture of the distal fibula,Causes a characteristic foot drop,Causes loss of inversion of the foot,Causes loss of flexion of the hallux,Produces anaesthesia of the sole of the foot,B,The common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. It winds around the neck of the fibula before dividing into the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. The latter is responsible for eversion of the ankle and dorsiflexion of the foot. Inversion is not lost as this is partially controlled by tibialis posterior supplied by the tibial nerve. Sensation to the sole of the foot is by the medial and lateral plantar branches of the tibial nerve.
basic medicine,714,Which of the following is true regarding bile acids?,Are about 50% reabsorbed from the intestinal lumen,Are conjugated with taurine and glycine before excretion into bile,Are formed in the distal ileum,Are synthesised at up to 10 mg/day in normal individuals,Cannot be metabolised by intestinal bacteria,B,"Bile acids are synthesised from cholesterol by the liver (300-500 mg/day), stored in the gallbladder and undergo enterohepatic reabsorption, where approximately 96% of bile acids are reabsorbed. Intestinal metabolism by excessive gut flora may result in malabsorption and diarrhoea."
basic medicine,715,A 45 year old male is admitted with acute pancreatitis. He is found to have a very elevated triglyceride level and slightly high cholesterol. Which treatment should be commenced to reduce his risk of further episodes of acute pancreatitis?,Nil required,Niacin,Statin,Omega 3 fish oils,Fibrate,E,Increased triglycerides leads to an increased risk of pancreatitis. Fibrates are the most effective in lowering triglycerides. Niacin and omega 3 are also effective. Statins at a high dose are effective in lowering triglycerides as well as cholesterol.
basic medicine,716,Which of the following does not increase the risk of HIV acquisition?,Bacterial Vaginosis,Trichomoniasis,Herpes Simplex,Gonorrhoea,Male circumcision,E,"Acquiring HIV & STIsThe presence of an inflammatory STD significantly increases susceptibility to HIV, with a relative increased risk of acquiring HIV of 1.5 to 2.2. The risk effect is greater for men than for women. Multiple studies have demonstrated that genital ulcer disease increases the risk of HIV acquisition, with active clinical lesions increasing the risk by about 2.1 to 2.7 fold. The increased link between HSV and HIV acquisition is well established.BV has been linked to increased risk of HIV as well as possible increased risk of transmission. Circumcised males have been shown to have a lower risk of HIV acquisition. Transmitting HIV & STIsThe risk of transmitting HIV is affected when an HIV-infected person has either an inflammatory or ulcerative STD. Gonorrhea, chlamydia, and trichomoniasis significantly increase HIV shedding from the genital tract. Furthermore, the treatment of NSU, gonococcal or chlamydial infection reduces the semen HIV RNA levels in HIV-infected men. Similarly, treating cervicitis caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, or trichomonas reduces HIV RNA levels in cervical or vaginal secretions in HIV-infected women. HIV in Pregnancy Key Points HIV in PregnancyHIV is a lentivirus (retrovirus) Primarily infects CD4+ T-helper cells UK prevalence around 2 per 1000 live births (3.5 per 1000 in london and 0.7 per 1000 in rest of England) Rate of HIV Mother to child transmission was 25% in 1993. With retroviral therapy and appropriate care rate had decreased to 1.2% by 2006 Use of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) can reduce vertical transmission rate toHIV can be transmitted via breastfeeding so breastfeeding should be avoided regardless of viral load.Management HIV during labourDeciding Mode of delivery in women taking cARTViral load should be checked at 36 weeks then delivery planned as follows:Viral Load at 36 weeks RecommendationVaginal delivery50–399 HIV RNA copies/mL PLCS consideredTake into account the actual viral load, trajectory of viral load, length of time on treatment, adherence issues, obstetric factors and the womans views≥400 HIV RNA copies/mL PLCSMode of delivery Women taking Zidovudine mono therapyZidovudine mono therapy was widely used at the time of the 2012 guidelines but is rarely used anymore. At the time of writing the 2018 guidelines are still in final consultation draft format so you may still get asked about this as they form part of the previous guidelines Delivery by PLCS is recommended for women, except elite controllers, taking zidovudine monotherapy irrespective of plasma viral load at the time of deliveryZidovudine InfusionStill indicated for women with a viral load of >1000 HIV RNA copies/mL who present in labour or with ruptured membranes or who are admitted for planned CS.

basic medicine,717,Which of the following is true regarding platelets?,Are formed in the bone marrow from megakaryocytes,Contain adenosine triphosphate and serotonin,Have a lifespan in the circulation of about 30 days,In a normal person are predominately found in the spleen (more than 60%),Produce prostacyclin,A,"Platelets are membrane-encapsulated fragments of megakaryoctes. Although platelets have no nucleus, they are metabolically active and are able to express membrane receptors and release stored substances when triggered. They contain adenosine diphosphate and serotonin. However, because they have no nucleus they are unable to produce new proteins and therefore aspirin and other drugs affect function for the remainder of the platelet lifespan. Platelet lifespan is approximately 9-10 days in normal individuals. Platelets are capable of producing nitric oxide, prostaglandins and thromboxane, but not the vasodilator prostacyclin."
basic medicine,718,Which one of the above does not pass through the superficial inguinal ring?,Lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh,Ilioinguinal nerve,Sympathetic plexus,Round ligament of the uterus,Genital branch of the genito-femoral nerve,A,"INGUINAL CANAL• 4cm long in adults• Deep ring: - oval shaped hole in transversalis fascia, 1.3cm above inguinal ligament, mid-way between anterior superior iliac spine and symphysis pubis.

basic medicine,723,"A 16-year-old male is brought to the Emergency department with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) rating of 3/15. Within 10 minutes he regained consciousness with a GCS of 15/15, is sitting up and talking. What is he likely to have taken?",Inhaled solvent glue,Smoked heroin,Smoked marijuana,Snorted cocaine,Taken ecstacy,A,"This patient was markedly comatose on arrival but quickly regains consciousness. This suggests a short acting (probably) inhaled anaesthetic-like agent - glue. Marijuana would not be expected to produce this level of coma and the effects of cocaine would last much longer. The inhaled solvents, due to their lipophilicity, are rapidly absorbed through the lungs and then quickly distributed to the brain and other organs. The effects therefore appear within minutes of inhalation. It's much less common to get such a low GCS with just smoking heroin, you tend to see this with intravenous drug use. Also, the recovery is far less rapid (unless you give the patient naloxone, which you are not told here). Typical substances that are inhaled include toluene, aromatic hydrocarbons and butane."

basic medicine,735,A 41-year-old female is brought into the Emergency department after taking an uncertain quantity of paracetamol two hours previously and trying to hang herself. She becomes agitated and insists that she wants to go home immediately. You judge that she is at high risk of suicide. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for this patient?,Ask her to sign a 'discharge against medical advice' form and let her go,"Call the duty psychiatrist, but let the patient go if she insists and the duty psychiatrist does not arrive in time to see her","Call the hospital security services, restrain her and sedate her",Detain her under section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act,"Detain the patient under common law, seeking the help of hospital security services",E,"This patient has taken an unknown quantity of paracetamol tablets, and continues to have suicidal ideation. In situations such as these you need to assess whether the patient has capacity. Taking a paracetamol overdose in itself does not mean the patient has no capacity, but often capacity is lacking. The chance of suffering severe consequences if a paracetamol overdose goes untreated is high. Often, therefore these patients do not possess the level of capacity required for a decision of this importance. Family should be involved if possible. In cases such as this the patient, if found to lack capacity, should be held under common law until the appropriate time to take a blood sample (four hours after the overdose). Psychiatric team advice can be sought, but they need the patient to be 'medically fit' to be able to do a full assessment. In general this means they must have completed all treatment necessary (for example,. NAC infusion) prior to mental health assessment. Allowing self-discharge in this situation would be inappropriate. Sedation is inappropriate in this situation. Section 5(2) of the Mental Health Act is used for patients who are already admitted to the hospital who have a mental illness, to allow compulsory detention for up to 72 hours. Formal assessment under the Mental Health Act should be undertaken as soon as possible. It is not used in the Emergency department. "
basic medicine,736,Which of the following is true regarding aldosterone?,Has a constant level of secretion,Has an equal affinity to cortisol for the mineralocorticoid receptor,Is secreted by the zona fasciculata,Is synthesised from amino acids,Secretion increases in the presence of hypokalaemia,B,"Aldosterone is a steroid hormone (mineralocorticoid) synthesised from cholesterol by the enzyme aldosterone synthetase. It is formed in zona glomerulosa, which is the outer section of the adrenal cortex. It helps regulate the electrolyte balance by stimulating the excretion of potassium ions and retaining sodium ions and water. The mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) are intracellular. Aldosterone is synthesised in reaction to increases of angiotensin II, or plasma potassium, which are present in proportion to sodium deficiencies. Sodium deficiency and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (short term stimulation only) also stimulate aldosterone secretion. Atrial natriuretic hormone or peptide, hypernatraemia and hypokalaemia suppress aldosterone secretion. Aldosterone secretion has a diurnal rhythm, with approximately 75% being secreted between 0400 and 1000 hours. The mineralocorticoid receptor binds both aldosterone and cortisol with equal affinity. Moreover, the same DNA sequence serves as a hormone response element for the activated (steroid-bound) forms of both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors. How then can aldosterone stimulate specific biological effects in this kind of system, particularly when blood concentrations of cortisol are something like 2000-fold higher than aldosterone? A large part of the answer is that in aldosterone-responsive cells, cortisol is effectively destroyed, allowing aldosterone to bind its receptor without competition. Target cells for aldosterone express the enzyme 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which has no effect on aldosterone, but converts cortisol to cortisone, which has only a very weak affinity for the mineralocorticoid receptor. In essence, this enzyme 'protects' the cell from cortisol, and allows aldosterone to act appropriately. Some tissues (for example, hippocampus) express abundant mineralocorticoid receptors, but not 11-beta HSD; they therefore do not show responses to aldosterone, because aldosterone is not present in quantities sufficient to compete with cortisol. An interesting demonstration of this enzyme protection system is seen in chronic liquorice intoxication for the activated (steroid-bound) forms of both mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors."

basic medicine,742,A 65-year-old man has locally advanced pancreatic cancer and has been paying privately for treatment with erlotinib (Tarceva) for the past nine months. It has worked effectively for that period but a recent CT scan showed further growth in the tumour. Which of the following mechanisms best explains this resistance to treatment with erlotinib?,Development of antibodies to erlotinib,Lack of autophosphorylation at binding site,Malabsorption,Mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain,Reduced expression of EGFR,D,"Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase (which is required for the conformational change) and binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate binding site. For the signal to be transmitted, two members of the EGFR family need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to autophosphorylate each other, which causes a conformational change in their intracellular structure, exposing a further binding site for binding proteins that cause a signal cascade to the nucleus. By inhibiting the ATP, autophosphorylation is not possible and the signal is stopped. A key issue with EGFR-directed treatments is that after a period of 8-12 months, the cancer cells become resistant to the treatment. This most commonly occurs due to a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain. This prevents the binding of erlotinib (Tarceva). Some IGR-1R inhibitors are in various stages of development (based either around tyrphostins such as AG1024 or AG538 or pyrrolo[2,3-d]-pyrimidine derivatives such as NVP-AEW541)."

basic medicine,749,How long will it take for a Cesarean section wound closed by primary intention to reach full tensile strength?,4 weeks,8 weeks,12 weeks,22 weeks,34 weeks,C,"Wound healing is typically divided into four phases. The four phases of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase: This is the initial phase that starts immediately after the injury occurs. The body's response involves vasoconstriction and the formation of a blood clot .Inflammatory Phase: Following hemostasis, the inflammatory phase begins and can last for several days. During this phase, the body triggers an inflammatory response to remove debris, foreign substances, and bacteria from the wound. Immune cells, growth factors, and other chemicals are released to initiate the healing process.Proliferative Phase: After the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase starts, lasting for several weeks. New tissue is formed through the action of fibroblasts, which produce collagen, and other cells. The wound is filled with granulation tissue, which contains new blood vessels and collagen.Remodeling Phase: The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase. It can last for several months to years after the injury. During this phase, the collagen fibers reorganize and gain strength, and the wound contracts and becomes smaller. The goal is to improve the wound's tensile strength and functionality, although it may not reach the original strength of the uninjured tissue entirely."

basic medicine,756,Which of the following parts of the nephron has receptors for antidiuretic hormone (ADH) (vasopressin)?,Glomerulus,Distal convoluted tubule,Collecting duct,Ascending limb of the loop of Henle,Proximal convoluted tubule,C,"ADH is essential to control homeostasis of fluid. ADH acts on receptors in the collecting duct.The collecting duct also contains aquaporins which are permeable to water. Should the body need to retain fluid, for example when dehydrated, ADH is released from the posterior pituitary. On binding to its receptor, it encourages the opening of these aquaporins, leading to the reabsorption of water into the body. When the aquaporins are closed the remaining filtrate passes out of the collecting duct and eventually to the ureters and bladder.The proximal convoluted tubule is responsible for reabsorption of up to 80% of water and ions.The glomerulus acts as a barrier, filtering out red cells and large proteins, leaving a filtrate in the nephrons that is largely glucose, ions and water."

The other drugs listed are vasodilators in action. Diazoxide and sodium nitroprusside can be used intravenously in hypertensive emergencies. Minoxidil is reserved for when hypertension is resistant to other treatments; it causes fluid retention and oedema, however, it is effective in combination with a beta blocker and loop diuretic. Hydralazine can be given orally also in combination with a diuretic and beta blocker. Side effects include reflex tachycardia and fluid retention."
basic medicine,772,During translation,ATP is not required,The mRNA molecule is translated from the 3-end to the 5-end,Amino acids have to be bound to tRNA before they can be added to the protein chain,Amino acids have to be transferred into the endoplasmic reticulum before they can be added to the protein chain,Amino acids must be bound to mRNA before they can be added to the protein chain,C,"The mRNA molecule is translated from the 5- end to the 3- end• For an amino acid to be added to the protein chain, it must be bound to a tRNA moleculein a reaction catalysed by aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. There are 20 enzymes, each specific fora particular amino acid. During this reaction, ATP is hydrolysed to AMP + 2Pi• The binding of tRNA molecules to the mRNA molecule is less stringent than the pairing ofcomplementary DNA strands. Pairing may still occur when the third position on the mRNAcodon read from the 5- to 3- end and the first position on the anticodon on the aminoacyl-tRNAis not an exact match: the WOBBLE hypothesis"
basic medicine,773,"In hereditary haemochromatosis, the underlying mutation results in which of the following?",Insertion,Translocation,Deletion,Substitution,Frameshift,D,The most common mutation found in hereditary haemochromatosis is C282Y which results in the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine.
basic medicine,774,In which circumstance would the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive pill (OCP) be reduced?,Oral omeprazole given for gastritis,Oral rifampicin given as acute prophylaxis for meningitis,Oral metronidazole given for trichomoniasis,Oral sodium valproate for epilepsy,Oral tetracycline two months into treatment for acne,B,"Certain drugs are known to reduce the effectiveness of the OCP.Hepatic enzyme‐inducing antiepileptic drugs lower oral contraceptive pill hormone levels by approximately 40%. These include:∙ Carbamazepine∙ Rifampicin, and∙ Phenytoin.There is no conclusive evidence that antibiotics, which are not enzyme inducers, affect the efficacy of the combined oral contraceptive pill.In contrast, valproic acid (Depakene) and gabapentin (Neurontin) do not interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptive pills."
basic medicine,775,A 29 year old patient who is 15 weeks pregnant comes to see you. She currently has chickenpox. She is concerned her baby may get congenital fetal varicella syndrome (FVS). What would you advise her the risk of this is?,0.40%,5.00%,2.00%,20.00%,10.00%,C,2.0%Congenital fetal varicella syndrome may occur if there is maternal varicella infection (chickenpox) during the 1st 20 weeks of gestation. The risk of FVS to babies born to mothers who have chickenpox during the first 20 weeks gestation is 0.4% (1-12 weeks) - 2.0% (13-20 weeks). If a mother has chickenpox in late pregnancy (5 days prior to delivery) then there is risk of neonatal varicella infection which may be severe. FVS can cause the following abnormalitiesHypoplasia of one limb Cicatricial lesions with a dermatomal distribution CNS abnormalities Eye abnormalitiesVaricella Zoster Varicella Zoster is the virus responsible for Chicken pox and shingles. If Chickenpox occurs during pregnancy the Green Top Guidelines advise the following:VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has developed and should therefore not be used in pregnant women who have developed a chickenpox rash. Intravenous aciclovir should be given to all pregnant women with severe chickenpox Oral aciclovir should be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox if they present within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if they are 20+0 weeks of gestation or beyond. Use of aciclovir before 20+0 weeks should also be considered
basic medicine,776,Which anatomical structure is at risk during tracheostomy?,Glossopharyngeal nerve,Oesophagus,Right brachiocephalic vein,Superior thyroid vein,Thymus,E,The inferior thyroid vein forms a plexus anterior to the trachea which is at risk. The left brachiocephalic vein and jugular venous arch may be encountered particularly in infants and children. The oesophagus lies posterior to the trachea and therefore is not at risk. The pleura may be encountered in low tracheostomies particularly in infants and children. The thymus covers the inferior part of the trachea in infants and children. Other structures at risk are the thyroid isthmus and the small thyroid ima artery.
basic medicine,777,Ketone bodies are produced when,The rate of fatty acid oxidation exceeds oxygen availability,he rate of carbohydrate breakdown exceeds the rate of protein synthesis,The rate of fatty acid oxidation exceeds the rate of glycerol synthesis,The rate of glycolysis exceeds oxygen availability,The rate of fatty acid oxidation exceeds the rate of carbohydrate breakdown,E,"FATTY ACID OXIDATION∙ If the rate of fatty acid oxidation exceeds the rate of carbohydrate breakdown, more acetyl CoA isgenerated than can be converted to oxaloacetate - acetyl CoA is then converted to ketone bodies:acetoacetate and hydroxybutyrate∙ Ketone bodies are produced mainly by the liver and used as fuel particularly by the heart, muscle andrenal cortex. During starvation, the brain may also utilise ketone bodies. The brain, however, metabolisesmainly glucose∙ After a three-day fast, 30% of the energy used by the brain is from ketone bodies. And after 40 days, thisgoes up to 70%∙ Both acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate are acidic, and if levels of ketone bodies are toohigh,ketoacidosis occurs. This happens in untreated Type I diabetes and in alcoholics after bingedrinking and subsequent starvation ∙ Ketone bodies are water soluble and may be excreted in the breath (acetone) or in urine causingketonuria∙ The fetal brain is an obligate glucose user and cannot utilise ketone bodies"
basic medicine,778,Which one of the following is correct concerning the pituitary?,An oral glucose tolerance test is used to assess posterior pituitary function,LH and FSH are secreted by different cells,"LH, FSH and TSH share the same common alpha subunit",The anterior pituitary secretes oxytocin,The most common cell type in the pituitary is a prolactin secreting cell,C,"The pituitary is composed of anterior and posterior components, and is controlled through hypothalamic regulatory hormones which are in turn controlled by negative feedback. The anterior pituitary secretes:  Luteinising hormone (LH) Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) Growth hormone (GH) Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) Prolactin (PRL), and Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  Gonadotrophs secrete LH and FSH. The alpha subunits of both LH/FSH and TSH are identical. The posterior pituitary secretes oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH). The commonest cell type in the pituitary is the somatotroph - GH producing cells. The commonest pituitary tumour is the prolactinoma (particularly microprolactinomas) common in females and treated with dopamine agonists. The anterior pituitary function is assessed through the OGTT (GH levels should fall) and the insulin tolerance test."
basic medicine,779,Which of the following suggests damage to the oculomotor nerve (CNIII)?,The eye is deviated downwards and medially at rest,Ptosis of the upper eyelid on the affected side,Inability to laterally deviate the eye on that side,A light shone into the affected eye does not produce constriction of the opposite pupil,Constricted pupil on the affected side,B,The oculomotor nerve supplies the levator palpebrae superioris
basic medicine,780,Chemotherapy is often given after the cancer has been completely removed by surgery rather than prior to surgery. What is the reason for this?,Because chemotherapy prior to surgery is unproven clinically,Because the patient cannot tolerate chemotherapy before surgery,To ensure all the cancer cells are in the most sensitive cell cycle phase,To reduce the chance of chemotherapy resistance,To reduce the chance of micrometastasis,E,"Adjuvant chemotherapy is commonly given in many cancers to reduce the risk of local or distant recurrence or metastasis. This confers a survival benefit to the patient but is not without risks which should be explained to the patient during consenting. One of the most serious complications is neutropenic sepsis, which if untreated, could result in a patient's death. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is commonly given to downstage a cancer to make it either operable or to reduce the need for radical surgery. It is often followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy."
basic medicine,781,A 40-year-old woman with early breast cancer is referred to the oncology clinic for consideration of radiotherapy to her breast following wide local excision. What is the role of adjuvant radiotherapy in this case?,To improve wound healing,To increase overall survival,To reduce keloid scarring,To reduce local recurrence,To reduce skin metastasis,D,"Adjuvant radiotherapy is recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) given after wide local excision of a breast tumour to reduce the risk of local recurrence. Following meta-analysis there is no increased survival benefit largely due to complications of radiotherapy treatment. It has been shown to be equivalent to mastectomy, which can therefore be avoided in resectable tumours. The nodal areas, particularly the supraclavicular fossa and axilla can also be treated in patients considered to be at higher risk of relapse. It is usually given daily (Monday-Friday) for five weeks, although shorter fractionation schedules are given in some centres. This can be followed by a boost to the tumour bed over 1-2 weeks in patients who have had breast conserving surgery. There is growing evidence that adjuvant radiotherapy also increases survival for those patients at high risk of relapse. There is however a risk of increased cardiovascular mortality after 15-20 years, which may be reduced with the use of modern techniques such as conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Radiotherapy does improve the appearance of scars and can reduce keloid scarring but it is only rarely given for this indication. Wound healing can be reduced after radiotherapy, and a period of at least a few weeks is usually given between surgery and initiation of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy has not been shown to have a specific impact on the incidence of skin metastasis. "
basic medicine,782,Which of the following is the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin?,Cell wall inhibition,Inhibition of folic acid metabolism,Inhibition of protein synthesis (transcription),Inhibition of protein synthesis (translation),Interference with DNA replication,E,Ciprofloxacin interferes with DNA synthesis by disrupting the function of DNA gyrase.
basic medicine,783,Which of the following is correct with regard to T lymphocytes?,Are the primary host response in bacterial infection,They produce IgG,Are infected by Epstein‐Barr virus in infectious mononucleosis,They compose the majority of lymphocytes in plasma,T cell lymphoma has a better prognosis,D,"Epstein‐Barr virus infects B lymphocytes and squamous epithelial cells of the oropharynx.The primary host response to bacterial infections is dependent on mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils.T lymphocytes compose the majority of circulating lymphocytes in plasma.T lymphocytes are involved in cell‐mediated acquired immune responses, whereas B lymphocytes are involved in humoral immunity and produce immunoglobulins.The virus can transform B cells and epithelial cells to produce Burkitt's lymphoma, a subset of Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and oral hairy leukoplakia.T cell lymphoma makes up about 10‐20% of non‐Hodgkin's lymphomas and has a worse prognosis than B cell lymphoma."
basic medicine,784,"In acute chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting, which of the following is most useful in addition to ondansetron?",Prochlorperazine,Domperidone,Metoclopramide,Cyclizine,Dexamethasone,E,5HT3 receptor antagonists such as ondansetron plus dexamethasone have been recommended in guidelines in the first instance.

basic medicine,786,A 35-year-old female presents to head and neck clinic with a small lump in the anterior triangle of her neck. Which of the following is true regarding Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC)?,Colloid fine needle aspirate is suspicious of malignancy,FNAC can diagnose papillary carcinoma,FNA excludes malignancy,FNA revealing follicular cells indicates malignancy,The diagnosis of follicular carcinoma can be made with FNA,B,"Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is a useful investigation for patients presenting with a solitary thyroid nodule. However, diagnosis depends on the material aspirated and there is a false negative rate of between 1 and 6%. FNAC is extremely accurate at diagnosing papillary carcinoma. Follicular cells can be found with follicular adenoma and carcinoma. Therefore, the diagnosis of follicular carcinoma cannot be made with FNAC. Colloid and macrophages in the aspirate strongly suggest benign disease. The reporting of thyroid cytology is categorised as follows:  Thy 1 - Non diagnostic sample Thy 2 - Non Neoplastic Thy 3 - Neoplasm possible, e.g. follicular cells identified Thy 4 - Suspicious of malignancy Thy 5 - Malignancy  "
basic medicine,787,A 63-year-old smoker presents with haemoptysis. There is a right hilar mass on the chest x ray and the right hemidiaphragm is elevated. Which nerve is involved?,External laryngeal nerve,Left vagus,Right phrenic,Right vagus,Sympathetic chain,C,"The right phrenic nerve passes over the front of the right hilum and is more frequently involved in malignant disease than the left, which passes more anteriorly. The phrenic nerve is the only motor supply to the diaphragm. It also supplies sensation to the central part of the diaphragm. Traumatic injury to the phrenic nerve and involvement in malignant processes can result in paralysis of the corresponding half of the diaphragm."
basic medicine,788,"The Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is used to amplify small amounts of DNA for further analysis. To do this, the DNA double helix must first be split into two strands. How is this achieved?",Alkali solution,Centrifugation,DNA polymerase,Heating to nearly 100°C,Viral reverse transcriptase,D,"PCR typically uses a small sample of DNA, to which are added two oligonucleotides with sequences that have affinity for both ends of the area of DNA that is being studied. A thermostable DNA polymerase is also added. At 94°C, DNA melts into two single strands and with cooling, the oligonucleotides bind to the areas surrounding the particular area of DNA that is being analysed. These act as primers for the DNA polymerase and a new double helix of DNA is formed. The cycle is repeated doubling the amount of DNA each time."

basic medicine,790,Which is true of renal physiology?,Approximately 20% of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule of the nephron,Arginine vasopressin (AVP) reduces the permeability of the distal convoluted tubule to water,Intraluminal fluid entering the distal convoluted tubule is hypertonic with respect to the surrounding extracellular fluid,The ascending limb of the loop of Henle is highly impermeable to water,There is active transport of Na^+ out of the descending limb of the loop of Henle,D,"The loop of Henle (LOH) employs a sodium counter-current mechanism to provide hypertonic conditions (approximately 1,200 mmol/L, mainly sodium chloride and urea) in the deep medulla of the kidney. This permits the production of concentrated urine if required. The active component of the LOH is the ascending limb. Here chloride, and hence sodium, are pumped out of the tubule into the interstitium. The ascending limb of the LOH is impermeable to water. The descending limb of the LOH is permeable to sodium chloride and water. The net effect is for sodium chloride to leave the ascending limb and to enter the descending limb, having first passed through the renal medullary interstitium. Some water is also lost from the descending limb. As the tubular fluid passes through the ascending limb it becomes increasingly dilute as the sodium chloride is removed. As a result the fluid entering the distal convoluted tubule is hypotonic (150 mmol/L)."

basic medicine,792,A patient requires a blood transfusion following joint replacement surgery. She asks you about the risks of acquiring a transfusion-related infection. Which infection is routinely tested for in donated blood?,Cytomegalovirus (CMV),Hepatitis A,Malaria,Syphilis,Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD),D,"In the United Kingdom every blood donation is routinely screened for evidence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, HIV I, HIV II, HTLV (human T-cell lymphotrophic virus) and syphilis. Donor selection is designed to exclude potentially infectious individuals from donating blood. If a donor has been exposed to transmissable infection abroad (all donors are asked about foreign travel) their blood will be tested for malaria or Trypanosoma cruzi (Chaga's disease). CMV testing may be carried out for transfusions specifically intended for immunocompromised patients. Some countries exclude donors who lived in the United Kingdom over the period of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic, but blood is not screened for vCJD in this country."
basic medicine,793,Which nerve constitutes the afferent (sensory) supply to the piriform fossa?,External laryngeal ,Glossopharyngeal (IX) ,Hypoglossal (XII) ,Internal laryngeal ,Recurrent laryngeal,D,"The internal laryngeal nerve is afferent from the mucous membrane of the larynx. The area of mucosa supplied extends from the epiglottis and the back of the tongue down to the vocal folds. Simulation of the internal laryngeal nerve results in sensations of touch and pain. The nerve pierces the thyrohyoid membrane above the superior laryngeal artery and divides into terminal branches. A twig is given to the transverse arytenoid muscle, but whether these fibres are motor or proprioceptive is disputed. The internal laryngeal nerve ends by joining branches of the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The anastomosis may take place behind or in the substance of the posterior crico-arytenoid and the connection may pierce the inferior constrictor of the pharynx."
basic medicine,794,Which statement regarding the optic chiasm is correct?,Fibres from the chiasm directly enter the optic radiation,The commissure of Gudden borders the posterior aspect of the chiasm,The fibres from the temporal retinae decussate within the chiasm,The optic chiasm is situated at the junction of the floor and anterior wall of the fourth ventricle,The optic chiasm lies posterior to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland,B,"The optic chiasm is situated at the junction of the floor and anterior wall of the third ventricle. The fibres of the nasal half of the retinae decussate in the chiasm and enter the optic tracts before becoming the optic radiation. The chiasm lies immediately superior to the pituitary fossa, an important fact to bear in mind when considering superior extension of a pituitary tumour. The commissure of Gudden is a connecting link between the medial geniculate bodies and is not derived from the optic nerves. This is a difficult question but with a modicum of general knowledge of the optic chiasm one can reach the answer by a process of elimination."
basic medicine,795,Which of the following are correct concerning an intention to treat analysis?,It is a study comparing the effects of treatment with placebo or active treatment and also a similar group of non-study participants,It is a study that analyses all patients randomised to the study,It is a study where all included patients are treated with the active drug,It is a study where all non-compliant patients are removed from analysis,It is a variation of a meta-analysis analysing specifically studies employing double blind placebo controlled trials,B,"When one considers a randomised study, although the principles of double blind placebo controlled may apply, the actual preferential fall out of patients, for instance treated with placebo as they do not perceive a benefit, may itself introduce bias. Thus, intention to treat studies would argue that one should commit all patients that originally participate in the study to analysis. The advantages of this approach are that it maintains treatment groups that are similar apart from random variation. This is the reason for randomisation, and the feature may be lost if analysis is not performed on the groups produced by the randomisation process. Secondly, it permits for non-compliance and deviations from policy by clinicians. "
basic medicine,796,Which GLUT transporter plays a role in glucose sensing?,GLUT 5,GLUT 1,GLUT 2,GLUT 3,GLUT 4,C,GLUT 2 is found on beta cells and transports glucose into these cells and thus is important in glucose sensing.

Amyloidosis is a disorder characterised by extracellular deposits of the degradation resistant protein. They are usually divided into:  Primary amyloidosis (where no cause in found), and Secondary amyloidosis (due to chronic states such as tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, rheumatoid arthritis, osteomyelitis and neoplasia).  Amyloid accumulates to cause a simple bulk effect or could accumulate around the vessels to cause vascular occlusion. It can also affect the kidneys, liver and spleen presenting as nephrotic syndrome or hepatosplenomegaly. Rectum is the favoured site for biopsy and the diagnosis of amyloidosis is made after Congo red staining of the affected tissue. Surgery rarely helps. Secondary amyloidosis may improve if the primary disease is treated. Immunosuppression may cause deposits to regress."
basic medicine,803,A 72-year-old male presented to his GP with depression after the death of his wife. His notes also reveal that he has a two year history of urinary hesitancy and poor stream. His GP prescribed him some medication and the following day he developed acute urinary retention. Which of the following drugs is most likely to have precipitated the urinary retention?,Amitriptyline,Diazepam,Fluoxetine,Venlafaxine,Zopiclone,A,"Amitriptyline has anticholinergic effects being associated with tachycardia, dry mouth and urinary retention. These features are not typical of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine or seratonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine with urinary retention and dry mouth rarely reported. Diazepam, a benzodiazepine does not have anticholinergic effects. It has been associated with urinary retention, but this is much less common than with anticholinergics. Zopiclone is a benzodiazepine-like agent the side effects of which side effects include daytime drowsiness. It is not commonly associated with urinary retention."

What is the next correct step in endocrine management of this patient?,Continue anastrozole,Continue anastrozole and prescribe a bisphosphonate.,Stop anastrozole,Stop anastrozole and convert to exemestane,Stop anastrozole and start tamoxifen,B,"In a post-menopausal woman the endocrine treatment of choice for preventing recurrence of her primary breast cancer is an aromatase inhibitor. Aromatase inhibitors work by causing severe oestrogen deprivation which increases the risk of osteoporosis. Aromatase inhibitors can be continued in a patient who has suffered no fragility fractures providing adequate measures are taken for bone protection, for example, prescribing a bisphosphonate. In patients who suffer a fragility fracture tamoxifen must be considered as this does have a partial oestrogen agonist action on bone, reducing the risk of osteoporosis."

The intravascular pressure wave is conducted from the catheter tip, (situated in the arterial lumen), to the transducer, along fluid-filled tubing. Pressurised fluid is infused through the catheter continuously. The transducer is usually a strain gauge variable resistor, which is connected to an amplifier and oscilloscope. The transducer should be placed at the height of the left atrium at all times. Air bubbles and long catheter tubing have the effect of dampening the trace (waveform appears rounded). Increased damping usually lowers the systolic pressure and elevates the diastolic pressure."

She cries immediately and is brought to the emergency department. An x-ray of her elbow shows a displaced supracondylar fracture of her humerus. What nerve is most likely to be injured by this fracture?,Anterior interosseous,Axillary nerve,Posterior interosseous,Superficial branch of radial nerve,Ulnar nerve,A,The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve is the most likely to be damaged in supracondylar fractures of the humerus. The (close) second is the radial nerve. The ulnar nerve may be damaged by flexion injuries (which are only 2-4% of injuries and uually occcur in older individuals). The vast majority of nerve injuries are neuropraxia. Displaced fractures can cause compromise to the vascular supply of the forearm by injuring the brachial artery. The anterior interosseous branch of the median nerve is the most likely nerve to be damaged. This can be tested by asking the child to make an 'O' shape with their thumb and index finger.
basic medicine,814,A new drug is being studied to find the most appropriate dose in a dose response study. Small doses of the drug lead to a linear increase in serum drug concentration. At higher doses there is an exponential rise in serum drug concentration. Which of the following best describes the pharmacokinetic properties of this new drug?,First order kinetics,First pass effect,Long plasma half life,Saturation kinetics,Zero order kinetics,D,"The description of the kinetics of this new drug show that with small doses there is a linear response (first order kinetics) to dosing but this becomes saturated and the serum concentration of the drug rises sharply (zero order kinetics). Drugs following zero order kinetics continue to be metabolised at a steady rate, independent of the concentration of the substrate. The plot of metabolism against time is linear. Drugs which have saturation kinetics initially follow a linear line, but then their metabolism slows down leading to a plateau of the line, for example due to enzyme depletion. Small doses in the drug then lead to large increases in plasma concentration. This response is typical of drugs such as phenytoin (saturates liver metabolism)."

His Wilson's is well controlled with trientine, and they would like to start a family. Which of the following approximates to their likely chance of having an affected child?",0.50%,5%,10%,25%,50%,A,"The answer is 0.5%. This question relies on the knowledge that Wilson's is an autosomal recessive disorder, and a rough knowledge of the frequency of heterozygous carriage of the Wilson's genetic mutation, which is approximately 1 in 90. Given this patient has a 100% chance of passing on an affected gene to his offspring, this puts the chance of having an affected child as 1 in 180 , or approximately 0.5%. This is explained by the fact that there is a 1 in 90 chance that his girlfriend carries the mutated gene, and a 1 in 2 chance that her child will inherit this if she is a carrier. 50% would be the chance of having an affected child assuming the disease was autosomal dominant, or if the female partner was confirmed as heterozygous for Wilson's by genetic screening. 25% is the chance of having an affected child in an autosomal recessive disease if both parents are confirmed as carriers. The 10% and 5% values would assume that Wilson's has a higher carrier frequency than 1 in 90, and as such must be incorrect."

basic medicine,852,Which of the following is true regarding arterial blood gas analysis?,Can be interpreted without knowing the body temperature,Indicates an acidaemia if there is a high plasma pH,Is an essential pre-operative investigation in all patients with pulmonary disease,Is performed on heparinised blood obtained by venepuncture,Specimens must be kept covered by ice prior to analysis,A,"Arterial blood gas analysis requires knowledge of the inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) before interpretation is possible. Arterial blood is aspirated from a superficial artery into a heparinised syringe. Local anaesthetic infiltration renders the procedure relatively painless. Normal values taken on air are:  PaO2 of 13.3 kPa (100 mm Hg) PCO2 of 5.3 kPa (40 mm Hg).  A high plasma pH is an alkalaemia and a low pH is an acidaemia. The variation in pH, PaCO2 and PaO2 between 35°C and 39°C is small. Corrections are required for hypothermia and hyperpyrexia. Newer machines will calculate the correction for temperature. Obtaining a pre-operative blood gas on patients with pulmonary disease is not always indicated. Providing a result is available from within three months of the operation date and the patient's symptoms remain unchanged, then a repeat test is unnecessary. Covering the sample syringe with ice reduces the inaccuracy which may result due to ongoing blood cell metabolism. However, this is only necessary when a delay between obtaining the sample and analysis is anticipated."

Investigations reveal:    Bilirubin 60 µmol/L (1-22)   Albumin 28 g/L (37-49)   AST 400 IU/L (5-40)   Alkaline phosphatase 400 IU/L (45-105)   Prothrombin time 35 seconds (less than14)    She was commenced on a new medication within the last three months. Which do you suspect may be contributing to the presentation?",Cabergoline,Carbamazepine,Lamotrigine,Metformin,Sodium valproate,E,"Sodium valproate can occasionally have an idiosyncratic response leading to severe or even fatal hepatic toxicity. This is more common if the patient has a metabolic or degenerative disorder, organic brain disease or severe seizures associated with learning difficulties. Usually this reaction occurs within the first three months of therapy. Carbamazepine can be associated with jaundice occasionally, however the history of learning difficulties and short history of drug use point to sodium valproate as the cause. Lamotrigine can disrupt liver function tests (LFTs). Metformin and cabergoline do not affect liver function however caution is advised when using these drugs in patients with hepatic disease."

basic medicine,861,A 60-year-old woman presents with a gradual onset of lumbar spine pain over the past two weeks associated with a gradual deterioration in her mobility. She has a past history of metastatic breast cancer to her bones currently controlled on anastrozole. An emergency MRI reveals widespread metastatic deposits in her spine with encroachment at L2 causing a moderate degree of spinal cord compression. What is the best course of action?,Emergency chemotherapy,Emergency radiotherapy,Emergency surgical decompression,Emergency surgical decompression and chemotherapy,Emergency surgical decompression and radiotherapy,E,"Spinal cord compression is a devastating complication of metastatic disease which needs to be treated promptly. The patient needs to be nursed flat in bed with neutral spine alignment and given high dose steroids until the MRI result is known. This should be continued until approximately 5-7 days after treatment is completed. The dose can be increased if there is worsening neurology.  Definitive treatment of MSCC is either surgery or radiotherapy. At present, relatively few patients with MSCC in the UK receive surgery. However, research evidence suggests that early surgery may be more effective than radiotherapy at maintaining mobility in a selected subset of patients. All decisions regarding the appropriate combination of treatment should be made by spinal surgeons and oncolgists involved in the care of the patient. Definitive treatment should be initiated before further neurological deterioration, ideally within 24 hours. When deciding definitive treatment the preference of the patient, neurological function, functional status, general health, likelihood of complications and prognosis should be taken into account. Age alone does not prohibit surgical management. NICE guidelines state that radiotherapy should be offered to patients with spinal metastases which are causing spinal pain. It is not indicated with the intention of preventing spinal cord compression in asymptomatic patients. Surgery should be considered urgently for patients with spinal metastases and evidence of structural spinal failure. The aim is achievement of spinal cord decompression and durable spinal column stability. Surgery is not curative, and therefore radiotherapy is typically given for local control of the tumour to prevent local recurrence. In general, chemotherapy has no role in the treatment of spinal cord compression. "

Absolute erythocytosis is a haematocrit greater than0.56 in women and greater than0.6 in men. Polycythaemia may be:  Primary (polycythaemia rubra vera) - untreated this has a life expectancy of 6-18 months, with treatment life expectancy rises to 20 years Secondary (chronic hypoxia stimulates erythropoetin) Apparent (Relative) (reduced plasma volume, normal red cell mass) Inappropriate (inappropriate erythropoetin production).  Polycythaemia leads to increased blood viscosity and sluggish blood flow, resulting in increased risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, ischaemic limbs and DVT. Approximately 50%-75% of patients will have splenic enlargement but not hepatic enlargement. Apparent erythocytois is usually related to to low plasma volume. This may occur in those taking diuretics, heavy smokers and those with a high alcohol intake. Peptic ulceration is common in polycythaemia rubra vera (primary). Haemorrhagic lesions may be a feature of the condition, especially of the gastrointestinal tract."
basic medicine,872,How many bronchopulmonary segments are contained in the left lung?,6,7,9,10,12,C,"The lungs are divided first into right and left, the left being smaller to accommodate the heart. The lungs are further subdivided into lobes (three on the right, two on the left) by the oblique and horizontal fissures on the right and only the oblique fissure on the left. Each lobe of the lung is further divided into pyramidal bronchopulmonary segments. Bronchopulmonary segments have the apex of the pyramid in the hilum whence they receive a tertiary bronchus, and appropriate blood vessels. There are 10 segments of the right lung and typically 9 on the left (there is no medial basal segment (VII) on the left, it is usually fused with the anterior basal segment (VIII)). However, on the left, it is not uncommon for one or more segmental bronchi to share a common stem (see Gray's Anatomy 41st Ed p959-962). Many sources state there are 8 segments on the left."

basic medicine,876,Which of the following is correct regarding the normal liver?,"A portal tract contains a branch of the portal vein, hepatic arteriole and bile duct","After feeding, the portal vein provides 35-40% of total liver blood flow",Hepatocytes only make up 20-30% of the total liver cell mass,The hepatic veins drain directly into the portal vein,There are no reticulo-endothelial cells,A,"The liver has classically been divided into 1-2 mm diameter hexagonal lobules with a terminal tributary of the hepatic vein at the centre of each lobule. At each corner of the hexagonal lobule is a branch of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and biliary tree known as a portal tract or portal triad. Normal hepatic blood flow is 1,500 ml/min (30-40% from the hepatic artery and 60-70% from the portal vein). About two thirds of the liver mass are hepatocytes. The remaining mass is accounted for by the:  Extracellular matrix Cells which line the sinusoids (endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, stellate cells, and pit cells) Bile ducts (biliary epithelial cells), and Blood vessels (vascular endothelial cells).  There are usually three main hepatic veins (left, right and middle), all of which drain directly into the inferior vena cava (IVC). Several additional veins drain directly in to the IVC, including those from the caudate lobe. The veins from the caudate lobe often remain patent in Budd-Chiari syndrome, allowing the caudate lobe to undergo compensatory hyperplasia. The Kupffer cells are the reticulo-endothelial cells of the liver, which are a major functional component of the reticulo-endothelial system."
basic medicine,877,"A 72-year-old woman comes to the Emergency department. She takes warfarin, an anticoagulant for chronic atrial fibrillation, and is usually on a stable warfarin dose of 5 mg every morning.

Pharmacodynamic interactions are those which may increase the propensity to bleeding without actually altering the absorption, metabolism, distribution or excretion of warfarin. Examples include concomitant use of clopidogrel or aspirin in combination with warfarin, or concomitant use of acute therapies like 2b3a receptor antagonists. Pharmacokinetic interactions are those which impact on the absorption, metabolism, distribution or excretion of the drug. Fluoxetine is a CY-P450 enzyme inhibitor. Both inhibitors and inducers of CYP450 enzymes may lead to changes in the anti-coagulant effect of warfarin. Co-prescription of antibiotics often inadvertently leads to increases in INR; examples of antibiotic P450 inhibitors include clarithromycin and erythromycin.   . As per the list of recognised interactions with Warfarin in the BNF Fluoxetine causes a severe risk of increasing ones risk of bleeding. The interactions with Azithromycin is not list even as a minor risk. "

basic medicine,881,A 25-year-old female with a history of type 1 von Willebrand's disease (vWD) is referred for an opinion. She is to have a cervical cone biopsy and the admitting team are concerned about her clotting. You find that she has a past history of menorrhagia and has had two dental extractions as an adolescent that were uncomplicated. What is the most useful test to assess her bleeding tendency?,Activated partial thromboplastin time,Bleeding time,Plasma factor VIII activity,Platelet aggregation,Prothrombin time,C,"In type I vWD the prothrombin time (PT) and platelet aggregation will be normal. Bleeding time, partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and factor VIII-coagulant (FVIIIc) are likely to be abnormal. The bleeding time would be a good screening test but as we already know she has type I vWBD it will not give a quantitative measurement of her bleeding tendency. Similarly APTT will not be that useful. The most useful test in practice is to do the vWB antigen and activity (RICOF); but you would also do FVIIIc as this is also low in vWD."
basic medicine,882,"Regarding the ovary, which of the following is correct?",Disease (tumours) of the ovaries can cause referred pain to the umbilicus,Lies in the ovarian fossa of the lateral pelvic wall behind the caecum,Receives its principal arterial supply from the internal iliac artery,The ovarian ligament is attached to the proximal third of the fallopian tube,The ovarian vessels are contained within the mesovarium,E,"The ovaries lie close to the lateral pelvic walls suspended from the posterior surfaces of the broad ligaments. Each ovary is attached to the broad ligament by a sleeve of peritoneum, the mesovarium, which conveys the ovarian vessels. However, most of the ovarian surface is devoid of peritoneum. The ovary often lies in a hollow, the ovarian fossa, on the lateral pelvic wall between the external and internal iliac vessels. The ureter descends in the posterior boundary of the fossa while the obturator nerve and vessels cross its floor. Therefore, ovarian disease which involves the parietal peritoneum at this site may produce pain referred via the nerve to the medial side of the thigh. The ovarian ligament is attached to the lateral angle of the uterus, inferior to the fallopian tube. The ovary is supplied by the ovarian artery, a direct branch of the abdominal aorta. After crossing the pelvic brim this vessel enters the broad ligament and divides into terminal branches within the mesovarium."

Erythema marginatum is a non-itchy, pale red, macular eruption. It is a major criterion for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever but is also seen in acute glomerulonephritis and drug reactions. Erythema chronicum migrans is an expanding annular lesion occurring in Lyme disease. Erythema nodosum is characterised by tender red swellings usually over the shins. The most common cause is streptococcal infection. Tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, leprosy, sulphonamides and inflammatory bowel disease are other important causes. Erythema multiforme is characterised by cutaneous 'target' lesions and mucosal involvement. Children and young adults are more commonly affected. Orf, mycoplasma, and herpes simplex are among the known causes. Erythema gyratum repens is an erythema forming repeated concentric rings; often there is an underlying malignancy. Erythema induratum is a persistent or recurring cutaneous condition associated with past or active tuberculosis."

The Kell, Duffy and Kidd systems can cause both haemolytic transfusion reactions and the haemolytic disease of the newborn. The P and MN systems can also cause both of these reactions, but they are rare events. The Lutheran, Lewis, Scianna and Li systems are clinically of less importance because they do not cause the haemolytic disease of the newborn, and are unlikely to (or rarely) cause haemolytic transfusion reactions."

basic medicine,889,"In the hand, which is correct?",Digital nerves lie on median plane of fingers,Dislocation of lunate bone may compress ulnar nerve,Opposition of thumb tests opponens pollicis,Palmar aponeurosis attaches to subcutaneous fat,Ulnar bursa communicates with wrist joint,C,"The digital nerves run both medially and laterally along each finger, hence finger blocks are achieved by injecting local anaesthetic along the sides of the fingers. Dislocation of the lunate is the commonest of all carpal dislocations, and a missed diagnosis may result in a median nerve palsy. The principal action of opponens pollicis is opposition of the thumb (pulls thumb medially and forward across the palm). The palmar aponeurosis is attached firmly to the overlying skin, the result of which improves the grip and protects the underlying tendons. The ulnar bursa (synovial sheath of the profundus and superficialis tendons) does not communicate with the wrist joint."

What metabolic abnormality is the most important to monitor for?,Hyponatraemia,Hypomagnesaemia,Hypophosphataemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypokalaemia,C,"When a patient if re fed after prolonged malnourishment then when carbohydrate is given the insulin secretion leads to hypophosphataemia as it leads to phosphate and glucose being taken up by cells. Hypophosphataemia can lead to neurological abnormalities and can lead to confusion, seizures, and coma and muscle weakness can occur, It can ultimately lead to impaired cardiac contractility."
basic medicine,897,Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment of renal osteodystrophy?,Alfacalcidol and calcium supplement,Ergocalciferol and calcium supplementation,Colecalciferol and calcium supplementation,Calcium supplementation,Erythropoietin,A,In renal osteodystrophy there is hypocalcaemia secondary to reduced vitamin D hydroxylation. There is also increased PTH. Alfacalcidol should be utilised rather than the other vitamin D analogues as there is reduced action of 1 hydroxylase in the kidneys. Alfacalcidol is 1 alpha hydroxy vitamin D and does not require hydroxylation by the kidneys to be active whilst the others contain cholecalciferol which require renal hydroxylation before they are active. Calcium aids in binding the excess phosphate which occurs due to failure of its excretion.

basic medicine,903,"A 52-year-old Afro-Caribbean gentleman is diagnosed with hypertension after having three blood pressure measurements greater than 160/100 mmHg. On examination his BMI is 24 kg/m^2, and he looks well. There is no significant past medical history of note. According to the NICE guidelines, which of the following is the most appropriate to prescribe first line for this patient?",Amlodipine,Atenolol,Diltiazem,Ramipril,Valsartan,A,"Patients of African origin are more likely to have low renin hypertension. This means that they are more likely to respond to initial therapy with either a calcium antagonist or diuretic, usually a thiazide. A number of studies have shown that although both amlodipine and diltiazem are well tolerated, amlodipine is more effective in reducing systolic and diastolic blood pressures over a range of doses widely used in clinical practice. Thiazides and beta blockers have been implicated in a meta-analysis as being associated with increased risk of developing insulin resistance, but given his BMI is in the normal range this is unlikely to be a significant problem. In contrast those patients of Caucasian origin who tend to have higher levels of renin respond much more readily to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, or if they fail to tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of cough, to an angiotensin receptor blocker. For these patients, ACE inhibition is seen by NICE as the first line treatment. Combination therapies were designed originally around the ABCD guidelines from the British Hypertension Society, but because of the analysis which suggested increased risk of diabetes when beta blockade is combined with a thiazide, the combination of these two is no longer recommended. Following the ASCOT study however, the ACE inhibitor calcium antagonist combination has been the one preferred by many clinicians. "
basic medicine,904,Which is true regarding cerebral blood flow?,"In hypertension, the cerebral autoregulation curve is shifted to the left",Is approximately 50 ml/100 g/min,Is increased in hypothermia,Is reduced by hypercapnoea,Remains constant between systolic blood pressures of 60-130 mmHg,B,"Cerebral blood flow (CBF) is approximately 50 ml/100 g of brain tissue per minute and is maintained at this constant rate over a wide range of mean arterial pressures (not systolic blood pressures). This phenomenon is called autoregulation, and occurs between mean arterial pressures (MAP) of 60-130 mmHg. The autoregulation curve for cerebral blood flow is shifted to the right (not left) with hypertension, and is lost around areas of diseased brains. Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature below 35°C and is associated with a reduction in CBF. Hypercapnoea causes cerebral vasodilatation which increases CBF. In hypocapnoea, the CBF falls due to cerebral vasoconstriction (e.g. a reduction in PaCO2 from 5 kPa to 4 kPa (40-30 mmHg), results in a 30% fall in blood flow). CBF increases when the PaO2 falls below 6.7 kPa (50 mmHg) and is doubled at a PaO2 of 4 kPa (30 mmHg)."

In a 79-year-old arteriopath diclofenac is best avoided for fear of renal damage. It is now contraindicated for use in those with heart disease which must be assumed in a patient with limb ischaemia. Epidural analgesia may confer benefits, especially pre-operatively for below knee amputation and would be appropriate if the operation were to be delayed. However with platelets of 67 ×10^9/L most anaesthetists would be reluctant to site one. Femoral nerve block is a relatively simple procedure which may help, but will give incomplete cover (not much efect on ischaemic foot pain) and will only provide transient pain relief. A morphine PCA would be appropriate if the patient was unable to take analgesia orally or if oral opiates proved ineffective. A PCA is generally only used for a short period but would be suitable for pain relief before and after the amputation as the delay before surgery should be short."
basic medicine,912,You are examining the mechanisms of various agents used in either platelet inhibition or anticoagulation in the management of cardiovascular disease. Which of the following correctly describes a mechanism of action associated with warfarin therapy?,2b3a receptor inhibition,Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition,P2Y12 inhibition,Vitamin K antagonist.,Selective COX-2 inhibition,D,"Warfarin inhibits production of factors II, VII, IX and X, and it does this by restricting the activity and availability of vitamin K. This accounts for vitamin K administration being the treatment for warfarin toxicity. 2b3a receptor inhibitors are used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and they inhibit platelet aggregation. P2Y12 is an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) dependent receptor involved in platelet aggregation which is inhibited by clopidogrel. Cyclo-oxygenase inhibition is the mechanism of action of aspirin. Selective COX-2 inhibitors have fallen out of favour due to potential increased risk of cardiovascular events."

It originates at the umbilicus and passes caudally towards the liver. It carries within it the ligamentum teres, which is the remnant of the fetal umbilical vein. The coronary ligament is the largest ligament of the liver and forms an attachment between the liver and inferior surface of the diaphragm. It is made up of anterior and posterior leaflets and these diverge on the upper surface of the liver to form the left and right triangular ligaments. The ligamentum venosum is the embryological remnant of the ductus venosus, which acted as a shunt between the umbilical vein and inferior vena cava to bypass the liver in the fetal circulation."

basic medicine,923,At the end of surgery you notice an area of burn near the attached diathermy plate. The diathermy plate seems to be partially detached. Which of the following would be the most likely aetiology?,High voltage was used,The power output was accidentally turned up,The surgeon may have accidently touched the instrument to the patient’s thigh,The injury may have resulted from insulation failure,"Due to the plate not being secured properly, the current density was concentrated in the smaller area where the plate was attached",E,"The answer is Due to the plate not being secured properly, the current density was concentrated in the smaller area where the plate was attached. The amount of thermal damage is dependent upon the current density and the size of the current. The current density in the tip of the needle will be very high as the current is concentrated in the small point. The plate used for the return electrode in monopolar diathermy has a larger surface area of contact, resulting in a much lower current density. Any thermal effect is therefore widely dissipated.

basic medicine,929,"A 65-year-old lady presents with weight loss, lethargy and lower limb weakness. She is now unable to mobilise without assistance and complains of some urinary incontinence. On examination she is cachectic and there is a fungating mass in her left breast. She is able to move her hips but has quadriceps wasting and fasciculation bilaterally. Knee jerks are normal but ankle reflexes are increased. She has power 3/5 for dorsiflexion and extension of the knee and ankles with evidence of clonus and positive Babinski sign. She has reduced anal tone and saddle paraesthesia. What is the diagnosis?",Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,Brown-Sequard syndrome,Cauda equina syndrome,Conus medullaris syndrome,Subacute combined degeneration of the cord,D,"This lady has breast cancer which is disseminated and gone to her spine to cause compression. There is compression of the conus medullaris to give her a mixture of upper and lower motor signs (LMN). Because of the anatomy of the spinal cord if there is compression at the level of the conus medullaris some of the cord is compressed to cause upper motor (UMN) signs and some of the nerves are compressed to give lower motor signs.  Cauda equina would give just LMN signs, and so she would not have positive Babinski sign and clonus. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is the commonest form of motor neurone disease. There would be a mixture of UMN and LMN signs; however they do not have any sensory signs or incontinence. Brown-Sequard syndrome is due to hemisection of the cord and so the patient will have UMN signs in one leg and loss of pain and temperature sensation in the contralateral leg. Subacute combined degeneration of the cord is due to degeneration of the posterior and lateral spinal columns. It can cause bilateral spastic paresis with loss of vibration sensation, tingling and positive Babinski's sign. It is due to B vitamin deficiency or Friedreich's ataxia."
basic medicine,930,It has been suggested that cystic fibrosis (CF) (autosomal recessive) has a high prevalence in some populations because heterozygotes are resistant to the effects of chloride-secreting diarrhoea. This is best described as an example of which of the following?,Gene flow,Genetic drift,Linkage disequilibrium,Mutation,Natural selection,E,"Natural selection is the likely explanation as it appears that heterozygous for CF may offer some protection against diarrhoeal illnesses particularly cholera. Natural selection is defined as the process whereby organisms possessing certain characteristics that make them better adjusted to the environment tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers, and are therefore able to transmit their qualities to succeeding generations. Gene flow (also known as genetic migration) is the transfer of alleles or genes from one population to another. In humans it usually happens following migration (e.g. West African population with European in USA). Genetic drift refers to the statistical drift over time of gene frequencies in a population, due to random sampling effects in subsequent generations. Linkage disequilibrium is the occurence of some combinations of alleles more or less often than would be expected from a random formation of haplotypes. Mutation is a change in genetic sequence."

Hypothyroidism is observed in 30-40% and that suspicion is raised by the gradual weight gain and raised TSH seen here. Her raised ESR, haemoglobin at the lower end of the normal range, and her raised LDH all raise the possibility of lymphoma. Hoarseness, respiratory difficulty and cough can also occur as presenting symptoms. Biopsy is the investigation of choice, but the sample obtained from fine needle aspiration (FNA) alone may not be sufficient to come to a conclusion on architecture. The commonest types of thyroid lymphoma are:  Large cell Follicular, and MALT.  Hodgkin's would often present with weight loss and B symptoms with lymphadenopathy Graves' presents with weight loss and signs of hyperthyroidism Hashimoto's usually presents with a painful thyroid gland after viral infection."
basic medicine,941,"A 17-year-old male who appears tall and thin for his age, presents with a high arch palate, chest wall deformities and livedo reticularis. Which of the following is also associated with this syndrome?",Autosomal dominance,Methionine accumulation,Osteopetrosis,Normal Guthrie test,Upward dislocation of the lens,B,"This syndrome is most likely to be homocystinuria. Marfan's syndrome is associated with upward dislocation of the lens, but not with livedo reticularis, which is seen in Homocystinuria due to the venous thrombosis in the small vessels of the skin. Homocystinuria is associated with downward dislocation of the lens, and is an autosomal recessive disorder. Osteoporosis, and not osteopetrosis is seen in homocystinuria. Homocystinuria is now screened for on the Guthrie test, so a normal result would be unlikely in this condition. Reduced activity of cystathionine-synthase results in accumulation of homocysteine and methionine, interfering with collagen cross-linking, which is the cardinal feature of Homocystinuria."

basic medicine,947,Which one of the following statements regarding the blood brain barrier is correct?,Glucose transport is a passive process,It contains the foot processes of astrocytes,It enhances the transport of hydrophilic molecules,It includes the pineal gland,"It only allows one-way transport, from the vascular system into the brain",B,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a physical barrier partitioning the vasculature of the central nervous system (CNS) and the CNS itself. The capillary membrane of the cerebral capillaries is relatively impermeable to most of the low molecular weight solutes present in blood (as well as to the plasma proteins). However blood borne solutes which are lipophilic, such as ethanol and caffeine, have a low affinity to plasma protein, and will easily cross the BBB. Transport for different molecules is a two-way process. Glucose transport is an active process. Continuous capillaries occur most commonly in the brain and consist of a single layer of endothelial cells connected by tight junctions. The tight junctions provide a barrier to passive diffusion. It is thought that the direct contact between endothelial cells and the foot processes of astrocytes is at least partially responsible for the development of these tight intercellular junctions. The pineal gland is outside the blood brain barrier."

basic medicine,972,Adult and paediatric airways differ in which of the following?,A Macintosh laryngoscope is preferred in neonates,Adult intubation requires the tip of the laryngoscope to be anterior to the epiglottis and in a child behind the epiglottis,The angle of the tracheal bifurcation is greater in an adult,The larynx of a child is lower and more posterior,The soft tissues of a child's oropharynx are large compared to the oral cavity making intubation easier,B,"Anatomical differences between adults and children must be considered during intubation. For instance the angle of tracheal bifurcation is greater and the main bronchi come off at the same angle in children, whereas in adults the right main bronchus is more vertical and therefore more prone to inadvertent intubation. However, children have comparatively larger soft tissues including a floppy epiglottis. The larynx of a child is higher and more anterior than in the adult. In paediatric intubation a straight bladed laryngoscope (that is, McCoy) is placed behind the epiglottis holding it in position, so that it may be lifted to expose the slightly more anterocaudal placed cords. In adults a curved Macintosh blade, with the tip in the vallecula, anterior to the epiglottis is used."
basic medicine,973,Which of the following histopathological subtypes is essential for successful treatment with cetuximab?,Her-2/neu negative,Her-2/neu positive,K-ras mutated,K-ras wild-type,VEGF overexpression,D,Cetuximab works by blocking the extracellular domain of EGFR preventing ligand binding and therefore preventing downstream signal transduction.

The patient will show either distress in excess of that expected or a disruption of their day to day life. The criteria for diagnosing generalised anxiety disorder are anxiety/tension, occasionally accompanied by physical symptoms, on more days than not for more than six months. It is more a diagnosis of exclusion however, as it may be due to prescription medication or another psychiatric illness. Anxiety disorders can be treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). Benzodiazepines and beta blockers can be used on a PRN basis for patients who suffer with panic attacks. Cognitive behavioural therapy can also be of help.

basic medicine,991,"In the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, what is the mechanism of action of ezetimibe?",Inhibit hepatic secretion of VLDL,Prevent cholesterol absorption from the intestine,Reduced cholesterol synthesis through inhibition of the enzyme HMG CoA reductase,Reduced expression of LDL receptors in the liver surface,Stimulate increased action of the enzyme lipoprotein lipase,B,"Ezetimibe reduces the absorption of cholesterol through the gut. Although its exact mechanism of action is unclear, it probably downregulates proteins in the brush border of enterocytes to reduce lipid absorption. Unlike bile acid sequestrants, ezetimibe is systemically absorbed. Ezetimibe is a useful medication for patients who are:  intolerant of statins failing targets on statins alone, and have a history of serious adverse events with statin use.  When used as a monotherapy at a dose of 10 mg daily, ezetimibe reduces LDL cholesterol by around 20%. Increasing the dose further generally does not improve efficacy. When used in conjunction with statins much greater LDL cholesterol reductions are seen."
basic medicine,992,A suspicious neck lesion biopsy reveals a hamartoma. Which of the following is correct with regard to hamartomas?,Adenoma sebaceum seen in tuberous sclerosis is a type of hamartoma,Contains cells from all three germ layers,Contains metaplastic cell types,Does not predispose to malignancy,Usually develop in adolescents,A,"The term hamartoma refers to an abnormal growth that consists of the same tissue from which it is derived. There may be variations in cellular numbers and cellular structure may be disorganised. Studies seem to indicate that a hamartoma occurs when the tissue in the growth did not develop completely. They are usually present at birth. Hamartomas may occur throughout the body, but are often found in the head and neck, particularly around the ears. If hamartomas occur in multiple sites throughout the body, their presence is called Cowden disease. By definition there is no metaplasia in hamartomata. There is evidence that polyps in Peutz-Jeghers, which are hamartomas, may progress to adenocarcinomas of the stomach, duodenum or colon and bronchial hamartomas may transform into carcinoma."

Where should the surgeon compress?",Anterior wall of the foramen of Winslow,Caudate lobe of the liver,First part of the duodenum,Fundus of the gallbladder,Posterior wall of the foramen of Winslow,A,"Pringle's manoeuvre is when the surgeon compresses the hepatic artery where it lies in the anterior wall of the foramen of Winslow. The cystic artery can be damaged in gallbladder surgery. The cystic artery is a branch of the right hepatic artery. The cystic artery must be identified during cholecystectomy; it normally lies in the triangle formed by the inferior surface of the liver, cystic duct and common hepatic duct, also known as Calot's triangle. Bleeding is one of the indications for converting from a laparoscopic to an open cholecystectomy."
basic medicine,996,Enzyme that catalyses the rate-limiting step in bilirubin synthesis,Catalase,Heme oxygenase,Bilirubin synthetase,Cytochrome P450,Cyclo-oxygenase,B,"Bilirubin metabolism∙ Bilirubin (unconjugated / ‘indirect’) is produced from the breakdown of red blood cells∙ The hemoglobin released is broken down to heme the globin chains are converted to amino acids∙ Heme is converted to unconjugated bilirubin in the reticuloendothelial cells of the spleen∙ In the first step, heme is converted to biliverdin by the action of heme oxygenase, the rate-limiting step inthe process. Iron and carbon monoxide are released.∙ Carbon monoxide is excreted through the lungs and can be measured as an index of to bilirubinproduction.∙ In-utero, bilirubin crosses the placenta by passive diffusion, and excretion of bilirubin from the fetusoccurs through the mother∙ Approximately 75% of bilirubin is derived from hemoglobin, but degradation of myoglobin, cytochromes,and catalase also contributes∙ Unconjugated bilirubin is insoluble and is transported in the circulation bound to albumin∙ In the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzymeglucuronyltransferase, making it water-soluble∙ Bilirubin-glucuronide is excreted in bile. In the large bowel, conjugated bilirubin is metabolised by bacteriainto urobilinogen and then to stercobilin which gives faeces its brown colour∙ Some of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed and excreted in the urine∙ Bilirubin levels are higher in neonates than in adults because:∙ Neonatal red cells have a shorter lifespan∙ Neonates have a higher haematocrit∙ Neonatal hepatic enzyme systems are immature and less effective at metabolizing bilirubin. Glucuronyltransferase activity in neonatal liver is 0.1 – 1% that in adult liver but increases to adult values by 4-8weeks of age∙ There is increased entero-hepatic circulation of bilirubin in the neonate.

It is the common pathway for the oxidation of carbohydrate, fat and some amino acids, required for the formation of high energy phosphate bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP).Pyruvate enters the mitochondria and is converted into acetyl‐CoA, which represents the formation of a two carbon molecule from a three carbon molecule (with the loss of one CO2 and the formation of one NADH molecule). Acetyl‐CoA is then condensed with the anion of a four carbon acid, oxaloacetate, to form citrate which is a six carbon molecule.Citrate is subsequently converted into isocitrate, alpha‐ketoglutarate, succinyl‐CoA, succinate, fumarate, malate and finally oxaloacetate.Alpha‐ketoglutarate is the only five carbon molecule in the cycle."

Although it can be triggered by a primary respiratory infection (e.g. pneumonia), ARDS is more often a sequelae of sepsis or of major trauma. The definition of ARDS requires that the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is less than 18 mmHg, or there is no evidence of raised left atrial pressure. Overtransfusion, cardiomyopathy and acute myocardial infarction will cause respiratory distress with an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and therefore are excluded as causes of ARDS. Reperfusion injury and cardiopulmonary bypass are known causes of ARDS."
basic medicine,1001,Which of the following statements regarding phenylketonuria is correct?,Inheritance is X linked recessive,Is classically due to deficiency of tyrosine hydroxylase,Learning difficulties do not occur if the patient adheres to a phenylalanine free diet,Serum tyrosine levels are typically low,Urinary phenylalanine metabolites are typically high,E,"Phenylketonuria (PKU) is the result of hyperphenylalaninaemia. It is autosomal recessive, with a prevalence of 1:10-20,000 live births. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid. Dietary phenylalanine is not utilised for protein synthesis, but is normally degraded via the tyrosine pathway. Failure of this results in other metabolites that cause brain damage. Deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase (chromosome 12) or of the cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (genes on chromosome 10 and 4) causes accumulation of phenylalanine in body fluids. The affected infant is usually normal at birth, and although blood phenylalanine levels may rise as early as four hours after birth, mlearning difficulties develops gradually, and may not be apparent for a few months. About 25% of infants have seizures, but over 50% have an abnormal EEG. Microcephaly, prominent maxilla, growth retardation, and wide-spaced teeth are found in untreated children. Even with dietary treatment some degree of cognitive impairment is seen, and can vary from gross impairment or changes detected on cognitive tests. Cerebral white matter changes are seen in older patients and may reflect a combination of late diagnosis and dietary indiscretion. Diagnosis of classic PKU requires raised Phe levels, increased urinary Phe metabolites and normal cofactor (tetrahydrobiopterin) concentrations. The plasma levels of tyrosine are difficult to measure, and have been shown by a number of studies to have diurnal variation. Whilst the levels are often low in patients with PKU, the levels can be normal depending on what time of the day the sample is taken and whether or not the patients are being treated."

basic medicine,1026,Which is correct regarding wound healing?,Delayed primary healing is characterised by a scar with reduced tensile strength,Healing by secondary intention occurs by both wound contraction and epithelialisation,Myofibroblasts play no role in secondary healing,"Secondary closure is recommended for clean, surgical wounds",Split-thickness skin graft sites heal by first intention,B,"Primary healing (healing by first intention) occurs when a wound is closed within hours of its creation as in clean surgical wounds. In delayed primary healing, as seen in a contaminated or poorly delineated wound (for example, bites, trauma), the skin and subcutaneous tissues are left unapposed and closure is performed after a few days. Collagen metabolism is usually undisturbed and hence the wound retains its tensile strength as if closure had been immediate. Grossly contaminated wounds are left to heal by secondary healing (healing by second intention) when the wound closes by both wound contraction and epithelialisation.Myofibroblasts are thought to play a key role in this type of healing. They appear in the wound approximately three days after wounding and increase in number to a maximal level between the 10^th and 21^st day.

Her blood pressure is normal and tests reveal normal prolactin levels, a raised 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone level and high testosterone levels. What is the diagnosis?",Severe 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency,Severe 21 hydroxylase deficiency,5 Alpha reductase deficiency,Mild 11 beta hydroxylase deficiency,Mild 21 hydroxylase deficiency,E,"This child has congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to mild 21 hydroxylase deficiency. This enzyme normally transforms intermediate molecules into cortisol and aldosterone. Deficiencies of these hormones result in adrenal hyperplasia and raised ACTH. Raised ACTH stimulates the further production of intermediate molecules including 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone which can be measured for diagnosis. The excess 17 alpha hydroxyprogesterone speeds up the synthesis of androgens. Symptoms can include virilisation, hypertension, vomiting and dehydration, amenorrhoea and ambiguous genitalia. The extent of the symptoms depends on the degree of enzyme deficiency. A mild deficiency will cause mild androgen effects which typically occur in later childhood years such as precocious puberty. Severe deficiency results in ambiguous genitals, virilisation of females and symptoms of deranged salt levels."

Ninety per cent of patients have antibodies against the post-synaptic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Sixty five per cent of patients with myasthenia gravis have hyperplasia of the thymus and 12% have a thymoma. Treatment is with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, for example, pyridostigmine, which may cause a cholinergic crisis in over-dosage. Side effects of treatment include:  Diarrhoea Urinary frequency Miosis Excessive salivation, and Lacrimation.  A myasthenic crisis (sudden worsening and spreading weakness) may be provoked by drug omission, infection and stress. Pre-operative assessment of respiratory function is important. Pyridostigmine is usually withheld on the morning of surgery and then restarted in reduced dosage post-operatively. A tracheostomy does improve weaning from ventilatory support, but it is not performed routinely after a thymectomy. These patients are often extubatable within 24 hours on the ICU if not immediately after the surgery."

Resuscitation should be ongoing as he is taken to theatre. The aim is to maintain blood pressure at systolics of around 100 mm Hg which should restore renal perfusion. This level is thought to minimize further bleeding by maintaining clot at the site of leak, whereas normal blood pressures will increase transmural pressures across the aneurysmal sac and cause further bleeding. Patients with aneurysms should not be induced for intubation until in theatre with a surgeon ready to operate on a prepared and draped patient. Relaxation of the abdominal muscles can decrease the tamponading effect of the abdominal wall and result in sudden loss of cardiac output. This man is highly likely to suffer from renal failure regardless of pre-operative measures."

They are thought to have a familial tendency and are seen 5-15 times more frequently in non-whites. Hypertrophic scars are confined to the borders of the original wound, but keloids extend beyond the original scar margins. Whilst anatomical locations such as genitalia, eyelids, palms and soles are usually spared, keloids are more common in wounds that cross tension lines and in areas such as the earlobe, presternal and deltoid regions. Hypertrophic scars generally begin to develop in the weeks after injury, whereas keloids can develop up to one year later. Various treatment modalities including surgical excision have been tried, but no treatment, at present, seems to be curative for keloids. Intralesional steroid therapy and pressure therapy are useful to keep the lesion under control."

Which of the following treatments is indicated?,Graded exercise therapy,Group therapy,Prednisolone,Seroxat,Thyroxine,A,"NICE have published guidance on the diagnosis and management of Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy) (CG53). To confirm a diagnosis of fatigue the following main features need to be present:  It must be new in onset, persistent or recurrent and unexplained by other conditions. It should be characterised by post-exertional malaise. It should result in a substantial reduction in activity level.  Associated symptoms include:  Hypersomnia or insomnia Muscle or joint pain without inflammation  Painful lymph nodes without lymphadenopathy Headaches Cognitive dysfunction.  Red flag symptoms which suggest another diagnosis include:  Significant weight loss Inflammatory arthropathy or connective tissue disease Localising or focal neurological signs.  The diagnosis of CFS is one of exclusion, and features must have been present for at least four months in an adult. Clinicians should check:  Full blood count (FBC) Urea and electrolytes (Uandamp;Es) Urinalysis Liver function tests (LFTs) Thyroid function Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) C reactive protein (CRP) Blood glucose Creatinine Gluten sensitivity calcium Creatinine kinase, and Ferritin.  Initial treatment should focus on management of symptoms, and minimising their impact on daily activities. Patients must be encouraged to continue work and studies. Any therapy should be person-centred and should aim to improve the patient's capacity to manage their symptoms. The majority of research evidence is for cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and/or graded exercise therapy and these should be offered to all people with mild or moderate CFS. In addition, patients should be given tailored sleep management advice including how to introduce rest periods into their daily routine. Relaxation techniques should be offered for the management of pain, sleep problems, stress and anxiety. There is no research evidence to support the experience of some patients with CFS that they are more intolerant of drug treatment. In addition, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of complementary therapies or vitamin supplementation. The following drugs should not be used:  Monoamine oxidase inhibitors Glucocorticoids Mineralocorticoids Dexamphetamine Thyroxine Antivirals.  Referral to specialist CFS care should be offered within six months of presentation to people with mild CFS, within three to four months for moderate CFS and immediately for severe CFS. If chronic pain is a predominant feature, referral to a pain management clinic should be considered. Amitriptlyline should be considered for patients with poor sleep or pain. Patients should be advised that relapses and setbacks are to be expected."

He is admitted after his third fraction of radiotherapy with severe community acquired pneumonia and admitted to a lead-lined side-room on an oncology ward. Unfortunately he deteriorates and you are fast-bleeped to attend as he is peri-arrest due to impending respiratory failure. What radiation precautions should you take before entering the room?,Lab to be informed that bloods are taken from a patient receiving external beam radiotherapy,Do not enter the room unless the patient arrests,None,Pregnant women not to enter the room,Wear a lead-lined apron and disposable gloves,C,"Much confusion surrounds the use of radiotherapy, especially how patients are cared for on the ward. It is critical to distinguish between whether the patient has had external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy or use of an unsealed source. External beam radiotherapy or use of targeted intraoperative radiotherapy does not render the patient radioactive. Use of brachytherapy methods usually involves insertion of radioactive seeds or beads which may require some radiation protection precautions. The exact precautions to be taken depend on the site, and the source used. If you are dealing with these patients you should ensure you are clear on the local radiation protection guidelines.  Use of an unsealed source, for example radio-iodine treatment of thyroid cancer or hyperthyroidism, has substantial need for precautions and patients need to be isolated in a lead-lined side room, often for several days. In this case the patient is not radioactive and needs emergency care immediately. It is likely he is in a lead-lined side room as this is the only room available on the ward and he should be treated no differently to any other patient. No precautions need to be taken with his blood."

They run posterior to the ovarian vessels. There are three sites of anatomic constriction:  Pelvo-ureteric conjunction Where the ureter crosses the pelvic brim, and Vesico-ureteric junction.  The ureters cross below the uterine arteries near the cervix."
basic medicine,1077,A 72-year-old female is diagnosed with giant cell arteritis and is treated with prednisolone 60 mg per day. What is the most appropriate treatment for the prevention of steroid induced osteoporosis?,Alendronic acid,Calcium,Raloxifene,Tibolone,Vitamin D,A,"Oral glucocorticoids are associated with significant increase in fracture risk, from doses as low as 5mg daily. Loss of bone-mineral density is greatest in the first few months of glucocorticoid therapy, but fracture risk declines rapidly after stopping. There is an increased risk of fracture over and above the effect of low bone mineral density. Patients older than 65 years are considered at high risk of osteoporotic fractureas are those with a prior fragility fracture, and they should commence on bone-protective therapy at the time of starting glucocorticoid therapy. Measurement of bone density is not required before starting therapy. In patients younger than 65 years without risk factors, DEXA scan is recommended for assessment of fracture risk. General measures to reduce bone loss include use of the lowest dose of glucocorticoids possible, and steroid-sparing agents. Dietary calcium should be increased and physical activity, with smoking and alcohol minimised. Daily intake 1,500 mg of calcium and 800U of vitamin D3 is recommended. Bone-protective therapy which can be used includes:  alendronate alfacalcidol calcitonin calcitriol cyclic etidronate, and risedronate.  Bisphosphonates are generally considered first line. If unsuitable, then calcitriol or strontium ranelate may be considered. Raloxifene is an selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that has oestrogenic actions and anti-oestrogenic actions on the uterus and breast. It can be used in the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis where bisphosphonates are not suitable, but not commonly in steroid-induced osteoporosis. Tibolone is a form of hormone-replacement therapy which can be used in post-menopausal women. However, it should not be considered first-line therapy, and is only used where other therapies are contra-indicated, not tolerated, or there is a lack of response."

Normal saline has a pH of 5 and may produce a mild metabolic acidosis with significant infusions. Ileostomy may be associated with a loss of bicarbonate ions and hence acidosis. Mineralocorticoid excess (Conn's syndrome) is also associated with a metabolic alkalosis. Salicylates are themselves acidic and produce a metabolic acidosis. "
basic medicine,1082,Which of the following is correct of the pituitary gland?,Is located close to the floor of the third ventricle,Lies in the pituitary fossa which is located in the ethmoid bone,Secretion of hormones from the posterior lobe is controlled by hypothalamic inhibitory and releasing factors,The anterior lobe secretes vasopressin and oxytocin,"Vasopressin is produced, stored and secreted by the pituitary gland",A,"The pituitary gland lies in the pituitary fossa which is located in the sphenoid bone and lies close to the floor of the third ventricle. It can be functionally divided into anterior and posterior lobes. The anterior lobe secretes the following:  Growth hormone Prolactin Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) Thyrotropin Lutenising hormone (LH), and Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH).  The secretion of these hormones is controlled by releasing and inhibitory factors released by the hypothalamus. Oxytocin and vasopressin are secreted from the posterior lobe (not anterior) of the pituitary. Oxytocin is released in response to suckling and also cervical dilatation during childbirth. Vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone) is a neuropeptide which is synthesised in the cell bodies of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei (not in the pituitary). It is then transported down their axons to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland from which it is secreted. Vasopressin secretion is controlled by changes in osmolarity. These are detected by hypothalamic osmoreceptors. Vasopressin release also occurs with large changes in blood volume (greater than5-10%)."

basic medicine,1094,"A 79-year-old gentleman is admitted with a history of nocturia, frequency, poor flow, hesitancy and terminal dribbling; and retention due to benign prostatic hypertrophy is diagnosed. Insertion of a catheter drains 2000 ml. Whilst awaiting urological review, a check U and E has shown that his sodium level has increased from 138 mmol/L on admission to 155 mmol/L (137-144) and his potassium is unchanged at 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-4.9). He has been normotensive throughout his admission. What is the likely cause of this finding?",Cardiac failure,Cirrhosis,Cushing's syndrome,Nephrotic syndrome,Post-obstruction diuresis,E,"The likely diagnosis is post-obstruction diuresis during which, in addition to hypernatraemia, there is also an increased urinary loss of sodium (urinary sodium more than 30 mmol/L). In Cushing's syndrome the hypernatraemia is usually associated with hypokalaemia and hypertension and thus is unlikely in this scenario. The remaining options are all causes of hyponatraemia."

basic medicine,1096,The right ureter lies in close relationship to which of the following?,Bifurcation of the aorta,Inferior mesenteric artery,Infundibulopelvic ligament,Median sacral artery,Parietal attachment of the sigmoid mesocolon,C,"At its origin the right ureter is usually covered by the descending part of the duodenum, and, in its course downward, lies to the right of the inferior vena cava, and is crossed by the right colic and ileocolic vessels. Near the superior aperture of the pelvis it passes behind the lower part of the mesentery and the terminal part of the ileum. The left ureter is crossed by the left colic vessels, and near the superior aperture of the pelvis passes behind the sigmoid colon and its mesentery. The ureter forms, as it lies in relation to the wall of the pelvis, the posterior boundary of a shallow depression named the ovarian fossa, in which the ovary is situated. The ureter is posterior to the infundibulopelvic ligament - the fibrous suspensory ligament of the ovary - which contains the ovarian vessels and nerves. It then runs medially and forward on the lateral aspect of the cervix uteri and upper part of the vagina to reach the fundus of the bladder. In this part of its course it is accompanied for about 2.5 cm by the uterine artery, which then crosses in front of the ureter and ascends between the two layers of the broad ligament. The ureter is distant about 2 cm from the side of the cervix of the uterus. The ureter is sometimes duplicated on one or both sides, and the two tubes may remain distinct as far as the fundus of the bladder. On rare occasions they open separately into the bladder cavity."
basic medicine,1097,Which of the following is true regarding morphine?,Causes direct myocardial depression,Decreases the production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH),Has a lower affinity for the opioid receptor than diamorphine,Is a phenylpiperidine,May cause bronchospasm,E,"Morphine does not causes direct myocardial depression, although it may cause a bradycardia. The hypotension associated with its use is due to the decrease in the systemic vascular resistance (SVR) which is due, in part, to histamine release. The histamine release may also cause bronchospasm. The production of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) is also increased by morphine. Diamorphine has almost no affinity for the opioid receptor, and is a prodrug of morphine. Phenylpiperidines include pethidine and fentanyl, whereas morphine is a phenanthrene."
basic medicine,1098,A 55-year-old teacher who is a member of a local choir has undergone a total thyroidectomy. Post-operatively he complains that his voice is weak and his singing range is reduced. The surgeon visualises his vocal cords which are lying normally. He diagnoses that damage to the superior laryngeal nerve has occurred during surgery. With which blood vessel does it run?,Inferior thyroid artery,Inferior thyroid vein,Middle thyroid vein,Superior thyroid artery,Superior thyroid vein,D,"The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve is the motor supply to the cricothyroid muscle. It lies medially to the superior thyroid artery. Damage to this nerve means that the other muscles will still be working. The vocal cords appear normal. It will result in the patient's voice becoming weak. The singing range may be reduced to one rather than two octaves. The patient may be unable to shout. The recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies motor function to the other muscles of the larynx. If both are damaged, the vocal cords will be in the fully adducted position. If severed completely, they will become paralysed. Bilateral damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves may cause acute respiratory distress requiring intubation or, if unresolved, a tracheostomy. Many such injuries after (usually) bilateral thyroid surgery are transient. Bilateral damage may also render the patient unable to speak."

Which of the following medications would be a contraindication to prescribing sildenafil?,Clopidogrel,GTN spray used once per month,Metoprolol,Nicorandil,Propranolol,D,"The phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors should be avoided in patients taking nitrates or nicorandil. This is due to vasodilatation potentially causing hypotension and precipitating a myocardial event. The gentleman using a GTN spray less than once per week could be prescribed sildenafil, although it is worth warning him that should he have chest pain requiring the Emergency department after having taken sildenafil, he should warn his health care providers so that they can avoid nitrates whilst treating his symptoms. Myocardial infarction is a contraindication to the use of sildenafil; however cardiovascular disease (that is, angina) requires cautious prescribing. Other patients in which PPD5 inhibitors should be used with caution are those with risk of priapism, such as sickle cell or multiple myeloma. None of the other drugs, aspirin, clopidogrel, ACE inhibitors and beta blockers are contraindications to the use of sildenafil."
basic medicine,1102,What type of virus is the Rubella virus?,Double stranded RNA (dsRNA),Retrovirus,Single stranded DNA (ssDNA),Single stranded RNA (ssRNA),Double stranded DNA (dsDNA),D,"Single stranded RNA (ssRNA)Rubella virus is the only member of the genus Rubivirus and is a type of Togavirus (Togaviridae). It is a single stranded RNA virus. Note for the exam if you are unsure - most RNA viruses encountered in clinical practice are single stranded. The exception is rotavirus which is dsRNA virus.

basic medicine,1103,A 78-year-old female presents with a one day history of abdominal distension and vomiting. On examination there is an irreducible lump in the left groin arising below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. A plain abdominal radiograph reveals distended loops of small bowel. Which of the following hernias are most likely to have produced this clinical scenario?,Direct inguinal,Femoral,Incisional,Indirect inguinal,Obturator,B,"This patient has developed a small bowel obstruction. The most likely diagnosis is an obstructed femoral hernia, as the irreducible lump in the left groin arises below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. An inguinal hernia would produce a lump above and medial to the pubic tubercle. Femoral hernias are the third most common hernia with a male to female ratio of 1:4, with the hernia occurring most frequently in elderly multiparous women. All femoral hernias should be repaired, as 40% are strangulated on first presentation. Erythema of the overlying skin occurs in strangulation and is a sign of poor outcome. Obturator hernias are very rare and do not usually present with a lump."
basic medicine,1104,A 53-year-old woman is started on a capecitabine based regime for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma. Which of the following is true of capecitabine?,Capecitabine is more effective than IV agents,Diarrhoea is rarely seen with therapy,It is a way to deliver 5 fluorouracil orally,It is a way to deliver cisplatin orally,It is not effective in the treatment of coloncarcinoma,C,"The answer is that it is a way to deliver 5 fluorouracil orally. Capecitabine is a prodrug, which is metabolised to produce 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapeutic agent used intravenously in the treatment of cancer. Damage to rapidly dividing cells in the GI tract leads to symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting as a result of capecitabine treatment. Studies of efficacy suggest no major differences in clinical remission when capecitabine is compared to 5-fluorouracil given IV."
basic medicine,1105,You see a patient on the ward who is acutely short of breath and perform an ABG. The results are as follows pH 7.25 pO2 8.6 kPA pCO2 8.0 kPa Base Excess +2 What is the acid base disturbance?,Respiratory Acidosis,Respiratory Alkalosis,Mixed alkalosis,Metabolic Acidosis,Metabolic Alkolosis,A,This patient has acidosis as the pH is low The pO2 is irrelevant. The pCO2 is raised i.e. the respiratory system is causing acidosis. The patient is acidotic so this is a respiratory acidosisThe Base Excess is normal. You would typically expect the base excess to rise but metabolic compensation is slower than respiratory compensation so this picture may be seen acutely. Blood Gas Analysis Interpreting Blood Gas ResultsNormal blood pH is 7.35 to 7.45First decide if this is acidosis or alkalosis?pH less than 7.35 is acidosis pH greater than 7.45 is alkalosisThen look at the respiratory and metabolic systemsThe respiratory system is assessed by looking at the pCO2. The metabolic aspect is assessed by Base excess. In pH disturbances typically one system will cause a disturbance and the other will try and correct it e.g. a respiratory acidosis (increased pCO2) will usually prompt a metabolic alkalosis response (increased base excess) and vice versa.Next analyse the pCO2Raised CO2 causes acidosis Low CO2 causes alkalosisYou should now know what kind of disturbance you are dealing with as:If the patient is acidotic i.e. pHIf the patient is acidotic and the pCO2 is low this is metabolic acidosis (the respiratory system is trying to compensate by causing alkalosis but is not the dominant system) If the patient has alkalosis i.e. pH >7.45 and the pCO2 is raised this is a metabolic alkalosis (with respiratory system trying to compensate by causing acidosis) If the patient has alkalosis and the pCO2 is low this is respiratory alkalosis.The exception to the rule is mixed acidosis or alkalosis where both systems are contributing to the same pH disturbance. Now look at the base excess (BE)Normal range for BE is -2 to +2. >+2 the metabolic system is causing alkalosis. The patient will either have a metabolic alkalosis or a respiratory acidosis with some metabolic compensationDisturbance pH pCO2 Base ExcessRespiratory AcidosisElevated (>6.0kPa) Elevated (>+2)Respiratory Alkalosis >7.45 Low ( Low (Metabolic AcidosisLow ( Low (Metabolic Alkalosis >7.45 Elevated Elevated

basic medicine,1115,"A 23-year-old man who presented to the gastroenterology clinic with bloody diarrhoea has been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease after endoscopy and biopsy. Although he has improved significantly with the combination of mesalazine and prednisolone, he now requires a steroid sparing agent, and it is recommended that he start azathioprine. Which of the following tests should be undertaken before starting azathioprine?",Catechol o-methyl transferase (COMT) activity,Chest radiograph,Serum folate,Quantiferon gamma test,Thiopurine methyl transferase (TPMT) activity,E,"The correct answer is TPMT activity. TPMT is the main enzyme responsible for metabolising the active metabolite of azathioprine, (6-mercaptopurine). Naturally occurring polymorphisms which reduce TPMT activity are recognised, and these are associated with significant azathioprine toxicity (especially bone marrow suppression), and testing is therefore recommended before initiating therapy with azathioprine. In patients with reduced TPMT activity, half dose therapy or an alternative can be given. COMT is responsible for degradation of adrenaline, nor-adrenaline and dopamine, and as such is not relevant in this case. Chest radiograph and quantiferon gamma testing can be considered as screening tests for tuberculosis, which should be done before initiation of anti-TNF therapy. Serum folate should be checked prior to starting methotrexate if folate deficiency is suspected."

A decision is made to commence adalimumab therapy. Which of the following correctly reflects the MoA of this treatment?",Costimulation blockade,IL-1 inhibition,IL-6 inhibition,IL-21 inhibition,TNF alpha inhibitor,E,"The answer is TNF alpha inhibitor. Adalimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that forms high affinity, stable complexes with both the soluble and transmembrane bioactive forms of human TNF-α, which prevents the binding of TNF-α to its receptors. It is used in the treatment of conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis / psoriatic arthritis, where TNF-alpha driven inflammation is known to play a major role. As with other agents acting via this pathway, screening for latent TB should be undertaken before therapy is initiated. Costimulation blockade is the target for abatacept, a fusion protein consisting of CTLA-4 and the Fc portion of IgG , which binds to CD80 and CD86 and prevents T-cell activation. IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are both used the treatment of arthritis, examples include canakinumab and siltuximab. Il-21 is an inflammatory cytokine which is elevated in acute viral infection.

She is admitted to hospital and given an intravenous infusion of 5% dextrose. Her serum potassium concentration is noted the following day to have fallen to 1.9 mmol/L (normal range 3.5-4.9, 3.9 on admission). What is the likely mechanism for the fall in potassium concentration?",Cortisol release in response to stress increasing renal potassium loss,Decompensated liver failure causing aldosterone secretion,Intracellular re-uptake in response to re-feeding with glucose,Metabolic acidosis increasing renal potassium excretion,Potassium levels falling following gastric loss in vomiting,C,"Refeeding syndrome is potentially fatal, and occurs when previously malnourished patients are given a carbohydrate load. When malnourished, the body uses endogenous fuel stores for energy and maintains serum electrolytes by redistribution from intracellular spaces. Exogenously administered glucose results in insulin release, and subsequent difficultly for the body in trying to convert to exogenous fuel sources. This results in rapid uptake of glucose, potassium, phosphate and magnesium into cells, with dramatic falls in the extracellular concentrations. Additionally, for reasons which are not well understood, the body begins to retain fluid resulting in expansion of the extracellular space. As a result of these fluid and electrolyte changes, there is an increase in cardiac work which can precipitate acute heart failure. There is also an increase in the respiratory quotient, which can cause dyspnoea and tachypnoea and in extreme cases respiratory failure. Nausea and diarrhoea is also common due to gut intolerance. None of the other options are causes of hypokalaemia in this setting."

basic medicine,1140,You are investigating a new anti-platelet agent which may have additional effects on top of clopidogrel. To investigate the effects of the new therapy you need to be aware of the mode of action of clopidogrel. Which of the following best describes the action of clopidogrel?,5HT-2 receptor inhibition,Cox-1 inhibition,Cox-2 inhibition,Glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibition,Inhibition of the platelet ADP receptor,E,"Clopidogrel inhibits the platelet ADP receptor, which leads to decreased propensity to platelet aggregation and is complementary to cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, which is the action of aspirin. Aspirin is weakly selective for the COX-1 enzyme. Specific COX-2 inihibitors were developed, e.g. rofecoxib, as analgesics and were thought to be associated with reduced risk of peptic ulceration but post-marketing data suggested they were increased with a significantly increased risk of heart attack or stroke and so many have been withdrawn from the market.  5HT-2 receptor inhibition also reduces platelet aggregation; one example is sarpogrelate developed primarily as an alternative to aspirin because of its lower risk of haemorrhage. Glycoprotein IIb IIIa inhibitors are used in patients with unstable angina/NSTEMI, an example being abciximab."
basic medicine,1141,Which of the following is true of low molecular weight (LMW) heparin?,Exerts its anticoagulant effect by binding with Factor VIII,Has a more potent effect on platelets than does unfractionated heparin,Inactivates thrombin more readily than unfractionated heparin,Is excreted in the urine,Is less efficacious compared with unfractionated heparin,D,"By binding to antithrombin, low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) creates a complex, which then binds with and inactivates factor Xa. LMWH binds less to platelets, endothelium and von Willebrand factor, hence less risk of bleeding. The shorter chains are less likely to bind both antithrombin and thrombin (LMW binds Xa more readily). LMHW is excreted in the urine (and partly by hepatic metabolism, though less so than unfractionated). This needs monitoring in renal impairment. LMWH have been shown to be as efficacious, safer and have improved inpatient stay and hospital cost. "

basic medicine,1144,"What is the predominant cell in the wound (first 48 hours), during the inflammatory phase of wound healing?",Fibroblast,Fibroclast,Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs),Macrophages,B-cells,C,"Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs)PMNs responsible of the phagocytosis ofdebris and bacteria and break down damaged tissue. Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs) typically undergo apoptosis after 48 hours. They are then engulfed and degraded by macrophages. Macrophages therefore become the predominant cell type in the wound during the3rd and 4th day.The inflammatory phase is the first phase in wound healing processfibronectin and growth factors attract Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils PMNs to the wound site. Wound healing is typically divided into four phases. The four phases of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase: This is the initial phase that starts immediately after the injury occurs. The body's response involves vasoconstriction and the formation of a blood clot .Inflammatory Phase: Following hemostasis, the inflammatory phase begins and can last for several days. During this phase, the body triggers an inflammatory response to remove debris, foreign substances, and bacteria from the wound. Immune cells, growth factors, and other chemicals are released to initiate the healing process.Proliferative Phase: After the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase starts, lasting for several weeks. New tissue is formed through the action of fibroblasts, which produce collagen, and other cells. The wound is filled with granulation tissue, which contains new blood vessels and collagen.Remodeling Phase: The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase. It can last for several months to years after the injury. During this phase, the collagen fibers reorganize and gain strength, and the wound contracts and becomes smaller. The goal is to improve the wound's tensile strength and functionality, although it may not reach the original strength of the uninjured tissue entirely."
basic medicine,1145,Which of the following is correct of intussusception?,Can be diagnosed by an air contrast enema,Has a peak incidence in infants aged 6-9 weeks,Has an identifiable underlying cause in the majority of children,Results in the early rectal passage of blood stained mucus,Typically results in continuous abdominal pain,A,"Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel is telescoped into another segment of bowel just distal to it. It is the commonest cause of intestinal obstruction in the 3 month to 6 year age group and is more common in males. Symptoms include sudden onset of paroxysmal colicky abdominal pain and vomiting that may progress to shock. The passage of bloody red currant jelly stool is a late feature. This is due to gut wall haemorrhage and oedema. Diagnosis may be achieved by an air-contrast enema, in which the coiled spring appearance of the intussusception may be seen. This can also be therapeutic. Barium can cause problems if it leaks. Intussusceptions tend to occur in areas in which a peristaltic intestine abuts an aperistaltic segment.

If IgM +ve this suggests acute infection or false positive IgM (not uncommon) Rubella Rubella Key PointsCaused by Rubella virus: A togavirus Single-stranded RNA genome Transmission primarily via the respiratory route Viral replication occurs in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes Rubella infection in children and adults usually mild Incubation period range 12-23 days (average 14 days) Congenital rubella infection teratogenic with poor prognosis and significant complications (sensorineural deafness, cataracts and cardiac abnormalities most common) No specific treatment. Key is prevention through vaccination programme Vaccination is via live attenuated virus so cannot be given to pregnant women who are found to be non-immune."
basic medicine,1186,Umbilical hernia in children:,Causes pain and vomiting,Clears spontaneously,Requires surgical treatment because of incarceration,Requires surgical treatment because of psychological problems,Should be strapped,B,Umbilical hernia are common especially in low birth weight and black infants. They are also more common in certain conditions such as Down's syndrome and Beckwith Wiedemann. They appear as a soft swelling and become more obvious with crying or coughing. They are easily reducible. Most appear before the age of 6 months and they resolve spontaneously; 95% resolve by the age of 2 years. Surgery is not required unless the hernia is very large or if it causes symptoms. Strangulation is rare.

basic medicine,1193,"A 4-month-old boy turns up at the clinic after his mother has discovered a lump in the scrotum. On examination the child is well, the lump is smooth and non-tender and the testis is part of the swelling. Which of the following is correct?",He is at risk of epididymo-orchitis,Surgery is indicated soon,The child has a testicular tumour,The lump is likely to be transilluminable,The lump is unlikely to resolve spontaneously,D,This scenario describes a hydrocele in a well 4-month-old child. This is an accumulation of fluid around the testicle within the tunica vaginalis. Most hydroceles resolve spontaneously and therefore do not require surgery. Patients are usually asymptomatic. The swelling is uniformly smooth and fluctuant. The testis cannot be felt separately and transillumination confirms the diagnosis.

basic medicine,1197,Which of the following provides the best description of how alcohol leads to a diuresis?,Reduction of aquaporin 2 channel insertion in apical membrane of distal tubules and collecting ducts,Inhibition of Na-K-2Cl channels,Vasodilation of afferent arteriole,Increased aquaporin 2 channel insertion in apical membrane of distal tubules and collecting ducts,Increased BNP secretion,A,Alcohol leads to a reduced secretion of ADH. ADH results in insertion of Aquaporin 2 channels in apical membrane of distal tubules and collecting ducts and increased water reabsorption and thus a reduction in ADH leads to a diuresis.
basic medicine,1198,"A 30-year-old woman has a right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for a carcinoma diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. The histological pattern is that of a poorly differentiated carcinoma that is negative for oestrogen and progesterone receptors, as well as for for HER-2. One of the sentinel lymph nodes demonstrates a metastasis. Her 32-year-old sister is found to have a similar lesion. Which of the following statements regarding risk factors for this lesion is the most appropriate?",A history of late menarche is likely to be present in females in this family,Fibrocystic changes were present for many years,She had a history of exposure to hydrocarbon compounds,She has a positive antinuclear antibody test,These findings suggest a BRCA-1 mutation,E,A small number of breast cancers are the result of an inherited BRCA-1 mutation (or BRCA-2) but the family history of breast cancer at a young age makes this more likely. Early menarche and late menopause and nulliparity are risks for breast cancer. Autoimmune diseases do not appreciably increase the risk for breast cancer.
basic medicine,1199,What is the most effective bisphosphonate for use in reducing bone pain and preventing pathological fractures in patients with metastatic breast cancer?,Alendronic acid,Ibandronic acid,Olpadronate,Pamidronate,Zoledronic acid,E,Multiple randomised control studies have proven the efficacy of Zometa in treatment of bone metastasis from breast cancer. It is commonly given for six months and if the patient responds then they can be switched to daily ibandronic acid to prevent repeat visits to hospital. Zometa has a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw which must be explained to patients before they are treated. Pamidronate can be used in the treatment of hypercalcaemia of malignancy.

The adenohypophysis develops from ectoderm while the neurohypophysis develops from a neuroectodermal downgrowth from the floor of the third ventricle. The pituitary gland lies in its fossa (sella turcica) which is formed by the body of the sphenoid bone. The diaphragma sellae bounds the gland superiorly and the cavernous sinuses laterally. The optic chiasma lies above and towards the back of the diaphragma sellae. A pituitary tumour, rising upwards, presses on the lower anterior part of the chiasma and the medial sides of the optic nerves resulting in hemianopia."

Bumetanide and furosemide are loop diuretics, blocking reabsorption of sodium at the loop of Henle. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor and has no relation to thiazide-like action. Triamterene is a potassium-sparing diuretic with no thiazide-like activity."
basic medicine,1210,A 21-year-old man who has a past history of IV drug abuse presents 12 hours after taking an overdose of 480 mg of codeine and 30 g of paracetamol. His blood pressure is 100/60 mmHg and he has pin-point pupils. What is the most appropriate management for this patient?,500ml 10% glucose IV over four hours,1 litre normal saline IV over six hours,IV naloxone,IV flumazenil,Start N-acetylcysteine,E,"This patient presents 12 hours after taking a potentially fatally toxic dose of paracetamol. In the circumstances provided in this question where there is an absence of data relating to pulse rate (as he is probably not in shock), respiratory rate (reflecting respiratory depression) or blood glucose, the most appropriate intervention at this 12 hour time-point would be N-acetylcysteine. The urgency of treatment is underlined by the fact that the incidence of hepatotoxicity is worse if treatment is delayed. Trials of N-acetylcysteine suggest that the incidence of hepatotoxicity is 1% in those treated within eight hours as opposed to 46% in those treated after 16 hours."
basic medicine,1211,How do glucocorticoids mediate their effect on the body?,Binds to cell surface receptors and forms heterodimers,Binds to cell surface receptor and activates G proteins resulting in change in gene expression,Binds to extracellular receptor and it is engulfed and travels to nucleus,Hormone receptor complex and via phosphorylation bind to hormone response element on DNA,Hormone receptor complex and via zinc fingers bind to hormone response element on DNA,E,"Glucocorticoids bind to intracellular receptors. The hormone receptor complex once it has been phosphorylated travels to the nucleus and via zinc fingers binds to specific parts of DNA, hormone response elements. Along with other transcription factors there is activation or suppression of gene expression."
basic medicine,1212,"Utilising the posterior approach to perform a nephrectomy, which of the following will the surgeon find?",The perirenal fat is exterior to the renal fascia (of Gerota),The peritoneum needs to be opened,The pleura reaches below the level of the twelfth rib,The renal artery is anterior to the renal vein,The subcostal nerve is anterior to the kidney,C,"The renal artery is posterior to the renal vein. The kidney is retroperitoneal and the perirenal fat is enclosed in the renal fascia. The pleura reach to the line of the lateral arcuate ligament from under which the subcostal nerve emerges, posterior to the kidneys. Whichever approach you use the renal vein will normally be anterior to the renal artery. Occasionally the left renal vein is posterior to the aorta which can make open aortic aneurysm surgery hazardous if you have not looked carefully at the CT scan."
basic medicine,1213,Which of the following statements is true regarding pregnancy following breast cancer?,Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide does not affect future fertility,Early pregnancy loss is more likely,Radiotherapy following mastectomy is associated with premature ovarian failure,Resumption of menstruation following treatment confirms restoration of fertility,Treatment of stage I breast cancer is associated with impaired future fertility,B,"Treatment of early stage I and II breast cancer should not be associated with any detrimental effect on future fertility, but fertility is impaired following chemotherapy. As few as 7% of women are fertile after breast cancer chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide affects resting cells. The resumption of menstruation does not mean that fertility will be unimpaired, although it is a good sign. Chemotherapy following surgery may be associated with premature ovarian failure but not axillary radiotherapy. "
basic medicine,1214,You see a patient on the ward and perform an ABG. The results are as follows pH 7.25 pO2 10.6 kPA pCO2 4.0 kPa Base Excess -17 What is the acid base disturbance?,Metabolic acidosis,Respiratory acidosis,Mixed acidosis,Respiratory alkolosis,Metabolic alkolosis,A,This patient has acidosis as the pH is The pO2 is irrelevant. The pCO2 is low i.e. the respiratory system is trying to alkalise. The patient is acidotic however so this is compensatory. Clinically the patient is 'blowing off' CO2 and clinically would be tachypneic. The Base Excess is negative i.e. the metabolic system is causing acidosis and the patient is acidotic. This is a metabolic acidosis. Blood Gas Analysis Interpreting Blood Gas ResultsNormal blood pH is 7.35 to 7.45First decide if this is acidosis or alkalosis?pH less than 7.35 is acidosis pH greater than 7.45 is alkalosisThen look at the respiratory and metabolic systemsThe respiratory system is assessed by looking at the pCO2. The metabolic aspect is assessed by Base excess. In pH disturbances typically one system will cause a disturbance and the other will try and correct it e.g. a respiratory acidosis (increased pCO2) will usually prompt a metabolic alkalosis response (increased base excess) and vice versa.Next analyse the pCO2Raised CO2 causes acidosis Low CO2 causes alkalosisYou should now know what kind of disturbance you are dealing with as:If the patient is acidotic i.e. pHIf the patient is acidotic and the pCO2 is low this is metabolic acidosis (the respiratory system is trying to compensate by causing alkalosis but is not the dominant system) If the patient has alkalosis i.e. pH >7.45 and the pCO2 is raised this is a metabolic alkalosis (with respiratory system trying to compensate by causing acidosis) If the patient has alkalosis and the pCO2 is low this is respiratory alkalosis.The exception to the rule is mixed acidosis or alkalosis where both systems are contributing to the same pH disturbance. Now look at the base excess (BE)Normal range for BE is -2 to +2. >+2 the metabolic system is causing alkalosis. The patient will either have a metabolic alkalosis or a respiratory acidosis with some metabolic compensationDisturbance pH pCO2 Base ExcessRespiratory AcidosisElevated (>6.0kPa) Elevated (>+2)Respiratory Alkalosis >7.45 Low ( Low (Metabolic AcidosisLow ( Low (Metabolic Alkalosis >7.45 Elevated Elevated

basic medicine,1216,Which of the following is correct regarding hypothermia?,Can cause atrial fibrillation,Can cause Q waves on the electrocardiogram,Is commonly associated with alcohol withdrawal,Is defined as a core temperature less than 34°C,Is rarely seen in children as they have a higher basal metabolic rate,A,"Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature of less than 35°C. Children have a relatively large body surface area to weight ratio and even though they have a higher basal metabolic rate, they are very susceptible to hypothermia. Alcohol and anaesthetic gases cause vasodilatation, thus increase heat loss. As the core temperature continues to fall the cardiac rhythm becomes increasingly unstable; sinus bradycardia tends to give way to atrial fibrillation, followed by ventricular fibrillation and finally asystole. In hypothermic patients, J waves are frequently seen on the ECG. "
basic medicine,1217,The metabolic response to trauma causes a decrease in which of the following?,Anti-diuretic hormone,Glucagon secretion,Growth hormone,Insulin secretion,Urine osmolality,D,"The metabolic response to trauma is mediated by both endocrine and paracrine factors. In the neurohumoral response the pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system are important. Local released cytokines (for example, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukins) are important in modulating the response. Increased growth hormone and glucagon contribute to the hyperglycaemia seen following surgery and trauma. In the pancreas, glucagon is released and insulin secretion is diminished. Hypovolaemia results in increased antidiuretic hormone (ADH) production and an increase in urine osmolality."
basic medicine,1218,What is the mode of inheritance for hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia?,Mitochondrial,X linked recessive,X linked dominant,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,E,"Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia is autosomal dominant and causes abnormal blood vessel formation with arteriovenous malformation being particularly problematic. It is characterised by nose bleeds, telangiectasia and GI bleeding but can also cause cerebrovascular events, haemopytsis, and portal hypertension."
basic medicine,1219,Which of the following is true regarding a cervical rib?,Can cause compression of the axillary artery,Is always calcified,Is apparent on palpation in the supraclavicular region,Occurs in approximately 5% of the population,Originates from the seventh cervical vertebra,E,"In 0.5-1% of individuals, the costal elements of the seventh cervical vertebra form projections called cervical ribs. They are usually cartilaginous but may be partially/totally calcified. Commonly they have a head, neck, and tubercle, with varying amounts of body. They extend into the posterior triangle of the neck where they may be free anteriorly, or be attached to the first rib and/or sternum. Usually these ribs cause no symptoms, and are diagnosed after incidental finding on CXR. In some cases, the subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus are kinked where they pass over the cervical rib. Compression of these structures between this extra rib and the anterior scalene muscle may produce symptoms of nerve and arterial compression, producing the 'neurovascular compression syndrome'. Often the tingling, numbness, and impaired circulation to the upper limb do not appear until the age of puberty when the neck elongates and the shoulders tend to droop slightly."
basic medicine,1220,Use of which of the following drugs to treat hypertension is contraindicated in pregnancy?,Hydralazine,Labetalol,Methyldopa,Enalapril,Nifedipine,D,"Drugs useful in hypertension in pregnancy include:∙ Hydralazine∙ Methyldopa∙ Nifedipine, and∙ Labetalol.Drugs to be avoided in pregnancy include: ∙ Diuretics∙ ACE inhibitors ‐ AT and antagonists∙ Reserpine, and∙ Sodium nitroprusside."
basic medicine,1221,Which of the following is true of the micro-circulation?,Capillaries in the brain are fenestrated,Capillaries have sympathetic innervation,All capillaries have walls made up of a single layer of cells,The capillaries contain 5% of the total blood volume at any one time,The diameter of capillaries is 10-15 μm,D,"Arterioles are small precapillary resistance vessels (10-50 µm) composed of an endothelium surrounded by one or more layers of smooth muscle cells. These are innervated. Capillaries are small exchange vessels (4-8 µm) composed of highly attenuated endothelial cells surrounded by a basement membrane with no smooth muscle so are not innervated. The diameter of an erythocyte is 6-8 μm so red cells are deformed as they pass through capillaries. A discontinuous layer of pericytes may surround the endothelium. Fenestrations of 50-100 nm are present in the cytoplasm of the endothelium of capillaries in glomeruli, endocrine and exocrine glands. Capillaries in the the brain, lung and muscle do not have fenestrations. Fenestrated capillaries do not have pericytes. Capillaries contain 5-7% of blood volume."
basic medicine,1222,"A patient who has been stable on the same dose of morphine sulphate for many years becomes opiate toxic. He has been unwell and has not been eating or drinking. From the following, what is the most likely cause?",Asthma,Hyperthyroidism,Acute renal failure,Liver failure,Alcohol,C,The history suggests this patient may be dehydrated. Morphine is renally excreted thus acute renal failure can lead to toxicity.
basic medicine,1223,"Which molecule is produced in the nucleus, matures in the cytoplasm, binds to the ribosome, and initiates protein synthesis?",Messenger RNA,Ribosomal RNA,RNA nucleotide,RNA polymerase,Transfer RNA,A,"Protein synthesis consists of two phases. Transcription is where one strand of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) double helix is used as a template by ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase to synthesise messenger RNA from RNA nucleotides. The mRNA then migrates into the cytoplasm maturing, for example, by the splicing of non-coding sequences. Translation occurs when the ribosome binds to mRNA at the start codon and transfer RNA brings amino acids into position along the mRNA template. Ribosomal RNA interacts with transfer RNA during translation by providing peptidyl transferase activity. The ribosome moves from codon to codon along the mRNA producing a polypeptide sequence. Each type of RNA consists of nucleotides, which are made up of phosphate, ribose sugar, and nitrogen bases. RNA polymerase is the enzyme which is responsible for synthesing RNA molecules."
basic medicine,1224,The level of cellular telomerase activity will affect which of the following?,Cell death,Cell survival,RNA synthesis,The number of cell divisions a cell is capable of undergoing,The rate of cell growth,D,The telomere is a DNA sequence at the end of each chromosome which becomes progressively shorter with each division the cell undergoes. When it is reduced to a critical length the cell is not capable of dividing. The enzyme telomerase is able to lengthen the telomere thus preventing this occurring. Telomere length is being researched as to wheter it impacts mutations seen in many cancers and that shorter telomeres lead to a higher chance of multiple mutations occuring.
basic medicine,1225,Which of the following is true of the great (long) saphenous vein?,Ascends posterior to the medial malleolus,Passes through Colles' fascia,Passes through the femoral canal,Receives blood from the posterior tibial veins,Receives the superficial external pudendal veins,E,"The long saphenous vein can be divided into six anatomical regions:  Femoral triangle Anterior femoral region Patellar region Posteromedial lower leg Anteromedial lower leg, and Foot.  It has a linear course in the leg. It ascends vertically, posterior to the medial border of the tibia. It is accompanied by the superficial branch of the saphenous nerve. This anatomical relation obviously carries a risk of sensory disorders following stripping. At the knee, the long saphenous vein travels posteriorly to the medial femoral condyle (second constant anatomical landmark). It then travels superficially over the medial region of the thigh, remaining parallel to the medial edge of the sartorius muscle. In the femoral triangle, the long saphenous vein forms an arch as it penetrates into the depth of the thigh. It perforates the cribriform fascia immediately above Allan Burn's ligament, which actually corresponds to a reinforcement or fold of the cribriform fascia. The arch of the long saphenous vein then opens onto the anterior surface of the femoral vein 4 centimeters below the inguinal ligament. The femoral vein then passes through the femoral canal. The external pudendal veins drain part of the scrotum/labia. On branch drains from the superficial dorsal vein of the penis/clitoris.  The valves of the perforating veins should prevent backflow of blood from the deep to the superficial system."
basic medicine,1226,"A 68 year old female with hypertension is admitted with Pneumonia. She is found to have a Sodium of 121 although her urea, creatinine and potassium are normal. Her Heart rate is 95 and her BP is 130/60 and there is no evidence of peripheral oedema. How would you manage her hyponatraemia?",Furosemide,1.8% saline,IV fluids,Fluid restriction and suspend likely causative drugs,Demeclocycline,D,There is no clear time of onset of the hyponatraemia and this may well be a longstanding abnormality. The patient has a history of hypertension and may be on bendroflumethiazide or furosemide which can lower sodium. Omeprazole is another liky culprit as are ome anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine. Therefore the sodium should not be corrected rapidly due to risk of central pontine myelinosis. There is no evidence that this patient is dry and thus fluid restriction is appropriate especially as there may be an element of SIADH due to pneumonia. Democycline or 1.8% saline is utilised if this fails.
basic medicine,1227,"A patient is seen in clinic 6 weeks postpartum. The pregnancy was complicated by intrapartum haemorrhage requiring fluid resuscitation and a 2 unit blood transfusion. Mum reports feeling very tired, struggling to lose baby weight and needing to bottle feed due to very low volume lactation. What is the suspected diagnosis?",Diabetes Mellitus,Sheehan's Syndrome,Hyperpituitarism,Idiopathic hypothyroidism,Delayed transfusion reaction,B,"This patient has signs of hypopituatarism. In hypopituitarism one or more of the pituitary hormone levels is reduced. The hormones are ACTH, TSH, LH, FSH, Prolactin, Growth hormone (GH), Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), ADH, Oxytocin.Sheehan's syndrome is hypopituitarism caused by ischaemic necrosis due to blood loss and hypovolemic shock during and after childbirth. Typical signs of absence or difficulty with lactation, amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea and features of hypothyroidism (tiredness, weight gain etc) due to reduced TSH."
basic medicine,1228,"A 17-year-old male presents to the Emergency Department after an overdose of alcohol and paracetamol. He complained of abdominal discomfort and an intravenous infusion of N-Acetylcysteine was commenced. Fifteen minutes later he developed breathlessness, reported feeling flushed and developed a tachycardia. What is the cause of this reaction?",A disulfiram-like (antabuse) reaction has occurred,The patient has developed pulmonary oedema,The patient has had a panic attack,The patient has received an overdose of N-Acetylcysteine,The patient has received N-Acetylcysteine previously,E,"This patient is having an acute hypersensitivity reaction the most common, dose independent adverse drug reaction. It is caused by previous exposure and being sensitised to the drug. The initial exposure induces the production of antibodies of Ig E class, subsequent exposure induces an immunological reaction - anaphylaxis. Some drugs can produce an similar pseudoallergic reaction on first exposure. The majority of dose-related adverse reactions occur within the first hour of the initial infusion of acetylcysteine. The MHRA now recommends extending the time of the initial infusion from 15 minutes to 60 minutes in order to reduce the incidence of adverse reactions. Even if a patient has a history of a previous reaction to intravenous acetylcisteine, the benefits outweigh the risks and patient should receive treatment. Any 'hypersensitivity-like' reactions are more likely to be anaphylactoid in nature (i.e. not immunologically mediated) and therefore may not occur on repeated exposure. "
basic medicine,1229,Which of the following is correct regarding erythropoietin?,Decreases red cell destruction,Decreases red cell production,Is produced by the kidneys,Is produced by the lungs,Is secreted in response to a high kidney tissue pCO2,C,Erythropoietin is produced predominantly by the kidneys and is not secreted by the lungs. It acts by stimulating the stem cells in the bone marrow. Secretion of erythropoietin is inversely related to kidney tissue PO2. Anaemia is frequently a feature of chronic renal failure and is now frequently treated with recombinant erythropoietin (EPO).

basic medicine,1231,Which of the following is true regarding neuroendocrine tumours?,Diarrhoea is an uncommon feature in the gastrinoma syndrome,Elevated calcitonin is a feature of the MEN type 1,High plasma chromogranin A concentrations are feature of carcinoid syndrome,Mitral stenosis is a feature of carcinoid syndrome,Thromboembolic events are uncommon in the glucagonoma syndrome,C,"Calcitonin is elevated in association with medullary thyroid cancer found in MEN type 2. Chromogranin A and B are elevated in association with carcinoid, as are urine 5-HIAA concentrations. Right-sided cardiac valvular lesions are found in association with carcinoid due to the secretion of histamine/bradykinin/5-HT which is metabolised by the lung, thus preventing left-sided cardiac lesions. Migratory thromboses and necrolytic migratory erythema are features of glucagonoma."
basic medicine,1232,"A 23-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with low grade fever and dysuria. Her only medication is the oral contraceptive pill. On examination her temperature is 37.8°C, and she has suprapubic and left loin tenderness consistent with a urine infection and possible pyelonephritis. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 12.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 209 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 82 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following antibiotics do SIGN guidelines recommend for this patient?",Amoxicillin,Ciprofloxacin,Co-trimoxazole,Nitrofurantoin,Trimethoprim,B,"Upper urinary tract infection is one area where resistance to antimicrobials is increasing. For this reason trimethoprim and amoxicillin are not recommended for treatment of upper urinary tract infections, and even resistance to quinolones such as ciprofloxacin is now beginning to prove problematic. Nitrofurantoin is not used for the treatment of upper urinary tract infections because of difficulty in achieving sufficient plasma concentration, and co-trimoxazole is a second line choice due to problems with blood dyscrasias. HPA suggests patients started on ciprofloxacin should have urine sent for culture and patients admitted to hospital if there is no response to treatment in 24 hours. "

basic medicine,1234,"A 30-year-old male is admitted to the assessment unit with a 72 hour history of significant lethargy, fever and a sore throat. The nurse is concerned that his breathing is 'noisy' and describes it to you over the phone as harsh and high pitched. His current observations demonstrate a temperature of 39.4°C and a raised respiratory and heart rate. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Anaphylaxis,Bacterial tracheitis,Croup,Foreign body aspiration,Laryngospasm,B,"Added airway sounds must always be addressed with the utmost urgency. Stridor in particular is heard predominantly on inspiration and implies a compromised upper airway. It is important to remember that stridor is a sign and not a diagnosis, and the underlying cause must be sought urgently. All the causes listed above can present with stridor, thus the history is paramount in helping to identify the correct precipitant. In children croup (viral laryngotracheitis) is the most common reason for a patient to present with stridor, with parainfluenza 1 virus being the most common precipitant. The barking cough of croup and subsequent stridor is predominantly limited to children under the age of 12, and thus stridor in adults should demand the clinician to pursue other more likely diagnoses. In this case the patient appears toxic with worsening lethargy, pyrexia and overt deterioration of the upper airway. A bacterial cause must be suspected and bacterial tracheitis is the most likely culprit. Diphtheria can present with stridor, however immunisation programmes have reduced the incidence in the western world. Remember to consider varying levels of immunisation in patients who have grown up abroad. Laryngospasm is a common cause of stridor in adults but again a relevant precipitant must be sought out. Exposure to smoke and toxic fumes in a history should lend a high degree of suspicion, and prompt the clinician urgently to involve the anaesthetic teams in consideration of securing the patient's airway. The diagnoses of foreign body and anaphylaxis are both life threatening and must always be considered and excluded, however the duration and onset of the stridor will be a key factor. An abrupt onset with a history of eating nuts or even chewing on a pen lid or plastic bead is often present in foreign body aspiration and thus must be sought out. Anaphylaxis again may have a defined food precipitant and the onset is often more rapid than in the other conditions."
basic medicine,1235,A 70-year-old male presents with haemoptysis. Bronchoscopy reveals a tumour in the proximal right main bronchus. Which of the following is a contraindication to radical radiotherapy?,Adenocarcinoma,FEV1 of 25% predicted,Involvement of the pulmonary artery,Ischaemic heart disease,Superior vena caval obstruction,B,"Patients with potentially operable tumours who are either too unfit for surgery, or who refuse surgery may be suitable for radical radiotherapy; that is, radiotherapy with intention to cure using doses of at least 60 Gy.

basic medicine,1238,The nurse bleeped you because an obese patient is feeling nauseated and is vomiting. He is also complaining of seeing green and yellow halos. He has recently been treated with a standard intravenous bolus of digoxin for fast atrial fibrillation. His creatinine clearance is normal. Digoxin toxicity is suspected. What do you think is the cause of his symptoms?,Decreased hepatic excretion,Decreased protein binding,Decreased renal clearance,Decreased volume of distribution,Increased half life,D,"Digoxin is concentrated in tissues and therefore has a large apparent volume of distribution. Serum digoxin concentrations are not significantly altered by large changes in fat tissue weight so that its distribution space correlates best with lean (that is, ideal) body weight, not total body weight. In this case a higher dose than necessary was given due to calculation on the patient total body weight, resulting in digoxin toxicity. In other words his distribution space had been overestimated. Ideal body weight should be used, rather than total body weight, when calculating doses. Approximately 25% of digoxin in the plasma is bound to protein."

basic medicine,1240,In which of the following cases is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) raised?,Following the infusion of high molecular weight dextran,In childhood,In men compared with women,In polycythaemia rubra vera,When plasma fibrinogen concentrations increase,E,"ESR is elevated in inflammatory disease processes such as:  Rheumatoid arthritis Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) (associated with other raised inflammatory markers - fibrinogen) Malignancy (myeloma).  It increases with age (roughly, normal ESR is age divided by two) and tends to be higher in females. In polycythaemia, the ESR is low. Fibrinogen increase ESR, when an inflammatory process is present, the high proportion of fibrinogen in the blood causes red blood cells to stick to each other. The red cells form stacks called rouleaux which settle faster, due to their increased density."
basic medicine,1241,Which of the following is a characteristic feature of familial hypercholesterolaemia?,Autosomal dominant inheritance,Elevated chylomicrons,Hypertriglyceridaemia,Increased expression of LDL receptors,Palmar xanthomas,A,Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant condition which manifests by increased low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations (not chylomicrons) due to constitutional abnormalities and reduced numbers of the LDL receptor. Hypertriglyceridaemia is not characteristic and high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentrations are usually decreased. Tendon xanthomata are characteristic and the condition is associated with a premature cardiovascular mortality. Palmar xanthomas are more commonly associated with type III hyperlipidaemia.

The mechanism through which this happens remains unclear. In order to safeguard against harm a UK Clozaril Patient Monitoring System ensures strict monitoring of all patients on this treatment. A white cell count with differential is checked prior to treatment, then weekly for the first 18 weeks, then two weekly from week 18 to 52, and then four weekly after one year of clozapine with stable blood results. They are then checked for four weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Olanzapine has been associated with agranulocytosis in the form of case reports in the literature. However, unlike clozapine, this link is not well established. None of the other medications listed are commonly associated with agranulocytosis."
basic medicine,1246,Which of the following is true regarding maximum urinary concentration?,Involves the action of water-permeable channels within cells,Is dependent mainly on the proximal tubular cells,Is impaired in hyperkalaemia,Is impaired in hypocalcaemia,Is increased in severe malnutrition,A,Maximum urinary concentration involves the action of water-permeable channels within cells. It is the final step in the action of vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone). Vasopressin binds to specific renal tubular receptors which activate cAMP. This leads to activation of intracellular protein kinases to organise microtubules and microfilaments that open water channels across the luminal cell membrane. Maximum urinary concentration is dependent mainly on the collecting ducts. It is impaired in hypercalcaemia (polyuria and polydypsia). Hypercalcaemia may cause nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The maximum concentrating and diluting ability of the kidney is impaired in severe malnutrition.

basic medicine,1260,Which is true of a cervical rib?,It commonly causes compression of the subclavian artery and brachial plexus,It is apparent on palpation in the supraclavicular region,It occurs commonly,It originates from the 7th cervical vertebra,All of the above,D,"In 0.5-1% of individuals, the costal elements of the seventh cervical vertebra form projections called cervical ribs. Commonly they have a head, neck, and tubercle, with varying amounts of body. They extend into the posterior triangle of the neck where they may be free anteriorly, or be attached to the first rib and/or sternum. Usually these ribs cause no symptoms, and are diagnosed after incidental finding on CXR. In some cases, the subclavian artery and the lower trunk of the brachial plexus are kinked where they pass over the cervical rib. Compression of these structures between this extra rib and the anterior scalene muscle may produce symptoms of nerve and arterial compression, producing the andquot;neurovascular compression syndromeandquot;. Often the tingling, numbness, and impaired circulation to the upper limb do not appear until the age of puberty when the neck elongates and the shoulders tend to droop slightly."

basic medicine,1265,A 68-year-old lady with mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation is taking warfarin. Lately her INR has fallen and the dose of warfarin has had to be increased. Which of the following new treatments may account for this change?,Allopurinol,Amiodarone,Clarithromycin,Sertraline,St John's wort,E,"Drugs that are metabolised in the liver can induce hepatic microsomal enzymes. Induction of enzymes by one drug can gradually increase the rate of metabolism of another, resulting in lower plasma concentrations and a reduced effect. St John's wort is an enzyme inducer and therefore can increase the metabolism of warfarin and make it less effective. All the other options enhance the effect of warfarin. Allopurinol can interact with warfarin to enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Amiodarone inhibits metabolism of coumarins (enhanced anticoagulant effect). Clarithromycin enhances anticoagulant effect of coumarins This is because warfarin is metabolised by the same CYP3A isozyme as clarithromycin. Clarithromycin, known to inhibit CYP3A, and a drug primarily metabolised by CYP3A may be associated with elevations in drug concentrations that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and adverse effects of the concomitant drug. Sertraline may interact with warfarin to enhance the anticoagulant effect. "

basic medicine,1271,Which of the following hereditary cancer syndromes is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer?,Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer,Multiple endocrine neoplasia,Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,von Hippel-Lindau syndrome,Xeroderma pigmentosa,A,"All of the above hereditary cancer syndromes cause a patient to be at an increased risk of developing various cancers, but HNPCC is the condition which most increases the risk of ovarian cancer. This is due to inherited mutations with DNA mismatch repair, which most commonly results in colorectal carcinomas. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of ovarian carcinoma, but to a lesser extent than HNPCC. More classically associated with Peutz-Jeghers are stomach, small intestine and pancreatic-biliary tumours.

She takes a range of medication including omeprazole for severe reflux oesophagitis. A T score was measured at -4.2, and she was unable to tolerate weekly alendronate due to symptoms of indigestion. Which of the following is the most appropriate alternative for her?",Daily calcium and vitamin D,Daily strontium ranelate,Monthly ibandronate,Monthly risedronate,Six monthly denosumab,E,"Six monthly denosumab is correct because it is effective in managing osteoporosis in this patient type. This patient falls into the severe osteoporosis range and definitely requires therapy in excess of calcium and vitamin D. Whilst bisphosphonates can be given monthly, they still cause oesophagitis and are not appropriate here. Denosumab is a rank ligand inhibitor leading to inhibition of osteoclast activity. It is given by six monthly subcutaneous injection and is associated with a 40% reduction in the risk of hip fracture over three years. It is recommended in NICE guidance on Osteoporotic fractures - denosumab (TA204) for this patient type. Daily calcium and vitamin D are incorrect because they are less effective than bisphosphonates in the treatment of osteoporosis. Strontium ranelate is incorrect because it is associated with increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Monthly ibandronate is incorrect because it is still associated with symptoms of oesophagitis. Monthly risedronate is incorrect because it is still associated symptoms of oesophagitis."

Which of the following is most likely to be responsible for this result?,Alcohol excess,Anaemia of chronic disease,Hyperthyroidism,Menorrhagia due to uterine fibroids,Peptic ulceration,A,"Causes of a high MCV include folate or B12 deficiency (pernicious anaemia), alcoholism and hypothyroidism. Blood loss, as in peptic ulceration or menorrhagia, is associated with iron deficiency and microcytosis. "
basic medicine,1276,"A 40-year-old male, with disseminated malignancy and unknown primary, presents with oedema of the arms and face, with dilated neck veins. You suspect superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO). Which of the following statements is correct?",IV dexamethasone is of no benefit,Loss of pulsation in the venous system of the neck is of no clinical use in the diagnosis of SVCO,Mediastinal radiotherapy relieves symptoms in 80% of patients,Palliative treatment alone is indicated,Small cell lung cancer is unlikely to be the cause,C,"This is an oncological emergency. Mediastinal radiotherapy leads to symptomatic relief in 80% of patients, although case studies have shown this does not always correlate to patency of the superior vena cava.  If possible, an attempt should be made to obtain a tissue diagnosis, as some tumours respond to radiotherapy whereas others are more sensitive to chemotherapy. Tumours which are very chemosensitive, such as germ cell and lymphoma, can cause superior vena cava obstruction.  Therefore the active pursuit of a diagnosis with active treatment of the SVCO is indicated and not merely palliative measures, especially in a patient this young. Non-small cell cancer and small cell malignancy may both cause SVCO. Intravenous dexamethasone at high dose is of benefit in severe cases of SVCO. It is important to note that in 2004 NICE recommended considering stenting in the majority of cases of SVCO. This is a minimally invasive procedure which relieves symptoms quicker than chemotherapy or radiotherapy."

basic medicine,1278,Which one of the above statements regarding iron metabolism is correct?,Iron is transported in plasma by ferritin,The average daily iron loss in women of reproductive age is 2mg,"In healthy females, ~ 50-60% of ingested iron is absorbed from the gut",Daily iron intake is ~ 1-2g,The majority of iron in the body is contained in ferritin,B,"IRON METABOLISM∙ Body contains ~4.5g iron - 65% in Hb, 5% in myoglobin. Small amount in cytochrome-dependentenzymes∙ Transported in plasma as transferring and stored in tissues (liver mainly) as ferritin. Haemosiderin is avery insoluble iron store only formed in iron overload∙ Average daily iron loss is 1mg (males) and 2mg (females of reproductive age)∙ Children and pregnant women require more iron∙ Daily iron intake 15-20mg of which 0.5-2mg is absorbed (~10% of intake)Absorption∙ Iron absorption inhibited by phytates, phosphate, bicarbonate and tannins which form insolublecomplexes∙ Iron absorption promoted by vitamin C and HCl. HCl solubilises iron while ascorbate reduces iron (3+) toiron (2+) which is less likely to form insoluble complexes∙ Heme iron better absorbed than non-heme iron∙ Ferrous iron (2+) better absorbed than ferric iron (3+)∙ Following absorption, ferrous iron (2+) is converted to ferric iron (3+) and bound to ferritin within intestinalepithelial cells or transported into the plasma where it is bound to transferring - a beta-globulinsynthesised by the liver - transferin saturation ~33%∙ Each transferring molecule binds two atoms of ferric iron∙ Transferrin-bound iron becomes attached to specific receptors on erythroblasts and reticulocytes and theiron is removed∙ Iron stored as ferritin in gut epithelial cells is lost as the cells are shed∙ Haemosiderin is an insoluble iron-protein complex in macrophages, hepatocytes and spleen∙ Mostly absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum by carrier mediated transport∙ Iron deficiency results in increased GI uptake - mechanism effective within 3-4 days∙ Serum iron concentration 11-30 microM - levels higher in the morning∙ The body cannot get rid of excess iron and absorption has to be matched to requirements. Excessive ironmay be removed by chealating agents such as desferrioxamine"

basic medicine,1283,Which structure emerges from the pelvis through the greater sciatic foramen above the piriformis muscle?,Inferior gluteal nerve,Posterior femoral cutaneous nerve,Pudendal nerve,Sciatic nerve,Superior gluteal nerve,E,"The inferior gluteal nerve (L5, S1, S2) passes beneath the lower border of piriformis and sinks into the deep surface of gluteus maximus. The pudendal nerve (S2, S3, S4) emerges beneath piriformis then passes around the sacrospinous ligament and then passes forward through the lesser sciatic foramen. The superior gluteal nerve (L4, L5, S1) emerges from the greater sciatic foramen above piriformis and immediately disappears beneath the posterior border of gluteus medius. The sciatic nerve (L4, L5, S1, S2, S3) passes below piriformis more laterally than the inferior gluteal and pudendal nerves and vessels. The posterior femoral cutaneous nerve (S2, S3) lies on the sciatic nerve as it passes beneath piriformis."
basic medicine,1284,A patient is taking bendroflumethiazide for hypertension. Which of the following is likely to increase whilst on bendroflumethiazide therapy?,Magnesium,Potassium,Sodium,Uric acid,White cell count,D,"Hydrochlorothiazide and other thiazide diuretics may cause metabolic disturbances especially at high doses. They may provoke hyperglycaemia and glycosuria in diabetic and other susceptible patients. They may cause hyperuricaemia and precipitate attacks of gout in some patients. Thiazide diuretics may be associated with electrolyte imbalances including hypochloraemic alkalosis, hyponatraemia, and hypokalaemia. Hypokalaemia intensifies the effect of digitalis on cardiac muscle and treatment with digitalis or its glycosides may have to be temporarily suspended. Patients with cirrhosis of the liver are particularly at risk from hypokalaemia. Hyponatraemia may occur in patients with severe heart failure who are very oedematous, particularly with large doses used with restricted salt in the diet. The urinary excretion of calcium is reduced. Hypomagnesaemia has also occurred. Adverse changes in plasma lipids have also been noted but their clinical significance is unclear."
basic medicine,1285,A 41-year-old male presents with an acute onset of epigastric pain. His serum amylase on admission is 1874 U/l (60-180) and he is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Which of the following parameters form part of the modified Glasgow criteria for stratifying acute pancreatitis?,Alkaline phosphatase,C reactive protein,Creatinine,Glucose,PaCO2,D,"Acute pancreatitis is associated with alcohol or gallstones in more than 80% of patients, although the ratio of these two causes has a wide geographical variation. Gallstone disease predominates in the UK. Acute pancreatitis is usually self-limiting, however 15-20% of patients develop severe acute pancreatitis (pancreatic necrosis and associated cytokine activation), which results in multiple organ dysfunction syndrome if not aggressively treated. Early identification of patients with a severe attack allows prompt treatment. The modified Glasgow criteria are used to predict patients with severe acute pancreatitis and include:  Age greater than55 years Albumin less than32 g/L Arterial oxygen partial pressure less than8.0 kPa Blood glucose greater than10 mmol/L Calcium less than2.0 mmol/L Lactate dehydrogenase greater than600 U/L Urea greater than16 mmol/L White cell count greater than15 ×10^9/L.

basic medicine,1287,"A 45-year-old Indian man is seen by his GP with oropharyngeal candidiasis and treated with fluconazole. One month later he developed a dry cough, night sweats and shortness of breath (SOB) on exertion. On admission to hospital, CT of his thorax revealed bilateral ground glass shadowing. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Late onset asthma,Pneumococcal pneumonia,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP),Tuberculosis (TB),Viral pneumonitis (H1N1),C,"HIV diagnoses are often delayed in groups of patients other than sub-Saharan Africans and men who have sex with men. Guidance in 2008 aimed to reduce barriers to HIV testing but there is still reluctance to offer HIV testing to patients, despite unusual clinical presentations, outside traditional risk groups. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a eukaryotic microorganism. In immunosuppressed patients, it can cause pneumonia, which is most recognised in patients with AIDS but can also be seen in those with organ transplants or when undergoing chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 is associated with significant risk. In Europe, the USA and Australia P. jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients is seen largely in those unaware of their HIV status. Unfortunately, it is a major cause of death in Africa, especially in children. Previously it was thought that disease was caused by reactivation of latent infection acquired in childhood, but de novo infection is increasingly recognised. Pneumonia caused by P. jiroveci is potentially severe and fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Clinically it presents with several weeks' history of dry cough, fever and dyspnoea. Examination findings are often subtle but include tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and fine respiratory crackles. Typically, patients desaturate markedly on exertion. There may be reduced transfer factor, vital capacity and total lung capacity on spirometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum can be used to demonstrate the organism (open lung biopsy is gold standard, but rarely performed in clinical practice). Giemsa, Papanicolaou and Grocott's stains are used. There are a variety of different chest radiograph findings. Typically it causes bilateral symmetrical perihilar reticular or granular interstitial shadowing. Less often there can be asymmetric shadowing or progression to a reticular-alveolar pattern. Occasionally lobar consolidation, nodular lesions, prominent pulmonary arteries, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, cysts or pneumatoceles can be seen. In patients who have been on prophylactic inhaled pentamidine, the infiltrates may predominantly affect the upper lobes. A normal chest x ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not typical, but be aware of the possibility of multiple disease processes in an immunosuppressed patient. If allowed to progress, P.jiroveci can disseminate via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes to affect the thyroid, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen.  If PCP is suspected, treatment with full dose co-trimoxazole should be started as soon as possible. It should be given for 21 days in HIV-positive cases, but shorter doses can be used in other causes of immunosuppression. In patients who are intolerant or co-trimoxazole, intravenous pentamidine can be used. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids can reduce the risk of respiratory failure, and they are therefore used in some cases. Prophylaxis should be used in immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of developing PCP: all those with a CD4 count of less than200, patients started on high dose steroids and those on chemotherapeutic regimens associated with significant immunosuppression. Co-trimoxazole is also the first line prophylactic agent. All the other diagnoses are less likely given the radiographic findings, in the setting of probable undiagnosed advanced HIV infection."

basic medicine,1289,Regarding unilateral undescended testes:,Are less commonly associated with an indirect inguinal hernia than bilateral undescended testes,If untreated they cause a delay in the onset of puberty,Occur more often in full term babies,Rarely descend spontaneously after one year,Should ideally be operated on between 7 and 10 years,D,"Undescended testis, both unilateral and bilateral, are more common in preterm and low birth weight infants. They rarely descend after the age of one year, and therefore require orchidopexy in the second year of life. Unilateral and bilateral cases are associated with indirect inguinal hernias. If untreated, complications such as infertility and risk of malignancy are increased, but there is no association with delayed puberty. Around 10% of men with testicular tumours have a history of maldescended testis/testes. The overall risk is estimated at greater than4 times normal. Orchidopexy does not appear to reduce the risk which also apples to a normally descended testis on the contralateral side."
basic medicine,1290,A 56-year-old male with diabetes presents with a two day history of weakness of the left foot being aware of a feeling of dragging the toes along the floor when walking. He has been diabetic for two years and on previous annual review no abnormalities were noted. On examination he is unable to dorsiflex his left foot together with eversion of the foot. The right foot is unaffected. Plantar flexion and inversion are normal. Which sensory abnormality would you expect to find in association with this motor defect?,No associated sensory loss,Sensory loss over the big toe,Sensory loss over the entire foot to the ankle.,Sensory loss over the lateral part of the leg and dorsum of the foot,Sensory loss over the plantar aspect of the foot,D,"This male with diabetes appears to have developed a mononeuropathy with the features compatible with a common peroneal nerve neuropathy. This would result in a loss of sensation over the dorsum of the foot and lateral part of the leg with sparing of the fifth toe. Although you could argue that a peripheral neuropathy might be expected in this diabetic, the question specifically asks what defect would you expect to find with this neuropathy. Also previously normal findings would argue against a sudden peripheral neuropathy. "

basic medicine,1296,"Post surgery for a thyroid tumour, a woman develops a hoarse voice. Her surgeon explains to her that the reason for this is a vocal cord paralysis caused by accidental damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerve. This has most likely been damaged during ligation of which blood vessel running next to it?",Inferior thyroid artery,Inferior thyroid vein,Superior thyroid artery,Superior thyroid vein,Thyroid ima artery,A,The recurrent laryngeal nerve is related to the inferior thyroid artery. The recurrent laryngeal nerve runs in the groove between the trachea and the oesophagus. It enters the larynx deep to the inferior constrictor muscle. The inferior thyroid artery is a branch of the thyrocervical trunk. The external laryngeal nerve runs near the superior thyroid artery but is less commonly damaged. Damage to this nerve will generally only lead to a slight hoarseness. The superior thyroid artery is a branch of the external carotid artery.

basic medicine,1299,"A 17-year-old male was found by the police in an acutely confused state in the early hours of the morning. He was taken to the local Emergency department where he is a frequent attender with a history of schizophrenia and deliberate self-harm. He is found to have dilated pupils and was somewhat agitated with visual hallucinations and a sinus tachycardia of 110 beats per minute on electrocardiogram. He later told the nursing staff that he had taken some acid of unknown quantity because the voice had told him to, so that he can be protected against other people poisoning him. He was observed overnight in hospital where he became less agitated and his heart rate had returned to normal. Prior to discharge, he was reviewed by the on-call psychiatric team and his antipsychotic medication was changed to olanzapine. A week later, his mother found him semiconscious in his flat. His admission electrocardiogram showed a sinus tachycardia of 115 beats per minute, his pupils were dilated and he had a temperature of 39°C.

It is rarer with the newer anti-psychotic drugs such as olanzapine, but can occur. It results in an elevated temperature set-point, impairment of normal thermal homeostasis, extrapyramidally-induced muscular rigidity and rhabdomyolysis, altered mental status and autonomic dysfunction. Diagnosis can be made if neuroleptics have been taken within 1-4 weeks, temperature above 38°C, muscle rigidity and five of the following features:  Altered mental status Tachycardia Hypotension or hypertension Tremor hyporeflexia but lead pipe rigidity Incontinence Diaphoresis or sialorrhoea Increased creatine phosphokinase or urinary myoglobiin Metabolic acidosis Leucocytosis, and Exclusion of other illnesses .  This patient does have rhabdomyolysis, but the overriding cause is neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Rhabdomyolysis is isolation is most commonly seen following trauma or following prolonged immobilisation. NMS presents with hyporeflexia and lead pipe rigidity whereas Serotonin syndrome will present with hyperreflexia. Urinary tract infection would not explain all the signs seen above. Many of the features of serotonin syndrome are the same as those of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, but the medications this patient is on make the latter more likely. Amphetamine overdose could lead to the symptoms described above, but the stem given should lead you more towards the use of neuroleptics rather than amphetamines."

basic medicine,1303,A 72‐year‐woman has undergone a major small and large bowel resection for acute mesenteric ischaemia. As a result she requires lifelong total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Which of the following metabolic side effects of TPN is she unlikely to develop?,Hypoglycaemia,Fatty acid deficiency,Hyperglycaemia,Hypercarbia,Metabolic alkalosis,E,"The side effects of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) are numerous and include catheter‐related sepsis and metabolic abnormalities resulting from the administered nutrients.Fatty acid deficiency may develop during prolonged TPN, though administering 3% of the total caloric input as linoleic acid prevents or corrects this deficiency. Hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis may occur because of the liberation of hydrochloric acid during the metabolism of amino acids in the TPN.Hypercarbia occurs from the increased production of carbon dioxide resulting from the metabolism of large amounts of glucose. A requirement for ventilatory support or weaning difficulties may subsequently occur.Hyperglycaemia is a potential problem until endogenous insulin production increases, requiring frequent glucose monitoring.Hypovolaemia due to an osmotic diuresis and a non‐ketotic hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma are both potential complications of TPN, which may necessitate the addition of insulin to the TPN solutions.Accidental or sudden discontinuation of the TPN infusion may cause hypoglycaemia. The pancreatic insulin response may persist despite discontinuing the TPN, resulting in a high plasma insulin concentration.Consequently intravenous glucose administration may be required, or alternatively a gradual discontinuation of the TPN over 60 to 90 minutes."

What is the most appropriate next step in the drug's development?",Case-control study,No further studies should be done and drug development should be stopped,Open study,Randomised double blind placebo controlled study,Randomised single blind placebo controlled study,D,"The story that is described is of an early drug development that has gone through phase I trials (normal volunteers) and phase II studies (more normal volunteers but it also mentions 'studies in patients'). The next step in the development of this drug is a phase III study - where the drug's efficacy and safety should be tested against a placebo. Broadly, the development of a new drug can be divided into pre-clinical and clinical trials. Pre-clinical development first involves identifying the target thought to be important in disease. Drug candidates are then identified, and their properties optimised. Pre-clinical safety studies are then conducted to determine dosage, ensure safety and study pharmacokinetic properties. These involve both computer and animal models. All information gathered from pre-clinical testing is submitted to the regulatory authorities, prior to moving to the clinical phase of drug development. Clinical trials have a number of phases:  In phase I the drug is usually given to healthy volunteers to determine its safety and pharmacokinetic properties in humans. In phase II a small group of patients (typically 100-250) are given the drug to evaluate its efficacy, optimum dose, safety and side effects (as these may be different in patients compared to healthy volunteers). If these trials are successful larger clinical trials can be planned. Phase III trials typically involve more than 1000 patients, and are used to determine efficacy and side effects. If successful the drug must be registered by the authorities prior to being released to the market.  It is important to note the majority of drugs identified in early pre-clinical trials will never make it to market, as they are not shown to have a significant effect or they are associated with significant toxicity. Post-marketing studies then continue to determine the long term and chronic toxicities. UK practitioners are requested to report any side effects via the yellow card scheme."
basic medicine,1307,Which of the following substances is correctly paired with the disease that ensues as a result of deficiency?,Ascorbic acid ‐ night blindness,Niacin ‐ beriberi,Folates ‐ sprue,Cyanocobalamin ‐ microcytic anaemia,Thiamine ‐ pellagra,C,"The correct associations are:∙ Thiamine ‐ beriberi∙ Cyanocobalamin (B12) ‐ pernicious anaemia∙ Niacin (B3) ‐ pellagra∙ Folates ‐ macrocytic anaemia∙ Ascorbic acid ‐ scurvy∙ Folate deficiency ‐ tropical sprue.Tropical sprue is characterised by malabsorption, inflammation, and flattening of the villi and lining of the small intestines. This results in:∙ chronic diarrhoea∙ steatorrhoea (foul‐smelling, greasy)∙ weight loss, and∙ abdominal cramps.Ultimately it will result in malnutrition through multiple vitamin deficiencies including folate, and deficiency of minerals including calcium. The diagnosis is confirmed on intestinal biopsy. The cause is unknown, although possible causes include bacterial, viral, parasite, and amoeba infection.Coeliac disease (non‐tropical sprue) or gluten intolerance can be confused with tropical sprue as the symptoms are similar. It also leads to malnutrition and multiple vitamin deficiencies including folate deficiency. However the pathophysiology is different. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease triggered by gluten in the diet, resulting in flattening and inflammation of the intestinal villi and mucosa. The diagnosis is confirmed by:∙ endoscopy and intestinal biopsy∙ blood tests showing antibodies to gluten.Both tropical sprue and coeliac disease can cause folate deficiency, due to chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption."

basic medicine,1309,Which of the following is correct regarding gastrin?,Is predominantly produced by G cells located in the pancreas,Levels are decreased in atrophic gastritis (pernicious anaemia),Stimulates gastric acid secretion in response to gastric emptying,"Stimulates insulin secretion, particularly after a carbohydrate meal",Stimulates the growth of cells in the gastric mucosa,E,"Gastrin has a variety of actions, but its principal physiological actions are:  Stimulation of gastric acid (in response to food entering the stomach) Pepsin secretion, and Stimulation of the growth of the mucosa of the stomach and intestine.  Gastrin is normally mainly produced in the G cells in the gastric antrum, and is also produced in the duodenum. Gastrin is produced in the pancreas in the fetus, and in adults with pancreatic gastrin secreting tumours (gastrinomas). Levels are increased in conditions of low acid production, for example, atrophic gastritis and proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy due to loss of negative feedback. The only time gastrin levels are high enough to stimulate insulin secretion is following a protein meal."

basic medicine,1338,A 73-year-old male smoker presents with haemoptysis of three weeks duration. Examination reveals left supraclavicular lymphadenopthy. A chest radiograph reveals a left sided hilar mass. Which of the following would be an appropriate next step in the investigation of this patient?,Bronchoscopy,CT thorax and upper abdomen,Lymph node biopsy,PET scanning,Sputum cytology,B,"This patient is likely to have lung carcinoma, which is the case for 39,000 people each year in the UK. Unfortunately only 5.5% of these are currently cured, and emphasis is currently on recognising the disease in its early stages to allow for treatment when it can still be controlled. NICE guidelines recommend urgent chest radiograph in patients with haemoptysis or unexplained, persistent (greater than3 weeks) cough, chest or shoulder pain, dyspnoea, weight loss, chest signs, hoarseness, finger clubbing, cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. If this suggests lung carcinoma, as in this case, patients should be referred urgently to the lung cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT). Patients should then be offered a contrast-enhanced CT chest (including the liver and adrenals). This should be performed before bronchoscopy or any other biopsy procedure. If the CT demonstrates a peripheral lung lesion, CT or ultrasound-guided transthoracic needle biopsy should be offered. Endobronchial ultrasound guided biopsy is recommended for paratracheal and peri-bronchial intra-parenchymal lung lesions. Enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes (greater than10 mm maximum short axis on CT) or other lesions should be biopsied in preference to the primary lesion if determination of stage affects treatment. Other techniques (such as ultrasound) should be considered if there is suspicion of mediastinal of chest wall invasion in patients otherwise thought to be surgical candidates. Patients potentially suitable for treatment with curative intent should be offered PET-CT prior to this. MRI is not routinely used, but can give helpful information in superior sulcus tumours. Sputum cytology is rarely indicated and should be reserved for the investigation of patients who have centrally placed masses and are unable to tolerate, or unwilling to undergo, bronchoscopy or other invasive tests. An x ray should be performed in the first instance for patients with localised signs suggestive of bone metastases. If the results are negative or inconclusive, a bone scan or MRI should be offered. Bone scintigraphy should be avoided if PET-CT has not shown bone metastases. "

Nebulisers are repeated 'back-to-back' but she remains tachypnoeic with wheeze but good air entry. What is the next step in your management?",IV Augmentin,IV Magnesium,IV Potassium,Non-invasive ventilation,Oral prednisolone,B,"This question focuses on acute treatment of asthma. Your initial approach should be SOS:  Salbutamol Oxygen, and Steroids (IV).  In the meantime a CXR should be organised to rule out pneumothorax. You should then consider further efforts to treat bronchoconstriction - a silent chest, or a tiring patient should suggest ITU review. The recommended dose of magnesium is 2 g over 30 minutes. The mechanism by which it has its effect is not fully understood, but it is thought that low magnesium levels in bronchial smooth muscle favour bronchoconstriction. IV theophylline may be considered, but magnesium would be higher on the list. IV antibiotic may be indicated, but your initial focus should be promoting bronchodilation. IV potassium may be required as the beta agonists push down the potassium. Oral prednisolone can wait, as you have already given IV hydrocortisone as part of your SOS approach. Non-invasive ventilation has no role in the acute management of asthma."

basic medicine,1353,"A 49-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with right sided pleuritic chest pain. She has had two previous pulmonary emboli (PE) and is on lifelong warfarin therapy. On examination she is short of breath and in pain. Her BP is 105/70 mmHg and her pulse is 92. Auscultation of the chest is normal. She has a swollen left leg, but she tells you this is chronic since an extensive DVT a few years earlier. Investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 125 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 7.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 203 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 82 µmol/L (79-118)   INR 2.2 (2-3)   CXR No focal changes -   CTPA Subsegmental pulmonary emboli -   PaO2 8.2 kPa (10-13.3)   PaCO2 4.2 kPa (4.8-6.1)    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Add aspirin to her therapy,Add clopidogrel to her therapy,Increase the INR target to 3-4,Switch from warfarin to a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC).,Refer for an IVC filter,D,"In this situation, where she is anticoagulated yet has sustained a further PE, there are three potential choices, either to consider increasing her INR target to 3-4, starting a DOAC or considering an IVC filter. Contraindications to anticoagulation where an IVC filter may be considered include:  Haemorrhagic stroke Recent neurosurgery or other major surgery Major trauma, and Evidence of active internal bleeding.  Other contraindications include:  Pregnancy Frequent falls, and Poor potential compliance with warfarin.  In these situations an IVC filter may be the most appropriate option however it does not solve the problem of what to do in the future. Given her young age and the potential for further PEs, a filter may be considered ahead of increased warfarin dose, but given she has no contraindications to a DOAC this would be the most appropriate treatment. IVC filters may also be considered for prophylaxis in patients who have a diagnosis of cancer or who have a DVT and are about to undergo surgery. In this case, anticoagulation may result in more problems than filter placement. A previous relative contraindication to filter placement was the need to undergo MRI, but now, MRI proof filters are available and this is no longer a problem. "

Breastfeeding should continue in women being treated for H1N1 influenza • The H1N1 virus is not terratogenic but there some evidence that pyrexia in early pregnancy may be associated withan increased risk of neural tube defects"
basic medicine,1381,During a preoperative assessment you place your stethoscope over the second intercostal space to the right of the sternal margin. Which important structure are you auscultating?,The aortic valve,The cardiac apex,The mitral valve,The pulmonary valve,The tricuspid valve,A,This is the position for auscultation of the aortic valve. The pulmonary valve is best heard over the left side of the sternum at the second intercostal space and the tricuspid valve at the lower left quadrant of the body of the sternum in the fourth intercostal space. The mitral valve (mitral stenosis) is auscultated at the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line and the cardiac apex is palpated in the same position. Their positions can be remembered by the medical mnemonic  A. Place  To Meet For detailed descriptions of cardiac examination see any edition of Macleod's 'Clinical Examination'.
basic medicine,1382,Which of the following nerves can be damaged by incorrect on-table positioning?,Femoral nerve,Hypoglossal nerve,Phrenic nerve,Radial nerve,Sural nerve,D,"Nerves at risk during the peri-operative period include:  Optic nerve Ulnar nerve Radial nerve Saphenous nerve, and Common peroneal nerve.  The length of time spent in an abnormal position will increase the likelihood of problems. The eyes and optic nerves are at risk from direct pressure from surgical instruments and elbows resting over the face. The brachial plexus and its terminal branches are at risk from stretching or external pressure, particularly in the lateral position. The lithotomy position can damage the saphenous and common peroneal nerves by pressure from the poles. Neuronal injury is usually temporary and function returns with time, but occasionally damage is permanent."
basic medicine,1383,What is the likely cause of an alpha fetoprotein (AFP) concentration of 300 mU/L (reference range less than25 mU/L)?,Carcinoid syndrome,Cirrhosis of the liver,Colonic carcinoma with hepatic metastases,Hepatoma,Orchitis,D,"Causes of an elevated AFP include ovarian and testicular malignancies, hepatoma, pregnancy and choriocarcinoma.

basic medicine,1386,A 50-year-old man returns to your clinic three weeks after Botox treatment for horizontal forehead furrows. He now complains that his eyebrows are drooping (eyebrow ptosis). What is the cause of his complaint?,Increased forehead skin laxity,Paralysis of corrugators,Paralysis of frontalis,Paralysis of procerus,Paralysis of zygomaticus major,C,"Botox is a neurotoxin derived from the bacteria, Clostridium botulinum. It blocks neuromuscular transmission inhibition of acetylcholine release at the presynaptic membrane. The end result is that the muscle contraction is inhibited. The action of Botox is not permanent because collateral axonal sprouting establishes new neuromuscular junctions, restoring muscle function. Botox does not affect skin laxity, hence this answer option is wrong. Corrugator and procerus are both muscles that depress the eyebrow, therefore paralysis of these muscles would cause the opposite to eyebrow ptosis, hence paralysis of corrugators and paralysis of procerus are wrong. Zygomaticus major elevates and retracts the angle of mouth and does not affect the eyebrows, hence paralysis of zygomaticus major is wrong. Frontalis is a quadrilateral muscle found on the forehead that elevates the eyebrows; hence paralysis of this muscle can lead to eyebrow ptosis."

When the posterior cerebral artery is involved there may be cortical blindness and visual hallucinations and there may not be motor or sensory features.
basic medicine,1390,"A 76-year-old man with a recent history of cerebral haemorrhage 10 days ago is admitted with a cough, worsening breathlessness and right pleuritic chest pain. He is also mildly pyrexial. His ventilation-perfusion scan reveals several areas of perfusion deficit in the right lower zone, with a normal ventilation scan. What is the most appropriate line of management?",Aspirin therapy,Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC),Inferior vena cava (IVC) filter,Low molecular weight heparin treatment,Warfarin treatment,C,This patient has a pulmonary embolism (PE) following a recent haemorrhagic stroke. The most important thing to consider is when the stroke was and the extent of the bleed. Largely people with a cerebral haemorraheg should avoid any anticoagulation in the first 2-4 weeks. At this point the considreration of anticoagulation should be something short acting i.e LMWH or UFH infusion though again risk are still high of rebleeding. Use of the CHADS2VASC2 and HASBLED score should be used as well as consideraiton of platelets and renal function.  Warfarin would not be a good idea due to ti's long half life and a DOAC not adviseable due to to it's half life of around 24-48 hours. It also is not adviseable given the recent bleed. LMWH would be a potential option however initiating at prohylaxtic dose first would be suggested and escaltion to either split treatment dose or 50% dose coulld be considered. This should howvere be discussed with a specilist.  The risk of rebleeding into the stroke area is too high with anticoagulation in this case and so an IVC filter should be inserted and Ultrasound doppler of the legs to asses for any further clot.
basic medicine,1391,Which of the following is true regarding DNA structures?,Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are pyrimidine bases,Each amino acid is coded by one codon only,Each DNA strand has a pentose-phosphate backbone with projecting bases,"Guanine (G) always pairs with thymidine (T), and adenine (A) with cytosine (C)",There are 32 possible codons,C,"Pyrimidine bases are thymidine (T) and cytosine (C). G always pairs with C and T with A. Adenine (A) and guanine (G) are purine bases. There are 64 possible codons, and each amino acid may be coded by more than one codon. Watson and Crick proposed that the DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix, called a double helix. Base-pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine: namely, A pairs with T, and G pairs with C. In other words, adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. Adenine and thymine are connected by two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine and guanine are connected by three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, one strand will have the 3′ carbon of the sugar in the andquot;upwardandquot; position, whereas the other strand will have the 5′ carbon in the upward position. The diameter of the DNA double helix is uniform throughout because a purine (two rings) always pairs with a pyrimidine (one ring) and their combined lengths are always equal."

basic medicine,1398,What is the main peak change in oxygen consumption (VO2) in a pregnant women?,5%,20%,50%,130%,120%,B,"During healthy pregnancy, pulmonary function, ventilatory pattern and gas exchange are affected through both biochemical and mechanical pathwaysusually start to occur during the end of the first trimesterThe typical Oxygen Consumption (VO2) : 250 ml/min, during pregnancy this will increase by20% or 50ml/min- 300ml/min.Lung volumes changes during typical pregnancy:Oxygen Consumption increases by approximately 20% Total lung capacity reduced by approximately 5%. Expiratory Reserve Volume reduced by approximately 20% Tidal volume is increased by approximately 50%. Functional residual capacity reduced by term by approximately 20%. Uterine enlargement displaces the diaphragm upwards by up to 4cm Gravid uterus enlargement limits the movement of the thoracic cage causing shortness of breath. Minute ventilation increase by about 50% during 1st trimester. pH remains normal or increases slightly due to renal compensation: HCO3- decreases FEV1 and FVC remain the same. PCO2 decreases. PO2 increases.Progesterone Progesterone gradually increases during the course of pregnancy, from 25 ng⋅mL−1 at 6 weeks’ to 150 ng⋅mL−1 at 37 weeks’ gestation. Progesterone acts as trigger of the primary respiratory center by increasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide, as indicated by the steeper slope of the ventilation curve in response to alveolar carbon dioxide changes. Progesterone alters the smooth muscle tone of the airways resulting in a bronchodilator effect. It also mediates hyperaemia and oedema of mucosal surfaces, causing nasal congestion.Oestrogen The circulating levels of oestrogen increase during pregnancy, before or in parallel to those of progesterone. Oestrogen is a mediator of progesterone receptors. It increases the number and the sensitivity of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla, the central neuronal respiratory-related areas.Prostaglandins Prostaglandins stimulate uterine smooth muscle during labour and are present during all three trimesters of pregnancy. Prostaglandin F2α increases airway resistance by bronchial smooth muscle constriction, whereas a bronchodilator effect can be a consequence of prostaglandins E1 and E2."

Which type of reaction has this woman experienced?,Type I hypersensitivity,Type II hypersensitivity,Type III hypersensitivity,Type IV hypersensitivity,Type V hypersensitivity,A,"This lady has had an anaphylactic reaction. This is a type I reaction (immediate) and is mediated by the binding of the antigen and IgE on mast cells; other examples would include latex allergy, and non-anaphylactic type I reactions include asthma and allergic rhinitis. Type II reactions involve antibody (usually (IgG) to cell-bound antigen causing cell destruction, for example, haemolysis following blood transfusion. Type III reaction results from the deposition of immune complexes in tissues (IgG), for example, acute post-streptoccoal glomerulonephritis. Type IV reactions are caused by T lymphocytes which react with antigen producing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction. For example: Heaf test for in immunised individuals. There is no Type V reaction."

basic medicine,1409,A 17-year-old woman presented six hours after taking 30 g of paracetamol. Which of the following factors is most likely to predict an increased risk of hepatotoxicity from the paracetamol?,Anorexia nervosa,Consumption of 20 units of alcohol since taking the paracetamol,Gilbert's disease,Ingestion of amitriptyline with the paracetamol,Smoking 20 cigarettes per day,A,"The MHRA updated its guidelines on the treatment of paracetamol overdose in 2012. Previously, healthcare professionals were advised to assess for risk factors of hepatotoxicity and therefore were two lines on the treatment nomogram (one for patients with risk factors, and one for those without). A review found that the evidence base to support the use of risk factors was poor and inconsistent, and that many of the risk factors were imprecise and difficult to determine with sufficient certainty in clinical practice. All patients with a timed plasma paracetamol level on or above a single treatment line joining points of 100 mg/L at 4 hours and 15 mg/L at 15 hours after ingestion should receive acetylcysteine based on the new treatment nomogram, regardless of risk factors for hepatotoxicity. However, it is still important to know what the risk factors for hepatotoxicity are. These include:  malnourished patients (anorexia nervosa/bulimia nervosa) patients taking enzyme inducing drugs (e.g. carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin and St John's wort) patients with induced liver enzymes due to chronic ethanol abuse human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive patients.

basic medicine,1413,"In one gene mapping technique, denatured deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from metaphase chromosomes is hybridised with a radioactively labelled probe. This DNA is then exposed to film to reveal the approximate chromosomal location of the DNA in the probe. Which technique does this best describe?",Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH),In situ hybridisation,Single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis,Somatic cell hybridisation,Southern blotting,B,"The technique described is 'in situ hybridisation'. It uses a labelled complementary DNA or RNA probe to localise a specific sequence within a tissue. Firstly, the tissues are treated to fix the target, then the probe is added. This then hybridises to the target, following which, excess probe is washed away. In the classical form, the probe is labelled with radio-labelled bases, which can then be identified using plain film. FISH is a form of in situ hybridisation in which the probe is labelled with fluorescent bases, which can then be visualised under a fluorescent microscope. Southern blotting is a laboratory procedure in which DNA fragments that have been electrophoresed through a gel are transferred to a solid membrane, such as nitrocellulose. The DNA can then be hybridised with a labelled probe and exposed to x ray film. Somatic cell hybridisation is a physical gene mapping technique in which somatic cells from two different species are fused and allowed to undergo cell division. Chromosomes from one species are selectively lost, resulting in clones with only one or a few chromosomes from one of the species. SSCP is a technique for detecting variation in DNA sequence by running single-stranded DNA fragments through a non-denaturing gel. Fragments with differing secondary structure (conformation) caused by sequence variation will migrate at different rates. "

basic medicine,1415,Which is true of oxytocin?,Causes milk ejection,Is a large polypeptide,Is released directly into the circulation from its site of production,Is synthesised in the posterior pituitary,Relaxes the uterus,A,Oxytocin is synthesised in the hypothalamus and passes down the nerve axons to the posterior pituitary to be released into circulation. The other hormone released by the posterior pituitary is antidiuretic hormone. Oxytocin is involved in the control of smooth muscle contraction in the uterus and milk release from the lactating breast (the 'milk ejection reflex'). Oxytocin is a small peptide containing 9 amino acids.
basic medicine,1416,You are asked to see a 26 year old patient following her first visit to antenatal clinic. She is 9 weeks pregnant and bloods have shown her to be non-immune to Rubella. She is concerned about congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). What is the most appropriate advice to give?,Advise vaccination as soon as possible,Advise vaccination after birth and when breast feeding has ceased,Reassure that CRS is the result of infection during the first 6 weeks of pregnancy,Advise vaccination after birth regardless of breast feeding status,Advise vaccination prior to 16 weeks gestation,D,"Congenital rubella infection that occurs after 16 weeks gestation does not typically cause fetal abnormalities. This however plays no part in vaccination advice. Rubella vaccine is live and should not be given during pregnancy. The mother should be offered vaccination after giving birth. It is safe for the vaccine (typically given as combined MMR) to be administered if the mother is breastfeeding. Rubella Rubella Key PointsCaused by Rubella virus: A togavirus Single-stranded RNA genome Transmission primarily via the respiratory route Viral replication occurs in the nasopharynx and lymph nodes Rubella infection in children and adults usually mild Incubation period range 12-23 days (average 14 days) Congenital rubella infection teratogenic with poor prognosis and significant complications (sensorineural deafness, cataracts and cardiac abnormalities most common) No specific treatment. Key is prevention through vaccination programme Vaccination is via live attenuated virus so cannot be given to pregnant women who are found to be non-immune."

basic medicine,1420,A patient presents with erythema nodosum and is found to have bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Which biochemical abnormality is associated with this?,Hyperkalaemia,Hypokalaemia,Hyponatraemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypercalcaemia,E,The presence of erythema nodosum and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is highly suggestive of Sarcoidosis and this can cause hypercalcaemia due to the extra hydroxylation of vitamin D by macrophages in the granulomatous tissue.
basic medicine,1421,The action of noradrenaline released at sympathetic nerve endings is terminated by which of the following?,Enzymatic decarboxylation,Enzymatic inactivation by catechol-O-methyl transferase,Oxidative deamination by monoamine oxidase,Removal by the circulating blood,Re-uptake of noradrenaline (NA) by the axonal terminals,E,A popular question for the examination but simple physiology gets the right answer here. The effects of neurotransmitter release are principally terminated by neuronal uptake. Intraneuronal NA is usually taken back up into the neurosecretory granules and a small amount is metabolised by monoamine oxidase (MAO). Even smaller quantities that escape into the circulation are metabolised by catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT).
basic medicine,1422,A 58-year-old male presents with painful breast tissue. Six weeks previously he was treated for atrial fibrillation and had a number of drugs commenced. Which one of the following drugs may have caused this problem?,Aspirin,bisoprolol,Flecainide,Spironolactone,Warfarin,D,"TIn the setting of atrial fibrillation spironolactone may be used if the patient is thought to be in heart failure (which is fairly common with atrial fibrillation). In addition, spironolactone has been shown to reduce the recurrence rate of atrial fibrillation following cardioversion and so it is possible it would be started for this reason. Spironolactone causes gynaecomastia by several mechanisms. It can block androgen production by inhibiting enzymes in the testosterone synthetic pathway, and can also block recceptor binding of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone. In addition, it displaces oestradiol from sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), which increases free oestrogen levels."

basic medicine,1424,A pregnant woman is referred with an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level. Her other liver function tests are normal. She is otherwise well. What is the most likely cause?,Autoimmune hepatitis,Bone metatases,Paget's disease,Placental production of ALP,Transient hyperphosphatasia of infancy,D,"Alkaline phosphatase is a common part of the liver function tests and is an enzyme occurring in many different tissues throughout the body. The causes of an elevated ALP are therefore quite diverse. In practice, most abnormalities of ALP concentration relate to isoenzymes from the liver or bone but the placenta also can make ALP. Thus in pregnant women ALP levels are usually two to three times higher than non-pregnant values: this is quite normal. In childhood elevated ALP levels signify bone growth and are usually physiological, not pathological. Transient hyperphosphatasia of infancy involves more dramatic elevations of ALP (up to ten times normal) which is thought to be benign in nature and resolves after three to four months. It affects children aged around 2 to 4-years-old. Liver disease: ALP is closely associated with the biliary canaliculi in the liver and will rise with any form of hepatobiliary obstruction, particularly with extrahepatic causes such as pancreatic carcinoma or a gallstone in the common bile duct. When drainage of bile is obstructed ALP synthesis increases dramatically. Liver diseases which predominantly cause hepatocellular damage (such as viral or autoimmune hepatitis) rather than biliary obstruction will cause a lesser degree of ALP elevation. Bone disease: ALP aids in the calcification process in bone and is found in osteoblasts. ALP can therefore be abnormal in any disease affecting bone turnover and calcification, including Paget's disease, vitamin D deficiency, primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone malignancies and fracture healing. Paget's disease involves increased bone turnover and is a relatively common finding in older patients (more than 50-years-old). It can be asymptomatic or can be associated with tender bone/skull over-growth, sensorineural deafness, pathological fractures and rarely, high output cardiac failure."

His father had a heart attack aged 41, his grandfather died of a heart attack aged 58 and 2 of his uncles have had heart attacks in their 40s. What is the most likely genetic background?",Hyperhomocysteinaemia,Familial hypercholesterolaemia,Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency,Familial hypertriglyceridemia,Familial apoprotein CII deficiency,B,Familial hypercholesterolaemia is genetic defect in which the LDL receptor is abnormal which results in high levels of serum LDL and thus increasing cardiovascular disease. Hyperhomocysteinaemia does increase cardiovascular risk but not to the extent of familial hypercholesterolaemia. The other conditions do not increase cardiovascular risk significantly.
basic medicine,1427,The intracranial pressure is decreased by which of the following?,A rise in the arterial pCO2,Hypoventilation,Intravenous furosemide,Placing the patient in a head-up position,The administration of sodium nitroprusside,D,Mannitol is an osmotic diuretic which is used in cerebral oedema. A typical dose is 1 g/kg as a 20% solution given by rapid intravenous infusion. Its use is controversial as its presumed benefits have not been subjected to clinical trials. If the body is accelerated upward (positive g) then blood moves toward the feet and arterial pressure at the level of the head decreases. 30 degrees is the optimal position. Hyperventilation causes hypocapnia and this causes a reduction in cerebral blood flow because of the direct constrictor effect of hypocapnia on the cerebral vessels. Sodium nitroprusside is used in hypertensive encephalopathy to reduce blood pressure. It can increase the intracranial pressure through vasodilatation.

basic medicine,1469,On which part of the renal system does antidiuretic hormone (ADH) act?,Bowman's capsule,Collecting duct,Descending thin limb,Glomerulus,Proximal convoluted tubule,B,ADH is released in response to an increase in blood osmolarity detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. It acts on the collecting duct (and also the distal convoluted tubule and ascending loop of Henle). It increases the uptake of water in the kidney thereby increasing the urine concentration and reducing urine output. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a physiological response to surgery and it is therefore important to understand the mechanism of ADH.

basic medicine,1474,Which of the following is correct regarding the vermiform appendix?,Averages 5 cm in length,Is supplied by branches of the right colic artery,Its position is pelvic in 30% of adults,Opens at the apex of the caecum,The circular muscle layer is a continuation of the three taeniae coli,C,"The appendix has an average length of 9 cm (range from 2-20 cm). The wall of the appendix consists of an inner circular and outer longitudinal layer of muscle. The longitudinal layer is a continuation of the three taeniae coli. The appendix is lined by colonic epithelium. The blood supply to the appendix is from the appendicular artery, which is a branch of the ileocolic artery. This artery courses through the mesoappendix posterior, to the terminal ileum. The terminal part of the artery is within the wall of the appendix. This may explain how appendicitis causes thrombosis of the artery and gangrene of the appendix. The opening of the appendix is fairly constant and is located at the posteromedial wall of the caecum about 2.5 cm below the ileocaecal valve. This is also where the taeniae converge. The foetal position of the opening, up to birth, is at the apex of the caecum. The position of the tip of the appendix varies. In 65% of patients the tip is located in a retrocaecal position; in 31% it hangs over the brim of the lesser pelvis. Here it will be close to the right fallopian tube and ovary in the female. The appendix is subcaecal in 2%, and behind or in front of the terminal ileum in 2%. The location of the tip of the appendix influences symptoms and signs."
basic medicine,1475,The following increases during pregnancy?,Total Lung Capacity,Expiratory Reserve Volume,Functional Residual Capacity,Tidal Volume,Vital Capacity,D,"increases by approximately 50% Changes during typical pregnancy:Oxygen Consumption increases by approximately 20% Total lung capacity reduced by approximately 5%. Expiratory Reserve Volume reduced by approximately 20% Tidal volume is increased by approximately 50%. Functional residual capacity reduced by term by approximately 20%. Uterine enlargement displaces the diaphragm upwards by up to 4cm Gravid uterus enlargement limits the movement of the thoracic cage causing shortness of breath. Minute ventilation increase by about 50% during 1st trimester. pH remains normal or increases slightly due to renal compensation: HCO3- decreases FEV1 and FVC remain the same. PCO2 decreases. PO2 increases.Progesterone Progesterone gradually increases during the course of pregnancy, from 25 ng⋅mL−1 at 6 weeks’ to 150 ng⋅mL−1 at 37 weeks’ gestation. Progesterone acts as trigger of the primary respiratory center by increasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide, as indicated by the steeper slope of the ventilation curve in response to alveolar carbon dioxide changes. Progesterone alters the smooth muscle tone of the airways resulting in a bronchodilator effect. It also mediates hyperaemia and oedema of mucosal surfaces, causing nasal congestion.Oestrogen The circulating levels of oestrogen increase during pregnancy, before or in parallel to those of progesterone. Oestrogen is a mediator of progesterone receptors. It increases the number and the sensitivity of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla, the central neuronal respiratory-related areas.Prostaglandins Prostaglandins stimulate uterine smooth muscle during labour and are present during all three trimesters of pregnancy. Prostaglandin F2α increases airway resistance by bronchial smooth muscle constriction, whereas a bronchodilator effect can be a consequence of prostaglandins E1 and E2."
basic medicine,1476,what is the predominant cell type found in the wound during days 3-4 during the inflammatory phase of wound healing?,Macrophages,Polymorphonuclear Neutrophils (PMNs),Natural killer Cells,Lymphocytes,Monocytes,A,"PMNs typically undergo apoptosis after 48 hours. PMNs phagocytise debris and kill bacteria via free radicals (AKA respiratory burst). They also break down damaged tissue. They are then engulfed and degraded by macrophages. Macrophages therefore become the predominant cell type in the wound on days 3-4. Wound Healing Wound healing is typically divided into four phases. The four phases of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase: This is the initial phase that starts immediately after the injury occurs. The body's response involves vasoconstriction and the formation of a blood clot .Inflammatory Phase: Following hemostasis, the inflammatory phase begins and can last for several days. During this phase, the body triggers an inflammatory response to remove debris, foreign substances, and bacteria from the wound. Immune cells, growth factors, and other chemicals are released to initiate the healing process.Proliferative Phase: After the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase starts, lasting for several weeks. New tissue is formed through the action of fibroblasts, which produce collagen, and other cells. The wound is filled with granulation tissue, which contains new blood vessels and collagen.Remodeling Phase: The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase. It can last for several months to years after the injury. During this phase, the collagen fibers reorganize and gain strength, and the wound contracts and becomes smaller. The goal is to improve the wound's tensile strength and functionality, although it may not reach the original strength of the uninjured tissue entirely."

basic medicine,1511,"A 32-year-old woman who has a history of Crohn's disease which is managed with a stable dose of azathioprine as her only medication comes to the clinic for review. She has not had a flare of her disease for more than 2 years, and is wishing to try for a baby. Her Crohn's is quiescent, with no significant abdominal pain, and bowel opening 2-3 times per day with normal motion. Clinical examination is unremarkable with a BMI of 23, and routine bloods including FBC and LFTs are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action with respect to her medication?",Continue azathioprine,Stop azathioprine,Switch to infliximab,Switch to mesalazine,Switch to prednisolone,A,"The answer is Continue azathioprine. Due to the difficulties of running trials which include pregnant women, there is no high-quality evidence that azathioprine is linked with congenital malformations when used in pregnancy. A small increase in atrial defects was seen in women who took the drug in pregnancy for inflammatory bowel disease versus controls with IBD alone in a retrospective case control study, but there were possible confounding factors. Low birth weight, miscarriage and premature delivery have been noted, but may be due to active disease rather than azathioprine. Current UK guidelines therefore state that azathioprine is considered to be low risk in pregnancy, and it is felt the benefit outweighs the risk as having active disease during pregnancy is likely to have a greater detrimental impact on foetal development. There is less evidence to support use of infliximab in pregnancy, but it is also considerd to be low-risk, however as this lady has stable disease it is not indicated. Corticosteroids are considered safe in pregnancy, as the amounts crossing the placenta are low, but the effects on the mother should be considered and again it is not indicated here as the disease is stable. Mesalazine is thought to be a relatively safe option in pregnancy, although it may be associated with low birth weight and increased risk of pre-term delivery. As this lady\'s disease is stable on azathioprine, you would not risk a flare by changing her medication at this point. "

Which of her medications is most likely to cause this:,Amlodipine,Atorvastatin,Lansoprazole,Cetirizine,Ramipril,E,"Ramipril is an ACE inhibitor. ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme) converts Angiotensin 1 to Angiotensin 2 and also plays a role in Bradykinin breakdown. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor causes Bradykinin levels to rise and this can result in a dry cough. About 1 in 10 people treated with an ACEi will develop a cough. Cardiac Medications Below are some common and important side effects encountered with commonly used medications. The lists are not exhaustive but should highlight side effects that you may be asked about in the exam.ACE inhibitors eg RamiprilDry Cough (10%) Joint aches Postural hypotension (infrequent) Renal Impairment (rare) Angio-odema (rare)NOTE: Avoid in Pregnancy as skull defects, oligohydramnios and altered neonatal BP and renal blood flow reported.Loop Diuretics eg FurosemidePostural Hypotension Hyponatraemia Hypokalaemia Hypocalcaemia and Hypomagnesaemia Gastrointestinal upsetCalcium Channel Blockers eg AmlodipinePeripheral oedema Abdominal pain Nausea FatigueNOTE The BNF advises most calcium channel blockers be avoided in pregnancy as they may inhibit labour and some have shown toxicity in animal studiesBeta Blockers eg labetalolBronchospasm Cold extremities Alteration in glycaemic control BradycardiaNOTE Labetalol has not been shown to be harmful except possibly in the 1st trimester.

basic medicine,1515,Which of the following muscle tendons is part of the rotator cuff of the shoulder?,Deltoid,Latissimus dorsi,Subclavius,Teres major,Teres minor,E,"The rotator cuff is an important structure in the shoulder joint which helps in stabilising the humeral head within the glenoid, particularly when the arm is flexed or abducted by the deltoid muscle. It is formed by a sheath of conjoint tendons which run over the top of the shoulder capsule and insert into the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The tendons which make up the rotator cuff of the shoulder are:  Supraspinatus Infraspinatus Teres minor, and Subscapularis.  Supraspinatus inserts into the tip of the greater tuberosity of the humerus. It is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm. Infraspinatus inserts just behind and below the tip of the tuberosity. It helps in external rotation of the arm. Teres minor is completely hidden beneath the deltoid, as it passes behind the origin of the triceps to get inserted at the greater tuberosity of the humerus. Subscapularis is the only rotator cuff muscle that gets inserted into the lesser tuberosity of the humerus. Latissimus dorsi and coracobracilis do not play any part in the formation of the rotator cuff."

Examination reveals facial weakness affecting the left side of his face, including his forehead. He also has a prominent hard lump which is tethering the skin below his external auditory meatus behind the ramus of the mandible. What is the most likely cause for his facial weakness from the list below?",Adenocarcinoma of the parotid gland,Cerebrovascular accident,Pleomorphic adenoma of the parotid gland,Ramsay Hunt syndrome,Sub-mandibular pleomorphic adenoma,A,"This gentleman has a facial nerve paralysis. The fact that this affects his whole face suggests lower motor neuron weakness rather than upper, which spares the muscles of the forehead. The site of lump suggests disease of the parotid gland, through which the facial nerve runs. Benign parotid disease does not cause facial nerve palsy."
basic medicine,1518,Which is true in a normal muscle fibre?,Calcium reuptake is a passive process,Muscle contraction is terminated by the efflux of calcium out of the sarcolemma,The action potential lasts 10 ms,The resting membrane potential is −10 mV,Troponin bound to calcium allows actin to form cross bridges with myosin,E,"The normal resting membrane potential is −90 mV. Motor neurone stimulation depolarises the sarcolemma via the end-plate (the action potential lasting 2-4 ms), and calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calcium ions bind to troponin, which results in the tropomyosin moving to reveal the myosin binding site on the actin filament. This unblocks actin. Cross-bridges bind actin with myosin and thus cause muscle contraction. Cross-bridge formation is energy dependent (utilising ATP), and is inhibited by low sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ion concentrations. Muscle relaxation occurs by the re-uptake of calcium ions by the SR (not efflux out of the SR) and it is an active process."

basic medicine,1521,You are asked to review a 71-year-old woman who comes to the clinic complaining that her hearing is not as good as it was after a prolonged period of treatment in hospital for infective endocarditis. On examination you find that she has significant sensorineural hearing impairment and you suspect this may be gentamicin related. What is the mechanism of ototoxicity associated with gentamicin?,Cell wall integrity disruption,DNA toxicity,Interruption of cell division,Nitric oxide reduction,Oxygen free radical generation,E,"Gentamicin is toxic to cochlear hair cells, and it is known to disrupt mitochondrial protein synthesis, which leads to increased oxygen free radical generation via inducible nitric oxide synthase activity. Peroxynitrite radicals are formed, which then leads to apoptosis. It is thought that aminoglycosides take longer to clear from inner ear fluids, which may account for the site specific toxicity seen with this class of antibiotics. A switch from BD dosing to OD dosing has reduced the susceptibility of patients to toxicity, and once daily regimes are now the preferred method of gentamicin administration. Peak (one hour post dose), and trough, (pre-dose levels) are assayed to determine dose adjustments. A dose of 3 mg/kg/day is the usual starting level in adults with normal renal function. Gentamicin may be used in patients with impaired renal function, but dose level and interval between doses needs to be adjusted to avoid toxicity."
basic medicine,1522,Which is true of the physics of ultrasound?,Acoustic enhancement occurs with solid structures,"The A mode is used to judge the depth of an organ, or otherwise assess an organ's dimensions.",The sound travels well through air,The velocity is independent of the temperature of the material through which it travels,Ultrasound waves pass more slowly through denser materials,B,The velocity of the ultrasound is dependent on the compressibility of the medium through which it travels and the density. The greater the compressibility the slower the velocity. Compressibility is affected by temperature and hence this too will affect velocity of ultrasound.

basic medicine,1525,Which of the following is true of co-trimoxazole?,It is safe to use in pregnancy,It is safe to use with ACE inhibitors,It is safe to use with clopidogrel,It is safe to use with methotrexate,It is safe to use with warfarin,C,"Co-trimoxazole is a combination of sulphonamide and trimethoprim, with synergistic bacteriostatic effect through inhibition of folic acid synthesis. MIMS states that it has 'bacteriocidal effects' but it should be considered to be bacteriostatic. Because of its effect on folic acid metabolism (synergistic by each component acting on successive stages of folate metabolism) it is teratogenic in early pregnancy. Hyperkalaemia is a side effect. This may be increased in patients taking ACE inhibitors. It potentiates the effects of warfarin (like erythromycin, isoniazid). Sulphamethoxazole is a strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 which is the main liver enzyme involved in the metabolism of warfarin. The sulphonamide component can displace methotrexate from its plasma protein binding site. There is also an increased risk of haematological toxicity. "
basic medicine,1526,"Regarding leg ulcers, which of the following is true?",Diuretics have been shown to be of benefit in the treatment of associated oedema,In diabetic ulcers the dressing should be left in situ for no more than one week,Large gravitational ulcers are always painful,Treating superficial infection with antibiotics has been shown to be beneficial,Ulcers caused by arterial disease are typically treated by compression bandaging,B,"Diabetics often have some element of neuropathy. This means that significant progression of ulceration/infection may not be noticed by the patient. Frequent checks of the ulcers are essential. Diuretics are only used to treat oedema of general cause (e.g. in congestive cardiac failure). They do not accelerate healing. Leg ulcers are not necessarily always painful, and there is no evidence to indicate that treatment with antibiotics accelerates healing. Arterial ulcers should not be treated with compression bandages."

In deep forced inspiration, every muscle that can raise the ribs is brought into action, including the scalenus anterior and medius and the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The internal intercostals are muscles of expiration. Latissimus dorsi has no role in normal inspiration or expiration. It can (if the arms are fixed), act as an accessory muscle in forced expiration. Normal expiration is mainly passive. Serratus posterior inferior has a minor role in pulling down the lower ribs. The rectus abdominus and all muscles of the abdominal wall, aid forced expiration by pushing the relaxing diaphragm upwards, and pulling the ribs down and inwards."

basic medicine,1529,"A 57-year-old man with a history of stable coronary artery disease comes to the clinic for review. He suffered an inferior myocardial infarction some seven years earlier, but has been troubled with only relatively minor chest pain since this time. He takes a number of medications for control of blood pressure, cholesterol and his angina. On examination his BP is 145/72 mmHg, pulse is 70 and regular. His chest is clear and there is no ankle swelling. He tells you that he has been buying sildenafil over the internet for erectile dysfunction. Which of the following medications would concern you most with respect to possible drug interaction?",Atorvastatin,Bisoprolol,Indapamide,Nicorandil,Ramipril,D,"Sildenafil leads to significant hypotension with nitrates and drugs such as nicorandil which act as nitrate donors. As such it is contraindicated for use with these agents. Atorvastatin, bisoprolol, indapamide and ramipril are all commonly prescribed in patients with erectile dysfunction and no significant interaction with PDE-5 inhibitors is recognised. Alpha blockers may lead to hypotension in patients prescribed sildenafil and caution is therefore advised where co-prescription is considered. Sildenafil is metabolised via the CYP3A4 pathway, as such caution is also advised when co-prescribing agents such as erythromycin and increased consumption of grapefruit juice."
basic medicine,1530,An 85-year-old woman presented with bilateral osteoarthritis of the knees. She had no history of previous gastrointestinal disease. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for her?,Celecoxib,Dihydrocodeine,Naproxen,Paracetamol,Glucosamine,D,"NICE guidelines recommend formulating individualised management plans for patients with osteoarthritis. Behavioural change, such as exercise, weight loss and suitable footwear should be encouraged. Comorbidities which compound the effect of osteoarthritis symptoms should be identified and their treatment optimised. Paracetamol and/or topical NSAIDs (for knee or hand OA) should be offered before considering oral NSAIDs. If symptoms are not controlled with the above strategies, oral NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors (but not etoricoxib) can be used. A proton pump inhibitor should be co-prescribed. The lowest effective dose should be prescribed for the shortest period possible. If the patient is already taking low-dose aspirin, an alternative analgesic should be considered. Treatments which are not recommended include rubefacients, intra-articular hyaluronan, electro-acupuncture and chondroitin or glucosamine products. Adjuvants which can be used include opioid analgesics, topical capsaicin and intra-articular corticosteroids. Application of heat or cold packs, or TENS, can be considered if other strategies are ineffective. Manipulation and stretching can be helpful, particularly for hip osteoarthritis. Bracing/joint supports can be used for patients with biomechanical joint pain or instability. Patients should be referred for joint surgery if they have already been offered all of the core treatments or if they have refractory joint symptoms which have a substantial impact on their quality of life. If there is a clear history of mechanical locking, referral for arthroscopic lavage and debridement should be considered. "
basic medicine,1531,Which drug combination should be avoided?,Aspirin and clopidogrel,Ethanol and co-amoxiclav,Metformin and chlorpropamide,Sildenafil and isosorbide mononitrate,Simvastatin and fenofibrate,D,"Sildenafil and isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) combined may cause a profound hypotension. Aspirin and clopidogrel are used successfully together in trials of ischaemic heart disease, reducing all cause mortality more than the single agent alone. Antidiabetic medication frequently consists of metformin plus a sulphonylurea such as chlorpropamide or glibenclamide. Statin therapy and fibrates are used in combined hyperlipidaemia although there is an increased risk of myositis associated with the combined agents versus monotherapy."

Most reported deaths occurred in women who developed pneumonia and acute respiratorydistress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation• Risk of morbidity from seasonal flu is also higher during pregnancy• The risk is highest in the third trimester compared to early pregnancy or post-partum• Women with asthma and morbid obesity appear to be at higher risk of severe disease• Most current data from UKOSS indicates that pregnant women admitted to ITU were less likely to have been treatedwith antiviral agents within 2 days of the onset of symptoms when compared with other pregnant women who wereadmitted to hospital. This indicates the importance of prompt treatment• H1N1 infection is associated with pre-term delivery, especially in women admitted to ITU • Vertical transmission of H1N1 influenza has not been reported and the virus is not known to be present in breastmilk. Breastfeeding should continue in women being treated for H1N1 influenza• The H1N1 virus is not terratogenic but there some evidence that pyrexia in early pregnancy may be associated withan increased risk of neural tube defects"
basic medicine,1533,You are taking ward referrals on behalf of the renal team and are asked to see a 24-year-old woman who has been undergoing chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukaemia. Unfortunately over the past 24 hours her condition has deteriorated and she is now oliguric; this is associated with a rise in her creatinine to 420 µmol/l (79-118). Which of the following treatments would have been most effective in preventing this episode?,Colchicine,IV normal saline,Naproxen,Prednisolone,Rasburicase,E,"Tumour lysis syndrome is recognised after the onset of chemotherapy in patients with acute leukaemia. Whilst ensuring adequate hydration and alkalinisation of urine is of value, rasburicase, (recombinant urate oxidase) is effective when used both pre and post the onset of chemotherapy in reducing urate accumulation. The commonest reported side effect of rasburicase therapy is fever associated with administration and rasburicase overdose may lead to accumulation of hydrogen peroxide. It is important to check a patient G6PD status and wheter they are deficicent as rasburciase in G6PD deficicency leads to profuse haemolysis.  Other options for the management of tumour lysis syndrome include  Prophylactic allopurinol Acetazolamide to drive urine alkalinisation. Intravenous fluid"
basic medicine,1534,The ureters receive autonomic supply from which spinal segments?,L2-L5,L1-L4,T11-L2,T10-T12,S1-S3,C,The ureters receive innervation by a number of nerve plexuses. The nerves supplying the ureters originate from spinal segments T11 to L2. When you think about ureteric colic giving classic 'loin to groin' pain it is because the pain is referred to these dermatomes
basic medicine,1535,Which of the following is a common feature of metabolic acidosis?,High pCO2 concentration,High plasma bicarbonate concentration,Hyperkalaemia,Hyponatraemia,Low hydrogen ion concentration,C,"A metabolic acidosis is associated with a low pH and hence high plasma hydrogen ion concentration. As a buffering system, HCO3 is typically reduced and pCO2 is decreased in an effort to compensate and induce a respiratory alkalosis. Similarly, there is increased renal excretion of hydrogen ions with potassium excretion. The increased hydrogen concentrations are also responsible for an efflux of potassium from the intracellular reservoir."

Shingles iscontagious• Infection in pregnancy is more severe, with 10% risk of pneumonitis and up to 6% mortality • 2% risk of congenital varicella syndrome (dermatomal scarring, cataract, limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, learningdisability..) if infection occurs BEFORE 20 weeks gestation. No risk of congenital anomalies after 28 weeks • Infection results in life-long immunity.• There is no effective vaccine currently available• Infection can be prevented by passive immunisation with varicella zoster immune globulin – not life-long • 85% of pregnant women are immune (UK) • Severe neonatal disease likely (30%) if maternal disease develops within 4 days of delivery – neonate has notacquired maternal antibodies• Sensitive to acyclovir – useful in severe disease"
basic medicine,1537,"A 58 year old gentleman presents with a history of weight loss. He has lost 2 stones in weight over the last 6 months. He is complaining of a chronic cough. He was previously a heavy smoker but has not smoked for over 3 years. He has no other symptoms. He suffers from hypertension and is on bendroflumethiazide for which he has been on for years. He is found to have a sodium of 127 mmol/l with normal urea, creatinine and potassium. His sodium level had been normal 6 months ago. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his hyponatraemia?",SIADH,Hypothyroidism,Renal Failure,Bendroflumethiazide,Addison's Disease,A,This patient is likely to be suffering from lung cancer. Small cell lung cancer is commonly associated with SIADH. Bendroflumethiazide can lead to hyponatraemia however he has been on this for many years and you would have expected it to have been found prior to this.
basic medicine,1538,A 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) is treated with fludarabine as single agent chemotherapy to control her symptoms. You counsel her as to the increased risk of infections. The risk of which infection is particularly increased in patients treated with fludarabine?,Candida albicans,Herpes simplex,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Staphylococcus aureus,Tuberculosis,B,"The answer is Herpes simplex. Fludarabine has the greatest effect on T cell function. There is inhibition of cytokine-induced activation of STAT-1 and STAT-1-dependent gene transcription, which results in decreased peripheral blood T cell counts. These occur early in treatment and persist for up to two years after discontinuation of therapy. A greater impact is seen on CD4+ T cells than CD8+ T cells or NK cells. Decreased B cell and monocyte counts are also seen. This alteration in T cell function leads to increased susceptibility to the herpes family of viruses, including herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus. Chlorambucil is most associated with increased risk of common bacterial infections including pseudomonas, staphylococcus and streptococcus. Increased risk of fungal infections is also seen. TNF-alpha inhibitors used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease are particularly associated with tuberculosis reactivation. The introduciton with targeted agents such as Bruton's Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors (BTKi) in CLL have a much less severe effect on T cell depletion and function."
basic medicine,1539,Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC):,Can distinguish between a follicular adenoma and a follicular carcinoma,Has replaced radionuclide scanning as the procedure of choice in evaluating thyroid nodules,No longer forms part of the triple assessment of a breast lump,Of a branchial cyst produces a serous fluid,Requires ultrasound guidance,B,"The key factor which distinguishes a follicular adenoma from a carcinoma is invasion of the capsule. A FNAC does not supply this information. A branchial cyst produces an opalescent fluid containing cholesterol crystals or frank pus. All patients presenting with a breast lump should have a clinical examination, a radiological examination (ultrasound if under 35 years or a mammogram if over 35 years) and either an FNAC or a biopsy. The needle is advanced into the lesion and suction applied as the needle is moved in different directions within the mass (stereotactic). In the hands of an experienced cytopathologist the technique is very accurate with a 1% false positive and a 5% false negative rate."

At admission his oxygen saturations were 85% on air and a chest x ray revealed bilateral patchy infiltration of both lung fields with a cardiothoracic ratio of 20/30 cm. Which of the following drugs that he has been prescribed is most likely to explain these findings?,Amiodarone ,Aspirin ,Atorvastatin,Furosemide ,Ramipril ,A,"This patient has desaturation with patchy infiltration on CXR suggesting a diagnosis of amiodarone-induced lung disease. Usually the presentation is insidious and the disorder associated with the cumulative dose. Treatment depends on withdrawing amiodarone and initiation of steroid therapy. Differential diagnosis is any lymphangitis/pnemonitis but high resolution CT can help by demonstration of radio-dense plaques, etc."
basic medicine,1541,Which HPV subtypes are responsible for around 70% of HPV related cancers?,1 and 2,6 and 8,8 and 12,12 and 16,16 and 18,E,"HPV Gardasil® is a quadrivalent vaccine against HPV Types 6, 11, 16, and 18HPV types16 and 18 are responsible for 70% of cases of HPV related cancers. They are considered the most important high risk genotypes of HPV. As well as cervical cancer they are associated with cancers of the oropharynx and anogenital region. There are over 100 genotypes of HPV including several other high risk HPV types. HPV is thought to induce cancer via onco-proteins. The primary onco-proteins are E6 and E7 which inactivate two tumor suppressor proteins, p53 (inactivated by E6) and pRb (inactivated by E7)HPV genotypes 6 and 11 are low risk and cause anogenital warts. Typically 70% of HPV infections are cleared within 1 year and 90% are cleared within 2 years"
basic medicine,1542,A patient with Hodgkin's lymphoma undergoes mantle field radiotherapy. Several months later the patient complains that when they flex or extend their neck they feel an electric shock phenomenon down their back and into their limbs. What is the patient describing?,Cervical arthritis,Cervical spine stenosis,Lhermitte's sign,Malignant spinal cord compression (MSCC),Uhthoff's phenomenon,C,"Lhermitte's sign is classically associated with multiple sclerosis and suggests a lesion of the dorsal columns of the cervical cord or of the caudal medulla. Radiation myelopathy is a potential cause of this but it can also be present in many other conditions, for example vitamin B12 deficiency. If following radiotherapy it usually resolves in two to three months. Arthritis would be more gradual onset and spinal stenosis would likley have a motor component as well as being graudal also.  MSCC presents generally with weakness, cauda equina or red flag symptoms such as bowel or urinary change. There may also be a sensory level.  Uhthoff's phenomenon is the exacerbation of symptoms of MS during following overheating."
basic medicine,1543,Which of the following is the best treatment for heroin (diamorphine) overdose?,Flumazenil,Octiplex,Naloxone,Protamine,Parvolex,C,"Opioids overdose is treated using naloxone. Naloxone is short acting: this is particularly important if the patient be has respiratory depression as they may respond to treatment then relapse as the initial dose wears off.Flumazenil : used for benzodiazepine overdose. Octiplex : used for Warfarin reversal. Protamine : used for Heparin reversal. Parvolex (N-acetyl cysteine) : used for paracetamol overdose.Opioids Opioids may act at Mu, Kappa or Delta receptors.Strong opioids commonly used in clinical practice and are strong agonists of the Mu receptor.:Morphine Fentanyl MethadoneWeak opioids such are also agonists of the Mu receptor but also act as agonists at the Delta and Kappa receptors :codeine tramadol"
basic medicine,1544,What is the best initial treatment for superior vena cava obstruction (SVCO)?,CT scan of the chest,High dose dexamethasone prescription,Referral for urgent radiotherapy to the superior vena cava,Referral for urgent stenting of the superior vena cava,Therapeutic enoxaparin administration,B,"Superior vena cava obstruction is an oncological emergency.  Initial treatment with steroids will reduce the surrounding oedema and improve venous return from the head and neck, improving symptoms and providing extra time to ensure the correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment. If possible, an attempt should be made to obtain a tissue diagnosis, as some tumours respond to radiotherapy whereas others are more sensitive to chemotherapy. Tumours which are very chemosensitive, such as germ cell and lymphoma, can cause superior vena cava obstruction. Mediastinal radiotherapy leads to symptomatic relief in 80% of patients, although case studies have shown this does not always correlate to patency of the superior vena cava.  It is important to note that in 2004 NICE recommended considering stenting in the majority of cases of SVCO. This is a minimally invasive procedure which relieves symptoms quicker than chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Whilst a CT scan may be useful if determining the cause of obstruction, it has no therapeutic benefit.  Enoxparin will be of no benefit as the cause of the obstruction is extrinsic, rather than clot within the SVC itself."

basic medicine,1547,Which of the following is true regarding the anion gap?,Depends on plasma magnesium,Is decreased in diabetic ketoacidosis,Is normal with lactic acidosis,Normal value is 2-8 mmol/l,The gap is partially due to phosphate,E,"The anion gap is a method of assessing the contribution of unmeasured anions to acidosis. It is calculated as a difference between the total of sodium and potassium concentration, minus the total of chloride and bicarbonate concentration. Some people omit the potassium. Thus: Anion Gap = {K^+ + Na^+} - {Cl^− + HCO3^− } (plasma concentrations) The normal range for the anion gap is 8 to 16 mmol/L. The anion gap provides a measure of the difference between unestimated anions (phosphate, acetate and ketones) and cations. The anion gap is likely to be abnormally high in most conditions of acidosis except:  Renal tubular acidosis Treatment with acetazolamide, and Ureteric implantation into the colon.  When a metabolic acidosis is due to bicarbonate loss from gut or kidneys, the anion gap may be normal. The anion gap may be elevated when fixed or organic acids (for example, ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, uraemia, drugs) are retained."

basic medicine,1552,The following statements is true regarding heart rate in pregnancy?,Heart rate decreases by 10 beats per minute,Heart rate increases by 15 beats per minute,Heart rate remains constant,Heart rate increases by 18 beats per minute,None of the above,B,"Cardiovascular changesduring pregnancy include:increase in cardiac output can be up to 30-50% in a normal, singleton pregnancy Heart rate rises by 10-15 beats/min above baseline Blood volume slowly increases by 40-50%. Stroke volume increases by 25-30% Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases by 20-30% Diastolic blood pressure pressures decrease to a nadir during the second trimester (dropping 5–10 mm Hg below baseline), but the majority of the decrease occurs early in pregnancy (6- to 8-week gestational age) compared with preconception values. increases again to pre-pregnancy levels by 36 weeks , and this explains why cardiac problems are likely to present in early pregnancy.As most of the changes occur in the first 12 weeks of gestation cardiac problems are likely to present in early pregnancy"
basic medicine,1553,A 62-year-old female presents with deteriorating arthralgia associated with longstanding rheumatoid arthritis. She was prescribed celecoxib in place of naproxen. Which of the following concerning celecoxib is correct?,Anti-inflammatory effects of celecoxib are superior to those of naproxen ,Celecoxib acts by inhibiting a different enzyme than naproxen,Celecoxib has a lower level of anti-platelet activity than naproxen,Celecoxib is associated with reduced hepatotoxicity compared with naproxen,Co-treatment with diuretic can be given more safely than with naproxen,C,"Celecoxib is a selective cyclo-oxygenase(COX)-2 inhibitor differing from the other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as naproxen which affects both COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is involved in platelet aggregation and inhibition of this by the NSAIDs produces its beneficial cardiovascular effects. However platelet aggregation is not affected by COX-2. Naproxen and celecoxib have been shown to be as effective at reducing inflammation. One of the benefits of celecoxib is its reduced incidence of upper gastrointestinal side effects. As with the non-specific NSAIDS, hepatotoxicity may occur with the COX-2 specific inhibitors resulting in cholestatic, hepatocellular or mixed liver injury. Rates seem to be comparable between the traditional NSAIDs and the COX-2 selective inhibitors. Co-administration of diuretics and COX-2 inhibitors should be avoided if possible, as COX-2 inhibitors may reduce the antihypertensive and diuretic effects of diuretics. This may be due to impaired prostaglandin synthesis, which results in salt and water retention. In addition, COX-2 inhibitors have nephrotoxic effects which can be exacerbated by diuretics. Rofecoxib (Vioxx) has been withdrawn due to its increased cardiovascular events compared with naproxen. The cardiovascular effects of the COX-2 inhibitors remains under study, and care should be taken before prescribing them to patients with a past medical history of significant cardiovascular disease.

basic medicine,1555,A 28 year old women is seen in the early pregnancy unit. She has had a positive pregnancy test but is uncertain of her LMP. Ultrasound doesn't visualise a pregnancy. You perform bHCG tests 48 hours apart. The first bHCG is 400mIU/ml. The second is 690mIU/ml. What is the likely diagnosis,Non-Viable intrauterine pregnancy,Ectopic Pregnancy,Molar Pregnancy,Twin Pregnancy,Viable intrauterine pregnancy,E,In normal pregnancy hCG levels should rise by around 66% every 2 days. NICE advise >63% rise consistent with likely viable intrauterine pregnancy. In the example above there has been a 72% rise in 2 days - consistent with viable pregnancy. In the exam if you are asked to interpret 2 hCG results you are likely to be given either viable or non-viable pregnancy scenarios as ectopic/molars/multigestation shouldn't be diagnosed from hCG (+/- progesterone) results alone. In molar pregnancy a very high hCG is typically seen. In partial molar pregnancy the hCG typically rises at a slower rate and to a lower level than seen in normal pregnancy.In ectopic pregnancy hCG levels tend to plateau or have a doubling time of greater than 7 days (doubling time 3 days in normal pregnancy)In twin pregnancies hCG levels are typically higher than for single intrauterine pregnancy Pregnancy of Unknown Location When managing pregnancy of unknown location it is important to go on clinical symptoms primarily. hCG measurement is used to aid clinical decision making and NICE has issued guidance on when to take hCG measurements and how to interpret them.Key Points:Take 2 serum hCG measurements 48 hours apart NOT earlier Results will fall into 1 of 3 categories which are shown in the table belowhCG Result ActionDecrease in hCG>50%Pregnancy unlikely to continue.

On examination her BP is 90/50 mmHg and she has a tachycardia of 95 beats per minute. You give her hydrocortisone and an IV fluid challenge but her BP fails to improve. You decide to administer adrenalin. Which of the following is the most appropriate method of administration and dosage?",0.5 ml of 1:1000 adrenalin IM,0.5 ml of 1:10000 adrenalin IV,1 mcg/min IV adrenalin infusion,1 ml of 1:10000 adrenalin IM,4 mcg/min IV adrenalin infusion,A,"Multimodal therapy involving use of an IV corticosteroid, IV antihistamine and fluid loading is usually employed in the treatment of anaphylaxis. IV corticosteroids are designed to modulate downstream release of cytokines from inflammatory cells, they reduce the duration and severity of anaphylaxis. IV antihistamine is designed to block the effects of histamine on the vascular tree, which ameliorates hypotension, and on the airways, reducing shortness of breath and stridor. Fluid loading is designed to raise blood pressure. Adrenalin is used for its alpha-agonist effects that include increased peripheral vascular resistance and reversed peripheral vasodilatation, systemic hypotension, and vascular permeability. Beta-agonist effects include bronchodilatation, chronotropic cardiac activity, and positive inotropic effects. IM administration is preferred because of a superior safety profile with respect to cardiac adverse events compared with the IV route, although 1:10000 adrenalin IV may be used in a life-threatening situation.

basic medicine,1568,Which is true of cerebral blood flow?,Accounts for 30% of the total cardiac output,Autoregulation fails below a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mm Hg,Is controlled mainly through the autonomic system,Is increased by hypocapnia,Is increased by hypoxia,E,"The carotid arteries supply two thirds of cerebral blood flow (CBF), and the vertebral arteries one third. CBF is 15% of cardiac output. Cerebral blood volume is 10% of the intracranial space, mainly in the cerebral veins. Autoregulation maintains a constant CBF between a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 50 and 150 mm Hg. Above and below these levels, CBF has a linear relationship with MAP. These levels may be increased in patients with hypertension, so there is a greater risk of cerebral ischaemia with a 'normal' blood pressure. In brain injury, it is cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) that determines CBF. CPP is calculated as follows: MAP − (intracranial pressure [ICP] + venous pressure [VP]) Venous pressure is usually zero. With raised ICP, compensatory arterial dilatation maintains CBF until the lower autoregulatory level of 50 mm Hg is reached. It then falls. Hypercapnia increases CBF: there is a linear relationship between 2.7 kPa and 10.7 kPa. Hypoxia does not increase CBF significantly until below 6.7 kPa. Giving 100% oxygen decreases CBF by 10%. Hypothermia decreases CBF: a 10°C reduction in temperature reduces CBF by 20-50%. Hyperthermia increases CBF. "

basic medicine,1574,"A 34-year-old man with a known history of Crohn's disease was admitted to hospital with abdominal pain and features of perforation. He underwent laparotomy and a perforation of the terminal ileum was found with free faecal fluid in the abdominal cavity. He was transferred to the intensive care unit (ITU). Together with traditional antimicrobial and supportive ITU therapy, which of the following therapeutic measures is most likely to improve this patient's outcome?",High-dose intravenous corticosteroids,Low-dose intravenous corticosteroids,Recombinant anti-endotoxin antibody,Recombinant human antithrombin III,Recombinant human tissue-factor pathway inhibitor,B,"The use of corticosteroids in sepsis remains controversial. Meta-analyses of all the trials of high-dose steroids (for example, methylprednisolone 1 g) have confirmed that there is either no benefit, or even that there is an adverse effect in septic patients. However, more recent randomised controlled trials have suggested that there is a benefit in sepsis when lower physiological doses of steroids are given. The precise mechanism is not fully understood, although it is well known that septic patients have low levels of endogenous steroids.  The production of recombinant human anticoagulants has gathered pace in recent years and several products have been tested. There have been randomised clinical trials of recombinant human antithrombin III (Kyber Sept trial), activated protein C (PROWESS trial) and tissue-factor pathway inhibitor (OPTIMIST trial). Of these, only recombinant activated protein C has shown any significant survival benefit at 28 days. However, subsequent studies have failed to demonstrate a survival benefit, and have shown an increased bleeding risk. Activated protein C is therefore no longer recommended for the treatment of sepsis."
basic medicine,1575,Delivery of the fetal head from beneath the simphysis pubis,External rotation,Restitution,Internal rotation,Extension,Asynclitism,D,"Internal rotation∙ Occurs at the level of the ischial spines as a result of the combined effect of uterine contractions and thetone & shape of the pelvic floor. Typically, the head rotates 45° from the occipito-transverse to theoccipito-anterior position. This brings the suboccipito-bregmatic diameter in line with the wider diameter ofthe pelvic outlet – the antero-posterior diameterExtension∙ Following internal rotation and further descent, the base of the occiput is located at the inferior margin ofthe symphysis pubis. The tone of the pelvic floor and the downward forces from uterine contractionscause the neck to extend and the head is delivered beneath the symphysis pubis.Restitution and external rotation∙ When the fetal head is free of resistance, it untwists 45° left or right, returning to its original position inrelation to the body. This is restitution.∙ The fetal shoulders enter the pelvis with the bis-acromial diameter aligned to the transverse diameter ofthe pelvic inlet. When the shoulders reach the pelvic floor, ‘internal rotation’ also occurs to align the bis acromial diameter with the antero-posterior diameter of the pelvic outlet. This process is reflected infurther movement of the head and constitutes external rotationExpulsion∙ The anterior shoulder is then delivered under the symphysis pubis followed by the posterior shoulder"
basic medicine,1576,"On an evening ward round you glance at the blood results of a patient from another team. The results show an increased prothrombin time (PT), an increased activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT), an increased thrombin time (TT) and a low platelet count. Which of the following is the most likely underlying explanation for this set of blood results?",Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC),Haemophilia,Heparin,Liver failure,Warfarin,A,DIC is a systemic thrombo-haemorrhagic disorder with variable clinical presentation. There is activation of the coagulation process with consumption of platelets and coagulation factors with thrombin formation overwhelming the normal inhibition system and resulting in systemic fibrin deposition. Most patients present with easy bruising and haemorrhage as a pathological response to serious underlying disease. Conditions associated with DIC include  Malignancy Massive tissue injury and trauma Obstetric complications and infections.

basic medicine,1581,A 30-year-old male presented with a paranoid psychosis accompanied by visual hallucinations which resolved over the next three days. Which one of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Alcohol withdrawal,Diazepam dependence,Fluoxetine overdose,Heroin withdrawal,Smoking cannabis,A,"The key points in the history are that, firstly, these are visual hallucinations and secondly that they resolve over 72 hours. Of all the options given, alcohol withdrawal is the most likely. The fact that this patient has paranoid psychosis makes it even more likely. Symptoms typically present about 8 hours after a significant fall in blood alcohol levels. The peak is on day two, and by day five the symptoms are significantly better. Minor withdrawal symptoms appear 6-12 hours after cessation of alcohol and include:  Insomnia Fatigue Tremor Anxiety Nausea Vomiting Headache Sweating Palpitations Anorexia Depression, and Craving.  Alcoholic hallucinosis can appear 12-24 hours after stopping alcohol and includes visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations. Withdrawal seizures can appear 24-28 hours after cessation and are generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Alcohol withdrawal delirium ('delerium tremens') can appear 48-72 hours after cessation. Mortality without treatment is approximately 35%. Benzodiazepines can cause a protracted withdrawal syndrome, with symptoms persisting for 6 months or more. It is characterised by anxiety, irritability, insomnia and sensory disturbance. In severe cases it can resemble mania and schizophrenia. Fluoxetine overdose typically causes few symptoms, but can be associated with arrhthymias. Heroin withdrawal has significant physical symptoms, including tremors, cramps, muscle and bone pain, rhinitis, tachycardia and diarrhoea and vomiting, in addition to psychiatric symptoms. Cannabis use causes relaxation, euphoria, short-term memory loss and dry mouth and eyes. A withdrawal syndrome is recognised but not well defined. Long-term use has been linked with paranoia and schizophrenia, but these symptoms do not resolve quickly and visual hallucinations are unlikely. "

basic medicine,1590,Gentamicin (7 mg/kg once daily) is administered to an elderly patient with severe urosepsis. Twenty‐four hours post‐administration gentamicin levels are more than 2 mg/L. Which of the following complications is this patient at most risk of?,Retinopathy,Encephalopathy,Peripheral neuropathy,Hepatotoxicity,Nephrotoxicity,E,"Prolonged exposure to gentamicin is likely to cause nephrotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients with renal impairment. This is more likely to develop if gentamicin accumulates over a course of treatment, and is usually due to acute tubular necrosis. It is therefore important to dose gentamicin according to body weight, and monitor levels, the frequency of which depends on which dosing schedule is being used. Extra caution is needed in elderly patients who are at a very high risk of acute renal failure.In this situation the next dose of gentamicin should not be given if the gentamicin trough exceeds 2 mg/L.Gentamicin is also a vestibulotoxin, which can result in permanent loss of equilibrioception. This usually develops if gentamicin is taken at high doses for prolonged periods, although there are case reports where this developed within three to five days. This side effect can be used for therapeutic benefit in severe Meniere's disease.Hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy and retinopathy are not classically associated with gentamicin."

basic medicine,1599,Which of the following is true regarding the vermiform appendix?,Averages 5 cm in length,Embryologically elongates as rapidly as the rest of the colon,Is supplied by branches of the inferior mesenteric artery,Longitudinal layer is a continuation of the taeniae coli,Tip is at a constant location,D,"The appendix forms a wormlike (vermiform) structure as it does not elongate as rapidly as the rest of the colon. The average length is 10 cm (range from 2-20 cm). The wall of the appendix consists of two layers of muscle, an inner circular and outer longitudinal. The longitudinal layer is a continuation of the taeniae coli. The appendix is lined by colonic epithelium. Few submucosal lymphoid follicles are noted at birth. These follicles enlarge, peak from 12-20 years, and then decrease. This correlates with the incidence of appendicitis. Blood supply to the appendix is mainly from the appendicular artery, a branch of the ileocolic artery. This artery courses through the mesoappendix posterior to the terminal ileum. The base of the appendix is fairly constant and is located at the posteromedial wall of the caecum about 2.5 cm below the ileocaecal valve. This is also where the taeniae converge. The base is at a constant location, whereas the position of the tip of the appendix varies. In 65% of patients, the tip is located in a retrocaecal position; in 30%, it is located at the brim or in the true pelvis; and, in 5%, it is extraperitoneal, situated behind the caecum, ascending colon, or distal ileum. The location of the tip of the appendix determines early signs and symptoms. "

basic medicine,1604,A 64-year-old woman presented 10 hours after ingestion of 12 g of quinine sulphate. Which of the following is the most common characteristic clinical feature in this situation?,Blindness,Bradycardia,Hyperacusis,Hyperglycaemia,Hypotension,A,"The major toxic effects of quinine are on the nervous system, in particular the optic and auditory nerve. It is also particularly toxic on retinal photoreceptor cells, and causes vasoconstriction and spasm of the retinal artery. Blurred vision can proceed to complete blindness, which is characteristic of overdose. Initial signs are narrowing of the retinal arterioles on fundoscopy. Later there is retinal oedema, and the pupils become dilated and unresponsive to light. Effects on the auditory nerve may cause tinnitus and deafness, but not hyperacusis. Initially quinine causes generalised stimulation of the central nervous system, leading to tachycardia, fever, delirium and tachypnoea. In severe overdose it can then cause myocardial depression, peripheral vasodiltation and widened QRS with prolonged QTc and risk of VT, torsade and VF. In addition, renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and gastrointestinal disturbance can develop. At very high plasma levels, sinoatrial block and high-degree atrioventricular block may be seen. Hypotension may occur secondary to quinine's alpha-blocking effect, but is not as characteristic as blindness. Additional features include:  nausea vomiting headache seizures fatigue tremor, and ataxia.  Hyperglycaemia is not characteristic. Management is with activated charcoal and gastric lavage, if presentation is early enough. Bradycardia can be treated with atropine or pacing. Bicarbonate is considered for a prolonged QRS (greater than120 ms), aiming for a pH of 7.45-5. Haemodialysis can also be used to clear the quinine. There is no specific treatment for visual disturbance."

Thisfibroblasts build new extracellular matrix. Re-epithelialisation also occurs. Wound Healing Wound healing is typically divided into four phases. The four phases of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase: This is the initial phase that starts immediately after the injury occurs. The body's response involves vasoconstriction and the formation of a blood clot .Inflammatory Phase: Following hemostasis, the inflammatory phase begins and can last for several days. During this phase, the body triggers an inflammatory response to remove debris, foreign substances, and bacteria from the wound. Immune cells, growth factors, and other chemicals are released to initiate the healing process.Proliferative Phase: After the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase starts, lasting for several weeks. New tissue is formed through the action of fibroblasts, which produce collagen, and other cells. The wound is filled with granulation tissue, which contains new blood vessels and collagen.Remodeling Phase: The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase. It can last for several months to years after the injury. During this phase, the collagen fibers reorganize and gain strength, and the wound contracts and becomes smaller. The goal is to improve the wound's tensile strength and functionality, although it may not reach the original strength of the uninjured tissue entirely."

Which of the following best describes the action of cisplatin?,DNA cross-linking,DNA antimetabolites,Inhibition of protein synthesis,Alkylating agent,Topoisomerase inhibitor,A,"Cisplatin enters cells and undergoes chemical reaction in which the chloride ligands are replaced by water molecules, resulting in the formation of positively charge platinum complexes. These react with nucleophilic sites on DNA, and covalently bind resulting in intra-strand and inter-strand cross-links. These cisplatin-DNA adducts prevent DNA, RNA and protein synthesis. Because its action is similar to the bifunctional alkylating agents, it is sometimes grouped as an alkylating agent but this does not describe its mode of action."
basic medicine,1617,"In red blood cells, which of the following is correct?",Carbon dioxide binds with reduced haemoglobin,Carbonic anhydrase is absent,Most carbon dioxide in venous blood is transported bound to albumin,Oxygen affinity of fetal haemoglobin is less than adult haemoglobin,Oxygen affinity of haemoglobin is increased in the presence of acidosis,A,"Carbon dioxide is carried in the blood in three forms:  Dissolved (10%) Bicarbonate, the formation of which is encouraged by carbonic anhydrase present in the red cell As carbamino compounds: hydrogen ions liberated from the bicarbonate reaction are bound to haemoglobin which encourages the release of oxygen, since reduced haemoglobin is less acid than the oxygenated forms.  Thus the presence of reduced haemoglobin in the peripheral blood helps with the loading of carbon dioxide, while the oxygenation which occurs in the pulmonary capillary assists in its unloading. The fact that the deoxygenation of the blood increases its ability to carry carbon dioxide is often known as the Haldane effect. Fetal haemoglobin contains g-polypeptide chains in place of the b-chains of Hb A. Its resistance to denaturation by strong alkali is used in its quantitations. Hb F is the predominant haemoglobin from eight weeks gestation, and constitutes 90% of the total haemoglobin of the 6 month fetus. At birth 70% of the total is Hb F, and synthesis decreases rapidly postnatally, such that by a year only 2% is present. Hb F has a greater oxygen affinity than Hb A, so the growing fetus is preferentially nourished by oxygen in utero."

basic medicine,1631,"A 67-year-old man is reviewed in oncology following surgery to remove a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). He had been losing weight over the past few months, suffering from night sweats, nausea, and early satiety, and an endoscopy had identified the tumour. A decision is made to commence adjuvant imatinib therapy. Which of the following represents the mode of action of imatinib?",Alkylating agent,Nucleoside analogue,mTOR inhibitor,Serine threonine kinase inhibitor,Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,E,"The answer is Tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Imatinib is a small molecule protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits the activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK), as well the KIT and PDGFR receptors. It was primarily developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia, although now it has also proved useful in the treatment of a range of other myeloproliferative disorders including gastrointestinal stromal tumours. Studies suggest that in high risk patients it may reduce rate of recurrence after surgery. Examples of alkylating agents include chlorambucil and cyclophosphamide, used as part of conventional chemotherapy regimens but not classically in the treatment of GISTs. Nucleoside analogues interfere with DNA replication and are primarily used as anti-virals including in the treatment of HIV, Hepatitis B and C. mTOR inhibitors are also used in the treatment of cancer, an example is everolimus, which is most commonly used in combination with exemestane for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. A number of serine threonine kinase inhibitors are currently in development for the treatment of various malignancies. Further reading"
basic medicine,1632,Which of the following is true regarding cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)?,Blockage of the arachnoid granulation causes non-communicating hydrocephalus,Is absorbed mainly through the arachnoid granulations in the inferior sagittal sinus,Is produced by the modified ependymal cells of the choroid plexus,The arachnoid granulation is in contact with the media of the venous sinuses,The ventricular system communicates with the subarachnoid space through the roof of the third ventricle,C,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced by the choroid plexuses within the lateral, third, and fourth ventricles of the brain. Aggregates of arachnoid villi (arachnoid granulations) serve as sites where the CSF diffuses into the bloodstream. CSF leaves the ventricular system of the brain and enters the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia mater, where it cushions and nourishes the brain. In certain areas the arachnoid projects into the venous sinuses to form arachnoid villi and is in contact with the venous endothelium. Hydrocephalus occurs when there is obstruction (communicating hydrocephalus) to the outflow of CSF, which can occur if there is blockage of the arachnoid granulations."
basic medicine,1633,"You see a 26‐year‐lady who is 34 weeks pregnant in her first pregnancy. She has been sent in for review as her blood pressure was raised at a routine check. Monitoring on the assessment ward has shown persistently raised blood pressure, with 1+ proteinuria and normal bloods. You decide to start treatment with labetalol.

Hypotension is a late and often sudden sign of decompensation, and if not reversed will be rapidly followed by death. A formula for calculating normal systolic blood pressure is 80 + (2 × age in years). Capillary refill time is a more useful test of perfusion in children than blood pressure measurement. The skin on the sternum or a digit held at the level of the heart should be pressed for five seconds. After blanching pressure has been released the time for the colour to return to normal is measured. A normal capillary refill time is less than two seconds. Hypoglycaemia and shock may co-exist as the sick child or infant has poor glucose producing reserves. Urgent blood glucose estimation must always be performed to exclude this common condition. Fluid resuscitation in paediatric shock is based on crystalloid boluses of 20 ml/kg, which can be repeated up to three times. Blood is the colloid of choice, although 4.5% albumin may have a role in septicaemia."

basic medicine,1650,Which one of the following wounds should be closed primarily?,A skin laceration 12 hours old,Gunshot wound to the abdomen,Hartmann's procedure performed for faecal peritonitis,Open cholecystectomy performed for mucocele of the gallbladder,Shocked patient,D,"A skin laceration 12-24 hours old should be left open and packed, the wound should be inspected at seven days and if clean should be closed. With severe soiling there is a very high chance of a superficial wound dehiscence, therefore the rectus should be sutured and the skin left opened, the wound should be inspected daily and if clean closed at seven days. A shocked patient is unable to perfuse tissue therefore there is a high chance of skin edge necrosis, therefore the wound should be treated as above. A high velocity injury causes cavitation within the abdomen drawing in debris. The wounds should be treated as above. Cholecystectomy for a mucocele is usually a clean operation and is therefore safe to close."

In the pelvis it runs on piriformis and then passes laterally through the greater sciatic foramen (foramen infra-piriformis) to enter the gluteal region. Here it lies inferior to piriformis as does the sciatic nerve, the inferior gluteal neurovascular bundle and the nerve to quadratus femoris. The pudendal nerve curls around the spine of the ischium lying superficial to the sacrospinous ligament and then passes into the lessor sciatic foramen to enter the ischiorectal fossa. The pudendal nerve, artery and vein and nerve to obturator internus cross the ischial spine as they leave the pelvis via the greater sciatic foramen and enter the lesser sciatic foramen. The pudendal nerve and vessels enter the perineum via the pudendal canal. The nerve to obturator internus is the most lateral of these structures, the pudendal nerve the most medial. The inferior rectal nerve is the first branch of the pudendal nerve and along with the second branch, the perineal nerve, arises from the pudendal nerve in the pudendal canal (Alcock's canal).

basic medicine,1658,Which of the following is correct regarding cerebral blood flow?,Accounts for 40% of the total cardiac output,Is controlled mainly through the autonomic system,Is decreased if isoflurane is used during general anaesthesia,Is increased by hypocapnia,Is increased by hypoxia,E,"In humans, the cerebral circulation is endowed with complex regulatory mechanisms to ensure a continuous and adequate blood (and oxygen) supply to the brain. Cerebral blood flow accounts for about 15% of cardiac output. In normal circumstances, one of the most powerful regulators of cerebral blood flow is the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO2), and to a lesser extent, the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2), in the arterial blood. Cerebral blood flow and cerebral blood volume are not affected by concentrations of 0.6-1.1 MAC isoflurane, but 1.6 MAC doubles cerebral blood flow."
basic medicine,1659,"In the regulation of arterial blood pressure and cardiac output (CO), which is correct?",Coronary blood flow (CBF) varies with the cardiac output,Decrease in the force of ventricular contraction is one effect of an increase in sympathetic activity,"During muscular exercise, the total peripheral resistance is unchanged","If cardiac output decreases, the arterial pressure will invariably be decreased",The main factor causing the increase in blood flow to exercising muscles is an increase in arterial blood pressure,A,"There is close regulation of arterial peripheral resistance {PR} and cardiac output {CO} for the preservation of blood pressure. It is determined through the equation of BP = CO × PR. With a decrease in CO, BP need not necessarily be decreased if the heart rate (HR) or peripheral resistance (PR) increases. With increased HR and BP in exercise, TPR may fall. Adrenergic stimulation produces increased force of ventricular contraction. There is a variation of CBF with HR and CO particularly as CBF occurs during diastole, hence increased HR with reduced diastolic time reduces coronary diastolic filling."
basic medicine,1660,Which of the following is an acute complication of radiotherapy?,Lymphoedema,Fibrosis,Acute myeloid leukaemia,Moist skin desquamation,Epilation,D,"Side effects vary significantly from site to site. Some side effects such as dry mouth may be acute or late. Moist skin desquamation is an acute side effect of radiotherapy. Epilation is more likely to occur in fields targeted by radiotherapy with cumulative dose of 45 Gy. Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS )can develop years after radiotherapy. It is thought about 10% of MDS are secondary, most often due to radiotherapy or chemotherapy for cancer. Some MDS remain indolent whilst others transform to aggressive forms such as AML.Fibrosis and lymphoedema are other late complications Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Key PointsIonizing radiation Causes DNA damage leading to cellular death DNA damage caused by ionisation leading to free radical formation Can be locally placed i.e Brachythrapy or external beam To reduce damage to normal tissue shaped and multiple beams are used with a higher absorbed dose at the point of convergence Radiosensitizers increase the effect of a given dose of radiation Radiosensitisers fall into 4 main groups:1. Oxygen2. Hypoxic cell sensitizers3. Halogenated Pyrimidines4. Bioreductive AgentsRadioprotectors are agents that reduce the effects of radiation. Their role is limited in clinical practice due to possible protection of tumours Radiotherapy dosing is in Gray (Gy). Total dose varies between tumour type and stage but typical regimes involve 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions delivered over a number of weeks with total dose accumulating to reach around 50 Gy (a comprehensive list can be found using the link on the right but is likely beyond the scope of the MRCOG exam)"
basic medicine,1661,"Regarding management of chronic wounds, which of the following is correct?",Alginate dressings should be used for dry and granulating wounds,Hydrogel dressings may provide autolytic debridement,Iodine based dressings are effective in the management of heavily exuding wounds,Occlusive dressings are useful in infected wounds,Sharp debridement inhibits healing in chronic wounds,B,"There are many types of dressings and very little reliable experimental evidence to support any of them. The British National Formulary devotes an entire appendix to wound management products. Hydrogels (GranuGel, Intrasite Gel, Intrasite Conformable) retain moisture or provide hydration and are thus useful in dry, necrotic wounds. They facilitate autolytic debridement of necrotic tissues. Amorphous hydrogels (hydrocolloids) (Duoderm; Granuflex) absorb moisture so are more suitable for sloughy wounds. Alginate dressings such as Kaltostat, Sorbsan, and Urgosorb are highly absorbent, have haemostatic properties and are useful in packing cavities. Since they absorb moisture they are not useful in dry or granulating wounds. Occlusive dressings should be avoided in infected wounds as they can worsen the infection by retaining the exudate and causing maceration of the surrounding skin. Iodine-based dressings are not particularly effective in the management of exuding wounds although they are useful in infected ulcers, particularly diabetic foot ulcers. Sharp debridement, either with a curette or a scalpel, is useful in stimulating healing of inert and static ulcers. Sharp debridement removes excess exudate, necrotic material, bacterial colonies and other foreign bodies which are detrimental to healing, besides stimulating an acute wound healing response."

basic medicine,1668,Which of the following is true of endotoxins?,They are found in the vesicle of bacterial cytoplasm,They are involved in botulism,They are produced mainly by Gram positive bacteria,They can often survive autoclaving,They elicit an antibody response which may protect the host from future attack,D,"Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides derived from the cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria They are heat stable. They may require dry heat sterilization at 250^oC for 30 minutes. They can be denatured by soft endothermal processing (140^oC for 30 minutes). Endotoxins are antigenic but the response is often directed against the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) component of the cell wall so this is not as effective as antibodies to exotoxins. They are only partly neutralised by specific antibodies. Future repeat infection may still take place. They cause septicaemia and fever, and activate the alternative complement pathway."

This single artery (not paired) then supplies the pia mater and anterior two thirds of the spinal cord, including the anterior and lateral columns (major motor tracts). It anastomoses with the posterior artery over the conus medullaris. The posterior spinal arteries arise from the vertebral arteries, which pass down the spinal cord but they do not unite. They supply the posterior one third of the spinal cord (including the major sensory tracts). The blood supplied by the anterior and posterior spinal arteries is augmented by collateral radicular arteries, the most important being the branches of the posterior intercostal arteries at the sites of the cervical and lumbar cord enlargements. The artery of Adamkiewicz (greater radicular artery) supplies blood to the anterior spinal artery and distal cord. It usually arises from an intercostal branch between T8 and T12."

The umbilical artery in turn gives off one or more superior vesical arteries to the bladder. Beyond this point the umbilical artery is obliterated and continues to the umbilicus as the medial umbilical ligament. The internal pudendal artery terminates in branches which supply the perineal and vulval structures, including the erectile tissue of the vestibular bulb and clitoris."

basic medicine,1746,Which of the following is correct regarding the levator ani muscles?,Are contracted during defecation,Are involuntary muscles,Are relaxed during micturition,"Form a floor which slopes downwards, laterally and backwards",It is a single muscle,C,"The levator ani consists of a pair of broad, flat muscle, the fibres of which pass downwards and inwards. Together with its fellow on the opposite side, the two muscles constitute the pelvic diaphragm. The periurethral levator ani is under voluntary control and actively contracts during abdominal straining. As soon as the bladder fills to its functional capacity a signal from within the detrusor muscle receptors is sent to higher cortical centers in the brain to initiate the emptying phase. Normal voiding occurs when urethral muscles relax before the detrusor muscle contracts. The voiding process begins with the inhibition of both sympathetic relaxation of the detrusor muscle and of sympathetic contraction of the proximal urethral sphincter. This is followed by the inhibition of the pudendal and sacral efferent nerves, resulting in the relaxation of the external urethral sphincter and levator ani muscles. Finally, parasympathetic stimulation via the interaction of released acetylcholine and cholinergic receptors causes the detrusor muscle to contract, emptying bladder contents. Rectal distention stimulates internal anal sphincter relaxation and the sampling reflex. If defecation is to be deferred voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter and levator ani muscles occurs. Accommodation refers to the relaxation of the rectal ampulla after an initial increase in pressure. At the appropriate time for defecation or when rectal pressure is high, the levator ani muscle, puborectalis muscle and external anal sphincter relax. Pelvic floor relaxation, along with a squatting position, straightens the anorectal angle. An increase in abdominal pressure along with colonic and rectal contractions allows expulsion of a fecal bolus. levatori ani is not in fact a single, but a collection of three muscles: puborectalis, pubococcygeus, and iliococcygeus.

basic medicine,1749,A previously fit 47-year-old man presents with lower back pain which is shown to be a consequence of vertebral collapse due to osteoporosis. Which of the following would be the most appropriate investigation for this patient?,Oestrogen concentration,Prolactin concentration,Prostate-specific antigen concentration,Testosterone concentration,Thyroid function tests,D,Osteoporosis in a young man would be unusual. Any symptoms or features of hypogonadism or hypercalcaemia should be elicited. Hyperprolactinaemia causes hypogonadism so a testosterone concentration would be far more relevant. Hyperthryoidism would need to be present for a considerable length of time before producing osteoporosis. Hypogonadism often goes unnoticed. Prostate malignancy does not cause osteoporosis.
basic medicine,1750,Which of the following is likely to reduce the effectiveness of local radiotherapy?,Hypoxic environment,Metronidazole treatment,Cetumixab therapy,Cisplatin chemotherapy,Polycythaemia,A,"As oxygen is a radiosensitiser it follows that hypoxic environments are more resistant to radiation damage. Factors that exacerbate hypoxia such as anaemia may also reduce the effectiveness of radiotherapy.Metronidazole, cisplatin and cetumixab are all radio sensitisers. You are unlikely to be asked about drugs that are radioprotective. Amifostine is approved but its clinical use is limited. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Key PointsIonizing radiation Causes DNA damage leading to cellular death DNA damage caused by ionisation leading to free radical formation Can be locally placed i.e Brachythrapy or external beam To reduce damage to normal tissue shaped and multiple beams are used with a higher absorbed dose at the point of convergence Radiosensitizers increase the effect of a given dose of radiation Radiosensitisers fall into 4 main groups:1. Oxygen2. Hypoxic cell sensitizers3. Halogenated Pyrimidines4. Bioreductive AgentsRadioprotectors are agents that reduce the effects of radiation. Their role is limited in clinical practice due to possible protection of tumours Radiotherapy dosing is in Gray (Gy). Total dose varies between tumour type and stage but typical regimes involve 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions delivered over a number of weeks with total dose accumulating to reach around 50 Gy (a comprehensive list can be found using the link on the right but is likely beyond the scope of the MRCOG exam)"

basic medicine,1753,Which of the following is true of the physics of ultrasound?,A thicker piezoelectric crystal has a higher resonance frequency,A thicker piezoelectric crystal has a shorter wavelength,Acoustic velocity determines beam reflection,As the angle of incidence increases more sound is reflected,The acoustic impedance of a material is the product of its density and the velocity of sound within it,E,"The physics of ultrasound appear quite commonly in the examination. Acoustic Impedance is a product of the density of a material and the speed of sound in that material. Acoustic impedance mismatch determines beam reflection. A very high impedance mismatch (for example, muscle/bone or fluid/air) results in very high reflection and very little transmission. Refraction is the bending of a wave beam when it crosses at an oblique angle the interface of two materials, through which the waves propagate at different velocities."

basic medicine,1755,When considering the pathophysiological response to severe head injury (HI) which of the following is true?,A linear vault fracture increases the chance of intracranial haematoma by a factor of 10,Autoregulation of cerebral blood flow in compensation for an expanding mass is described by the Monro-Kellie doctrine,Cerebral perfusion pressure is the mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) minus intracranial pressure,In a severe head injury cerebral blood flow autoregulation often remains normal,Normal cerebral blood flow is approximately 80 ml/100 g of brain/minute,C,"The cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is defined as mean arterial BP (MAP) minus intracranial pressure. A perfusion pressure of less than 70 mmHg is associated with a poor outcome. Normal cerebral blood flow (CBF) is less than 50 ml/100 g of brain per min. Less than 25 ml/100 g/min sees a reduction in EEG activity, and at approximately 5 ml/100 g/min leads to cell death and irreversible damage. CBF auto regulation is normally markedly disturbed in a patient with a severe head injury. This makes management of a rising ICP harder. These patients are very susceptible to secondary brain injury from hypotension and hypoxia. The Monro-Kellie doctrine states that the skull is a rigid, non-expansile box and therefore the total volume of the intracranial content must remain constant. The addition of an intracranial mass (haematoma) means that one of the other components must be reduced to keep the volume constant. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and venous blood are squeezed out. Eventually this reaches a critical point when no further compensation is possible, hence a rise in intracranial pressure (ICP). A linear vault fracture of the skull increases the risk of intracranial haematoma by approximately 400 times. "
basic medicine,1756,A mother develops her 1st episode of genital herpes 4 weeks prior to delivery. Following delivery her baby develops disseminated neonatal herpes. What is the mortality rate associated with disseminated neonatal herpes assuming appropriate antiviral treatment is given?,5%,10%,30%,50%,80%,C,"The mortality rate is 30% with treated disseminated neonatal herpes Herpes Simplex Herpes Simplex (HSV) in Pregnancy Key PointsTypes 1 and 2 (type 2 accounts for 70% of genital herpes infections) Double stranded DNA virus HSV infection may be transmitted to neonates.

basic medicine,1757,"A 42-year-old woman was taking an antibiotic for a urinary tract infection when she suffered a left Achilles tendon rupture whilst playing badminton. She is very fit, exercising and doing stretching work up to four times per week, and feels the antibiotic may have been responsible. Which of the following antibiotics is the most likely cause?",Amoxicillin,Cephalexin,Co-amoxiclav,Ofloxacin,Trimethoprim,D,"The whole class of quinolone antibiotics is associated with case reports of tendon rupture. This may in part be related to decreased cellular proliferation and tendon fibroblast turnover. In animal models where quinolones are continued post tendon rupture, it is associated with delayed healing. Juvenile toxicity models also show increased rates of tendon abnormalities, and for this reason use of quinolones is not recommended in children or in pregnancy."

After the 10th week the yolk sac will gradually disappear. It is usually sonographically undetectable by 20 weeks. The yolk sac is usually seen on TVS when gestational sac diameter reaches 8-10mm (approx 5.5 wks) and should be visible in all pregnancies when gestational sac measures over 12mm. The yolk sac is seen on transabdominal ultrasound when the gestational sac diameter reaches 20 mm (approx 7 wks) A yolk sac greater than 6mm diameter is suspicious of failed pregnancy. The embryonic pole becomes visible on transvaginal ultrasound at around 5 and a half to 6 weeks gestation when it measures around 3mm. The yolk sac and embryonic pole are typically visible on TVS when they reach 3mm in size. Once the gestational sac diameter is greater than or equal to 16mm the embryonic pole should become visible.Pregnancy failure is not diagnosed until a fetal pole is not seen when mean sac diameter reaches 25 mm on TVS (and this should be confirmed by a second scan according to NICE guidance) The gestational sac is typically visible from 31 days gestation by transvaginal ultrasound and a week later (38 days) on transabdominal ultrasound.
basic medicine,1765,"A 71-year-old man with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes and erectile dysfunction comes to the clinic for review complaining of blue vision. He takes amlodipine and ramipril for hypertension, digoxin for atrial fibrillation, sitagliptin and metformin for diabetes, and sildenafil for erectile dysfunction. Which of the following is most likely to be responsible for his blue vision?",Amlodipine,Digoxin,Metformin,Sildenafil,Sitagliptin,D,"Digoxin is associated with yellow/green visual disturbance. Sildenafil is a PDE-5 inhibitor, but at high dose it inhibits the activity of PDE-6, which is essential for the functioning of retinal rods cells. Inhibition of the enzyme leads to patients reporting blue tinged vision, particularly in low light conditions. The condition may be improved by reducing the dose of sildenafil, but of course this may limit efficacy with respect to improving erectile dysfunction. The other 3 medications have no common reports fo visual colour change as a side effect."

She undergoes a renal biopsy and is diagnosed as having minimal change nephropathy. She is readmitted with a painful left leg and further significant oedema. A deep vein thrombosis extending to her external iliac vein is diagnosed on Doppler ultrasound. She is commenced on heparin but symptoms fail to respond.  Her clotting studies show an APTT ratio of 1.86 and INR of 1.5. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Anti-phospholipid syndrome,Antithrombin-III deficiency,Dehydration ,Hodgkin's disease,Inadequate heparin,B,"ATIII deficiency is likely, as nephrotics often lose antithrombin in the urine. Hodgkin's disease can cause minimal change disease, but there is nothing in the history to suggest this. She has no postural drop, so dehydration is unlikely in the presence of oedema. Anti-phospholipid syndrome does not cause minimal change nephropathy."

basic medicine,1771,The mechanism of transfer of carbon dioxide across the placenta,Simple diffusion,Active transport,Bulk transfer,Facilitated diffusion,Secondary active transport,A,"CARBOHYDRATES & AMINO ACIDS• Glucose transport across the microvillous and basal plasma membranes is by facilitated diffusion.• This is dependent on glucose concentration gradient and the activity of transport proteins within the placenta. Intheory, facilitated diffusion can be saturated.• In practice, the glucose transfer capacity (especially of the microvillous plasma membrane) is so large that it wouldnot approach saturation under in-vivo conditions• Fetal amino acid concentrations are generally higher than maternal levels• Transfer of amino acids from the mother to the fetus is therefore against a concentration gradient and energy (ATP) isrequired for this process• This energy is provided by coupling the transfer of amino acids (up a concentration gradient) to the transfer of sodiumions (down a concentration gradient) - secondary active transport. These are called Na+-dependent transporters. Thesodium concentration gradient is maintained by Na+K+ATPase.• Other amino acid transport systems are, however, Na+-independent."
basic medicine,1772,"A 74-year-old woman with chronic renal failure is admitted to the unit with infective endocarditis. You elect to begin treatment with IV benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. On examination her temperature is 38.2°C, and she has a pansystolic murmur loudest at the left sternal edge, her BP is 125/82 mmHg, her pulse is 80 bpm and regular and she weighs 80 kg.

Aminoglycosides, such as gentamicin, have limited tissue distribution and are renally cleared. High plasma concentrations can cause oto and nephrotoxicity, and dosing therefore needs to be carefully planned and monitored. Where gentamicin is concerned both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity are potential concerns. There are two commonly used regimens for dosing gentamicin. Both require the patient's body weight to ensure accurate dosing. For patients who are over their ideal body weight, this value rather than the patient's actual weight should be used. Ideal body weight can be calculated using age, sex and height on a number of online applications. The most commonly used dosing regimen in the UK is the once daily regime, which is thought to be associated with reduced toxicity whilst being effective against gram-negative infections. It is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance of less than 60 ml/min. The dose used is 7 mg/kg IV every 24 hours. Levels should be monitored for patients on this regimen for 3 days or more, with a level taken 6-14 hours following the third dose. A nomogram is then used to determine whether the interval between doses should be altered. Patients with creatinine clearance of less than 60 ml/min are usually given a reduced dose of gentamicin with a multiple-daily dosing regimen. This may also be recommended by microbiologists for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections such as Pseudomonas. Dosing is dependent on creatinine clearance:  greater than60 ml/min - 1.5-1.7 mg/kg IV every 8 hours 40-60 ml/min - 1.2-1.5 mg/kg IV every 12 hours 20-40 ml/min - 1.2-1.5 mg/kg IV every 12-24 hours less than20 ml/min - 2 mg/kg loading dose then discuss with microbiology and pharmacy  On this regimen monitoring is typically initiated after the 3rd or 4th dose, which allows a steady-state to be reached. Peak levels should be taken 30 minutes following the end of the infusion, and a trough level taken before the next dose. The desired trough level is less than 2 micrograms/ml, with a peak level of 5-8 micrograms/ml. In this case, this lady has a creatinine clearance of 29 ml/min. As such the 7 mg/kg regimen is not appropriate. She should receive 1.2-1.5 mg/kg every 12-24 hours, so 1.5 mg/kg OD is the most correct here. Three other drugs which require therapeutic monitoring are phenytoin, warfarin and clozapine. Phenytoin is a highly effective anti-epileptic but is associated at toxic levels with neurological dysfunction including dizziness and nystagmus. Most warfarin therapy is directed towards a narrow therapeutic window between an INR of 2-3. Ineffective anticoagulation and excess coagulation can both be associated with significant adverse effects. Clozapine is effective in the treatment of psychotic disorders but is associated with blood cell dyscrasias, for this reason regular monitoring of full blood count is recommended. Whereas monitoring of gentamicin and phenytoin involves PK monitoring (measuring the level of the drug in plasma), monitoring of warfarin and clozapine is essentially pharmacodynamic monitoring, looking for either over anticoagulation or abnormalities in the white blood cell count.

basic medicine,1773,A patient is suspected of ingesting ethylene glycol. She is found to be acidotic and hypocalcaemic. She is given fomepizole. What is its mechanism of action?,Inhibitor of ethylene glycol,Competitive inhibition of alcohol dehydrogenase,Increases metabolism of ethylene glycol,Restores glutathione store,Chelates toxic metabolites,B,When ethylene glycol is ingested it is metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase into glycolic acid leading to acidosis and hyperventilation. It is further metabolised into other toxic metabolites including oxalate which can lead to urinary oxalate crystals. Hypocalcaemia can occur. Fomepizole is a competitive inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase and therefore ethylene glycol is not metabolised to its toxic form.
basic medicine,1774,Which of the following is included in the herpes group of viruses?,Cystovirus,Epstein-Barr virus (EBV),Papilloma virus,Rabies virus,Rotavirus,B,"The Herpesviridae family of viruses are dsDNA viruses that include herpes simplex, Varicella zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV.

The aortic arch reaches to just below the level of the sternal notch. The tracheal carina is at the level of the manubrial-sternal joint. The level of the suprasternal notch is at the lower body of T2.
basic medicine,1776,Which of the following is true at birth?,Pulmonary vascular resistance rises,Systemic vascular resistance falls,The cardiac output averages 5 litres per minute,The opening between the two ventricles closes,There is a reversal of flow in the ductus arteriosus,E,"When the umbilical cord is clamped, the umbilical vein closes, systemic vascular resistance is increased and this causes the ductus venosus to close. At birth the lungs are aerated, acutely lowering the pulmonary vascular resistance. The ductus arteriosus constricts in a response to the rising oxygen tension, thus preventing the blood from the aorta and pulmonary artery from mixing. The first stage of closure happens o the first 15 hours after birth. Complete closure may take about 2 weeks. There is reversed flow as the systemic circulation now has a higher pressure than the pulmonary circulation. There is no opening between the two ventricles. The foramen ovale is the anatomical opening between the right atrium and left atrium that closes shortly after birth. The cardiac output for an adult is 5 litres a minute."

In the other conditions listed the diffusion capacity is elevated. In emphysema, pulmonary vascular disease and anaemia, the diffusion capacity is reduced but the alveolar volume is increased."
basic medicine,1779,Which of the following is true of the diaphragm?,Develops from the septum transversum and cervical myotomes,Receives only a nerve supply from the phrenic nerves,Transmits the aorta at the level of the T8 vertebra,Transmits the inferior vena cava at the level of the T12 vertebra,Transmits the left phrenic nerve via an opening in the central tendon,A,"The diaphragm is a domed fibro-muscular sheet separating the thorax from the abdomen. It develops mainly from septum transversum (central tendon) and cervical myotomes (muscular component). The mesothelial linings are derived from the pleuro-peritoneal membranes (failure of its development leads to Bochdalek's foramen and hernia). Oesophageal mesentery also contributes to the formation of the diaphragm. Morgagni's foramen is a congenital defect arising at the junction of the costal and xiphoid origins. Because of its cervical myotomal origin, it receives nerve supply from cervical roots; the phrenic nerves. The phrenic nerves pierce the muscular components not the central tendon to reach and supply the diaphragm from below. The lower intercostal nerves give only proprioceptive supply to the periphery of the diaphragm. The openings in diaphragm are:  Aortic opening - T12 Oesophageal opening - T10 Vena caval opening - T8."

basic medicine,1782,A 69-year-old smoker is to undergo a left femoro-popliteal bypass for critical ischaemia. He is not allergic to penicillin and his renal function is normal. Which of the following would be regarded as appropriate antibacterial prophylaxis for this patient?,Co-amoxiclav,Erythromycin,Flucloxacillin,Gentamicin,Metronidazole,A,"Appropriate prophylactic antibacterials for a relatively clean procedure such as arterial surgery includes second or third generation cephalosporins or co-amoxiclav as the drugs of choice. Bacteriostatic agents such as erythromycin are inappropriate. Flucloxacillin would not have a broad enough spectrum of activity to be considered appropriate. Metronidazole would be effective in cases where anaerobic agents would be considered problematic and would be used adjunctively in diabetic wounds, etc. Vancomycin would be an appropriate agent in those at suspected high risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or in units where MRSA is a problem. There is no standard regimen but co-amoxiclav appears to be the most common antibiotic used. Some local formularies add metronidazole because of the risk of faecal/anaerobic contamination in the groin. For those with penicillin allergy a single dose each of gentamicin and teicoplanin may be recommended +/- metronidazole. The important part is ensuring the antibiotic chosen has been given before the skin is incised."
basic medicine,1783,Which results from the interruption of the sympathetic nerve supply to the eye?,Extorsion,Intorsion,Miosis,Mydriasis,Myopia,C,"In the eye stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system results in constriction of the pupil (miosis), stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system results in dilatation of the pupil (mydriasis). Thus interrupting the sympathetic causes miosis. Balance between the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems controls the pupil size. Contraction of the superior and inferior recti and obliques results in a degree of wheel movement or torsion of the orbit. This can be either clockwise (intorsion) or anticlockwise (extorsion) and is controlled by the somatic motor part of the oculomotor nerve. Myopia (nearsighted) results when the eye and lens refract light too much. Most refraction of light occurs at the cornea. The lens is focused for near vision by the ciliary muscle and is supplied by parasympathetic fibres from the oculomotor nerve. The ciliary muscle has no opponent as the lens relies on elastic recoil."
basic medicine,1784,Choose the correct statement regarding phagocytic cells:,Are important for the resolution of inflammation,Have receptors that recognise viral membrane constituents ,Initiate firm attachment by binding to MHC class I on the endothelium ,Release histamine which affects the adaptive immune system ,Require clonal expansion to mount an effective response ,A,"The major phagocytic cells of the immune response are macrophages and neutrophils. Phagocytes of the innate immune system recognise common motifs on invading pathogens using cell surface pattern recognition receptors. They are part of the innate immune system and mount a rapid response that does not require clonal expansion. These cells phagocytose foreign particles and microbes. They are also important for the clearing of apoptotic cells and debris in the resolution phase. Phagocytic cells have surface receptors that recognise the Fc portion of immunoglobulin as well as complement components. Binding of these receptors to their ligands enhances phagocytosis of antigen - a process termed opsonisation. Internalised microbes are killed by phagocytes which secrete reactive oxygen intermediates and possess potent microbicidal properties. These cells initiate and amplify the adaptive immune response by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL1, IL6 and TNF. Phagocytic cells enter tissues by rolling on selectins and binding via integrins to ICAM (and similar molecules). They transmigrate by binding to PECAM and similar adhesion molecules. MAST cells release histamine when antigen binds and cross link cell surface IgE."

According to the Greentop Guidelines which of the following is appropriate?,Administer VZIG regardless of timing of rash onset,Admit for IV aciclovir,Administer VZIG if rash appeared with last 48 hours,Do not offer aciclovir regardless of rash timing,Give oral aciclovir if rash onset was within last 24 hours,E,Varicella Zoster Varicella Zoster is the virus responsible for Chicken pox and shingles. If Chickenpox occurs during pregnancy the Green Top Guidelines advise the following:VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has developed and should therefore not be used in pregnant women who have developed a chickenpox rash. Intravenous aciclovir should be given to all pregnant women with severe chickenpox Oral aciclovir should be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox if they present within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if they are 20+0 weeks of gestation or beyond. Use of aciclovir before 20+0 weeks should also be considered
basic medicine,1786,"A 65-year-old female presents with a three week history of malaise and blood in her sputum. Bronchoscopy reveals a mass in the right main bronchus, and histology demonstrates it to be a small cell carcinoma. Further investigation fails to show any metastases. What is the most appropriate initial step in management?",Chemotherapy ,Endobronchial laser therapy ,Symptom control only,Radiotherapy ,Surgery ,A,"This patient appears to have limited stage small cell lung carcinoma. These tumours are aggressive, and can metastasise quickly, but are very sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The standard treatment in the UK is combination chemo-radiation. Patients with a performance status of 0-1, with disease that can be encompassed in a radical thoracic radiotherapy volume, should be offered concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The chemotherapy should be initiated immediately, whilst the radiotherapy is being planned, and the radiotherapy should be started during either the first or second cycle of chemotherapy. Patients who are not fit enough for concurrent chemoradiotherapy should be offered sequential chemo-radiation: 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-etoposide chemotherapy with consolidative radiotherapy for those who respond to chemotherapy. Current programmes yield overall objective response rates of 65% to 90% and complete response rates of 45% to 75%. Because of the frequent presence of occult metastatic disease, chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer. Surgery is therefore not recommended as first-line treatment in the UK. Endobronchial laser therapy is not indicated in this situation. Symptom control (best supportive care) is only indicated for patients in whom chemotherapy is absolutely contraindicated. "
basic medicine,1787,"You are discussing the optimal medication for use in a patient who needs to withdraw from heroin. He seems motivated and would like to try tablet therapy. He failed to stay clean during the last month, having used street heroin on up to five occasions. Which of the following is the most effective in preventing use of heroin?",Buprenorphine,Buprenorphine and naloxone combination tablets,Codeine phosphate,Dihydrocodeine,Morphine,B,"Buprenorphine is a partial opiate agonist which binds mu and kappa opiate receptors in the brain. A partial agonist occupies and modulates the receptor without exerting the euphoric effects that would be gained by injecting IV heroin, a full agonist, because it does not exert the full effect. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist which binds at mu opioid receptors. This means that it blocks the action of opioid agonists such as morphine. The purpose of combining buprenorphine and naloxone for the treatment of opioid action is that it prevents addicts from achieving a high if they try to create an IV preparation from the tablets for injection.

basic medicine,1791,"You are the HO (house officer) in the hospital and the lab report of a patient shows glucose 4 mmol/l, K+ 5.2 mmol/l, Na+ 129 mmol/l. what is the most appropriate management?",NS 0.9%,NS 0.45%,NS 0.9% and insulin,Insulin,Dextrose,A,Here there is significant hyponatremia with mild hyperkalemia. Glucose is in lower normal level. Insulin can shift K+ in cells but this mild hyperkalemia does not need this treatment at this level. More over in lower blood glucose insulin may cause hypoglycemia. So the best management option is A. NS 0.9% which will correct the electrolyte imbalance (including K+ level by renal handling)
basic medicine,1792,"A 45-year-old woman presents to the oncology clinic with metastatic carcinoma of the breast. She wants to take an active role in deciding on the optimal chemotherapy regime for herself, and wants to discuss the relative advantages of capecitabine versus 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). What would you advise her about capecitabine?",Can be orally administered,Has a greater period of progression free survival than 5-FU,Is associated with less blood dyscrasias than 5-FU,Is not dependent on renal function,Is not usually associated with diarrhoea,A,"The major difference between capecitabine and 5-FU is that capecitabine is an oral prodrug of 5-FU. The final step in metabolism to 5-FU is thymidine phosphorylase, higher activity of thymidine phosphorylase occurring in tumour tissues. Evidence suggests that efficacy of capecitabine versus 5-FU is broadly similar, with minor, insignificant differences occurring in progression free survival in comparative studies across a range of primary tumour types. Whilst activation of capecitabine to 5-FU occurs after a number of steps, metabolites are still renally excreted, so in this sense, no significant advantage over 5-FU is conferred."

basic medicine,1800,"In a 73kg non-pregnant women, what is the typical oxygen consumption?",5ml/min,10ml/min,45ml/min,150ml/min,250ml/min,E,"The typical Oxygen Consumption (VO2) is 250ml/min. In pregnancy this increases by around 20% to 300ml/minLung volumes changes during typical pregnancy:Oxygen Consumption increases by approximately 20% Total lung capacity reduced by approximately 5%. Expiratory Reserve Volume reduced by approximately 20% Tidal volume is increased by approximately 50%. Functional residual capacity reduced by term by approximately 20%. Uterine enlargement displaces the diaphragm upwards by up to 4cm Gravid uterus enlargement limits the movement of the thoracic cage causing shortness of breath. Minute ventilation increase by about 50% during 1st trimester. pH remains normal or increases slightly due to renal compensation: HCO3- decreases FEV1 and FVC remain the same. PCO2 decreases. PO2 increases.Progesterone Progesterone gradually increases during the course of pregnancy, from 25 ng⋅mL−1 at 6 weeks’ to 150 ng⋅mL−1 at 37 weeks’ gestation. Progesterone acts as trigger of the primary respiratory center by increasing the sensitivity of the respiratory center to carbon dioxide, as indicated by the steeper slope of the ventilation curve in response to alveolar carbon dioxide changes. Progesterone alters the smooth muscle tone of the airways resulting in a bronchodilator effect. It also mediates hyperaemia and oedema of mucosal surfaces, causing nasal congestion.Oestrogen The circulating levels of oestrogen increase during pregnancy, before or in parallel to those of progesterone. Oestrogen is a mediator of progesterone receptors. It increases the number and the sensitivity of progesterone receptors within the hypothalamus and medulla, the central neuronal respiratory-related areas.Prostaglandins Prostaglandins stimulate uterine smooth muscle during labour and are present during all three trimesters of pregnancy. Prostaglandin F2α increases airway resistance by bronchial smooth muscle constriction, whereas a bronchodilator effect can be a consequence of prostaglandins E1 and E2."

basic medicine,1830,A 62-year-old woman is scheduled to undergo excision of her submandibular gland for recurrent sialadenitis. Which of the following structures is an important medial relation to the gland?,Genioglossus muscle,Lateral pterygoid muscle,Mylohyoid muscle,The maxillary artery,The temporomandibular joint,C,The mylohyoid muscle is a close medial relation to the superficial part of the submandibular gland. The genioglossus muscle originates from the mandible and then attaches to the tongue and hyoid bone. The lateral pterygoid muscle is two-headed and located in the infratemporal fossa of the skull and helps with chewing and movement of the tempromandibular joint. The maxillary artery arises posterior to the mandibular neck and passes between the sphenomandibular ligament and ramus of the mandible.

basic medicine,1833,A 19 year old female presents to her GP with non specific symptoms of muscle weakness. You note she appears slim. She denies any other specific symptoms and states she is otherwise well. Bloods reveal hypokalaemia and a bicarbonate of 16. She also has an elevated amylase. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Furosemide abuse,Bulimia Nervosa,Bartter's syndrome,Gitelmann's syndrome,Chronic Pancreatitis,B,"Metabolic alkalosis, hypokalaemia and hyperamylasaemia are metabolic complications of bulimia. Hyperamylasaemia can occur due to hypersecretion from salivary glands due to excessive vomiting. Vomiting also leads to hypokalaemia which if severe can lead to metabolic acidosis. Both gitelmann's syndrome and bartters syndrome have other metabolic abnormalities and are usually present at a young age and hyperamylasemia is not found."

basic medicine,1836,Which of the following cytotoxic agents acts by inhibiting purine synthesis?,Bleomycin,Cisplatin,Doxorubicin,Methotrexate,Vincristine,D,"Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase , thereby inhibiting the production of tetrhydrofolate required for thymidine and purine synthesis. It is therefore cytotoxic during the S-phase of the cell cycle, and has a greater toxic effect on rapidly dividing cells. Bleomycin acts by inducing DNA strand breaks. Cisplatin crosslinks DNA, initiating DNA repair mechanisms and subsequently apoptosis. Doxorubicin inhibits the action of topoisomerase II, which is required for DNA transcription. Vincristine is an vinca alkaloid, which disrupts microtubules and thereby arrests mitosis in metaphase."
basic medicine,1837,The rectus sheath is formed by which of the following?,Rectus abdominus and pyramidalis aponeuroses,"aponeuroses of transversus abdominis, external and internal oblique",External oblique and rectus abdominus aponeuroses,Internal oblique and rectus abdominus aponeuroses,aponeuroses of internal and external oblique,B,"The rectus sheath is formed by the aponeuroses of the transversus abdominis and the external and internal oblique muscles.

basic medicine,1838,A 65-year-old man is admitted from home with a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). He has a history of skin rash to penicillin documented in his medical notes. He has adverse prognostic features and a CURB score of 4. What would be an appropriate empirical antibiotic choice?,Augmentin,Augmentin and gentamycin,Cefotaxime and erythromycin,Cefuroxime and metronidazole,Ciprofloxacin and clarithromycin,C,"Community-acquired pneumonia is most commonly caused by Strep. pneumoniae, hence the use of a beta-lactam antibiotic. Because of the increased incidence of atypical organisms such as Mycoplasma, a macrolide such as erythromycin is also recommended. Augmentin is contraindicated as it is penicillin-based. Ciprofloxacin has poor cover against Strep. pneumoniae and metronidazole is used for anaerobic infections. In this case a credible alternative for beta-lactam sensitivity is not mentioned and the best choice, because of clinical necessity since severe pneumonia can be fatal if treated with antibiotics that are not effective, is to go with the only cephalosporin and macrolide combination that is offered. The chance of cross reactivity of penicillin allergy with beta-lactams is only 10%. A rash is not a contraindication for this.  If the patient has a documented anaphylactic reaction sepcifically to penicillin then this case would need to be discussed between the medical and microbiology consultants before the prescription was given. Different trusts have different policies regarding this and consequently it is highly unlikely you will be tested on this."

She is having difficulty sleeping because of this and she has missed a few days of work due to tiredness and feels embarrassed in work when she is  having flushes. She has a history of migraines. Her FSH is 40 IU/L and other bloods including TFTs are normal. What is the next course of action?",Low dose vaginal oestrogen,Commence HRT - cyclical combined transdermal patches,Nil specific,Commence HRT - continuous combined transdermal patches,Commence HRT - continuous combined oral,D,"There is controversy over the use of Hormone Replacement Therapy as studies have shown little evidence of benefits however increased risk of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disease, endometrial cancer in oestrogen only and combined HRT over the age of 75 may increase risk of dementia. It is therefore only indicated when the risks outweigh the benefits such as those with severe symptoms as in this case which is interfering with life or those who have an early menopause (<45). In those who have had a hysterectomy then oestrogen only combinations are required. In this case there is no history of this and thus combined therapy is required. The FSH indicates level indicates this lady is most likely post menopausal therefore continuous combined HRT is indicated whilst in perimenopausal then cyclical can be used. If there is only urogenital symptoms the low dose vaginal oestrogens may be tried. There is many routes however if the patient has a history of migraines they may benefit from transdermal patches due to steadier hormone levels."

basic medicine,1848,A 59-year-old male presents with a three day history of marked muscle aches and weakness. He has ischaemic heart disease for which he takes a number of drugs including simvastatin and has been taking these drugs for a number of years without any problem. On this occasion his CPK confirms a diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis with a level of 4200 IU/L (less than200). Which of the following health supplements is he most likely to have taken that would have contributed to the statin-induced rhabdomyolysis?,Cod liver oil capsules,Cranberry juice,Ginseng,Grapefruit juice,Vitamin C,D,"Grapefruit juice significantly increases serum concentrations of some statins. This is achieved by reducing the CYP3A4-mediated first-pass metabolism in the small intestine. Concomitant use of atorvastatin and large amounts of grapefruit juice should be avoided, or the dose of atorvastatin should be reduced accordingly. CYP3A4 is a member of the cytochrome P450 system. Whilst an interaction is increasingly being recognised between cranberry juice and warfarin, there has as yet been no interaction with other drugs metabolised via the P450 system. No interaction has been shown between statins, omega-3 fish oils, ginseng or vitamin C "
basic medicine,1849,A 71-year-old man is treated for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with 200 mg of amiodarone per day. He is finding extreme problems with photosensitivity and wants to discontinue the medication. Which of the following is true of amiodarone therapy?,It has a half life of 36 hours so stopping the medication will be associated with an immediate improvement,Photosensitivity is a rare occurrence,Purple skin discoloration is seen independent of photosensitivity,Skin sensitivity can be prevented by using a sun block,Thyroid dysfunction is seen more commonly in patients who experience photosensitivity,D,"Photosensitivity is seen very commonly in those patients who are prescribed amiodarone therapy. It is distinct from the slate grey skin discolouration which can occur with prolonged amiodarone use and can be prevented by using a total sun block preparation. The half life of amiodarone has a mean of around 50 days, and may be as short as 20 days in some individuals and as long as 100 days in others. Slate grey or blue skin appearance is the commonest pigmentation change seen in association with treatment. The incidence of amiodarone induced thyroid dysfunction has no relationship at all to photosensitivity."

basic medicine,1853,A 90-year-old man with chronic myeloid leukaemia presents with gout following treatment which his general practitioner treats with allopurinol. How does allopurinol prevent the accumulation of uric acid?,By competing for its transporter to the kidney,By enhancing its solubility,By inhibiting purine breakdown and synthesis,By inhibiting pyrimidine synthesis,By inhibiting the inflammatory response it causes,C,"Allopurinol is an isomer of hypoxanthine and as such is a purine analogue. It acts by inhibiting xanthine oxidase thereby blocking the oxidation of hypoxathine and xanthine. This reduces the production of uric acid. In addition, the build up of hypoxanthine and xanthine results in their conversion to adenosine and guanosine. This causes feedback inhibition of amidophosphoribosyl transferase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of purine biosynthesis. Allopurinol therefore reduces both purine breakdown and synthesis. It should not be used in combination with Rasburicase as the two counteract each other."
basic medicine,1854,"Which of the following, used in conventional doses, would be an effective pre-operative anti-emetic?",Atropine,Lorazepam,Metoclopramide,Midazolam,Ondansetron,E,"Atropine, an anticholinergic, is seldom used for its anti-emetic effects which are weak, as it causes tachycardia and is preferentially used to dry up secretions. Midazolam and lorazepam are benzodiazepines and are anxiolytics. Metoclopramide is used pre-operatively to stimulate gastrointestinal emptying, but is rather ineffective due to short duration of action as a pre-operative anti-emetic in standard doses (10 mg). Ondansetron is an effective anti-emetic."
basic medicine,1855,In which of the following chemotherapeutic agents is the cumulative dose limited due to cardiotoxicity?,Cisplatin,Epirubicin,Etoposide,Herceptin (trastuzumab),Methotrexate,B,Epirubicin and the other anthracycline chemotherapeutic agents are extremely potent but are limited by dose constraints. Cumulative doses of over 900 mg/m^2 can lead to significant cardiac toxicity and heart failure. Herceptin can cause direct myocardial damage and must be monitored with regular echocardiograms but it is not limited to a maximum lifetime dose.

On examination she has a Glasgow coma score of 6, a respiratory rate of 8 breaths per minute, a heart rate of 52 beats per minute and her blood pressure is 84/62 mmHg. Her pupils are small but are reactive to light, muscle tone is reduced and plantar responses are flexor. Which of the following is she most likely to have taken in overdose?",Diazepam,Dihydrocodeine,Diphenhydramine,Ecstasy (MDMA),Methanol,B,"Dihydrocodeine is an opiate analgesic and when taken in overdose has a number of toxic effects. It acts as a respiratory depressant leading to reduced respiratory rate. It can cause bradycardia and hypotension in large doses. Pupillary constriction is a diagnostic feature in opiate overdose. It is also a central nervous system depressant and therefore causes coma in overdose. Benzodiazepines and antihistamines tend not to have the same cardiorespiratory effects as opiates. MDMA is a stimulant and can cause delirium, convulsions and ventricular arrhythmias. Diazepam would be less likely here due to the bradycardia and the hypotension."
basic medicine,1857,"Regarding bacterial plasmids, which of the following statements is true?",Always contain genes for enzymes that modify antibiotics,Are responsible for endotoxaemic shock,Are responsible for transferring all resistance to penicillins,May be transferred by conjugation between different strains,May consist of a circular molecule of double-stranded RNA,D,"Bacterial plasmids comprise a group of extra-chromosomal, usually circular, molecules of double-stranded DNA, and they may contain genetic information for various bacterial characteristics (e.g. toxin production, adhesins, etc.) as well as enzymes. They can replicate autonomously (that is independently from the bacterial chromosome), and larger plasmids are transferred naturally by conjugation between bacterial strains.

basic medicine,1861,Which layer of the epidermis determines the primary mechanical properties of skin?,Dermis,Stratum basale,Stratum corneum,Stratum granulosum,Subcutaneous tissue,C,"The stratum corneum (andquot;horny layerandquot;) is the outermost layer and provides a mechanical barrier to the skin, therefore determining the mechanical functions of the skin. The hands and feet have thick stratum corneum compared to the lips and eyelids. The thicker the stratum corneum is the more protection there is for the skin. The dermis also has some factor to play with its elastic fibres and fibrous tissue. The rest of the layers are also important but the mechanical properties are primarily determined by the stratum corneum. The stratum basale is the innermost layer and generates keratinocytes which migrate through the stratum spinosum to the stratum granulosum, where they are involved in keratin binding, before transforming into corneocytes that make up the stratum corneum."

It is likely caused by a reduction in lower esophageal sphincter pressure due to an increase in maternal estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy. Reflux MedicationThe Proton Pump of gastric parietal cells has 3 main receptors (histamine, gastrin and acetylcholine) that if agonised will stimulate proton (H+ or 'acid') release. H2 is the most significant receptor and stimulation of this pathway is thought to account for around 85% of proton pump stimulation. Ranitidine and other H2 antagonists block this receptor reducing proton pump stimulationPPIs work by blocking the whole proton pump from working."

Which of the following, when taken concurrently with the combined contraceptive pill, is most likely to increase the risk of pregnancy?",Cimetidine,Erythromycin,Fluconazole,Fluoxetine,St John's wort,E,"St John's wort is a potent CYP-450 inducer, and use can lead to rapid decreases in sex steroids administered as the combined pill.  Fluconazole is a 2C9 inhibitor Fluoxetine a 2C19 inhibitor Erythromycin a 3A4 inhibitor Cimetidine an inhibitor of 1A2 and 2D6.  As such all four of the other potential choices should not affect contraceptive effectiveness because they do not lead to a decrease in sex steroid levels. Potent enzyme inducers which may cause significantly decreased pill effectiveness include rifampicin and carbamazepine. Other antibiotics such as the tetracyclines which may be used in this population for example in the treatment of acne, are known to lead to decreased pill efficacy."

basic medicine,1868,What percentage of patients undergoing radiotherapy develop fatigue as an acute side effect?,5%,10%,25%,50%,80%,E,Fatigue is the most common acute side effect of radiotherapy i.e. develops during treatment or within 2 to 3 weeks of complication. It occurs acutely in around 80% of patients and in a chronic form (>6 months after completion) in 30% of patients.Nausea and vomiting is another common acute side effect occurring in around 60% of patients. In pelvic radiotherapy gastrointestinal reactions are very common with 70% developing diarrhoea or colic. Radiotherapy Radiotherapy Key PointsIonizing radiation Causes DNA damage leading to cellular death DNA damage caused by ionisation leading to free radical formation Can be locally placed i.e Brachythrapy or external beam To reduce damage to normal tissue shaped and multiple beams are used with a higher absorbed dose at the point of convergence Radiosensitizers increase the effect of a given dose of radiation Radiosensitisers fall into 4 main groups:1. Oxygen2. Hypoxic cell sensitizers3. Halogenated Pyrimidines4. Bioreductive AgentsRadioprotectors are agents that reduce the effects of radiation. Their role is limited in clinical practice due to possible protection of tumours Radiotherapy dosing is in Gray (Gy). Total dose varies between tumour type and stage but typical regimes involve 1.8-2.0 Gy fractions delivered over a number of weeks with total dose accumulating to reach around 50 Gy (a comprehensive list can be found using the link on the right but is likely beyond the scope of the MRCOG exam)

basic medicine,1871,Which anatomical relations of the scalenus muscles is true?,The ascending cervical artery lies lateral to the phrenic nerve,The phrenic nerve passes behind scalenus anterior,The subclavian artery and vein are separated by scalenus medius,The subclavian vein forms the brachiocephalic vein at the lateral border of scalenus anterior,The trunks of the brachial plexus emerge from the lateral border of scalenus anterior,E,"The ascending cervical artery, medial to the phrenic nerve on scalenus anterior, can easily be mistaken for the phrenic nerve at operation. The phrenic nerve passes inferiorly across scalenus anterior and medius. The subclavian artery and vein are separated by scalenus anterior. The subclavian vein joins with the internal jugular vein, to form the brachiocephalic vein at the medial border of scalenus anterior. The trunks of the brachial plexus emerge from the lateral border of scalenus anterior."
basic medicine,1872,Which one of the following nerve roots mediates the abdominal reflex?,"L5, S1","L3, L4","C5, C6","T7, T8, T9",L1,D,"The lower abdominal reflex is elicited by placing the patient in a supine position with the knees slightly bent. Use the handle end of the reflex hammer to stroke the skin, moving lateral to medial. The normal response is ipsilateral contraction of the rectus muscle with an observed deviation of the umbilicus towards the stroke. The abdominal reflex is mediated by T7‐T12 not L1. The cremasteric reflex is mediated by L1. When the abdominal wall is very obese, pull the skin to the opposite side, and feel it contract towards the stimuli."
basic medicine,1873,"A 65-year-old woman usually takes Warfarin for a history of recurrent DVTs. Her Warfarin is stopped and she is started on intravenous heparin prior to cardiac bypass for ischaemic heart disease. She seems to require very high doses of heparin to achieve adequate anticoagulation, especially during surgery. Which of the following conditions would explain her thrombophilia and her heparin resistance?",Activated protein C resistance,Antithrombin III deficiency,Lupus anticoagulant,Protein C deficiency,Protein S deficiency,B,"Heparin resistance is seen in up to 22% of patients undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Several mechanisms resulting in heparin resistance have been identified, including antithrombin deficiency, increased heparin clearance, elevated heparin-binding proteins, and elevated factor VIII and fibrinogen levels. For cardiopulmonary bypass in particular, rapid neutralisation of thrombin is required. In order for heparin to be successful in this, it requires antithrombin III which is an alpha2-globulin. It is therefore thought that antitthrombin III deficiency is the underlying problem which is seen in patients resistant to heparin during cardiopulmonary bypass. The other four answers describe conditions where there is an increased risk of thrombosis, but they are not specifically associated with resistance to heparin. "
basic medicine,1874,A 68-year-old female with terminal bowel cancer is receiving optimal doses of morphine sulphate therapy. Which of the following effects may be expected with the addition of a partial opioid agonist?,Increased analgesic effect,Increased respiratory depression,Increased sedation,No change,Reduced analgesic effect,E,"Partial opioid agonists (for example, buprenorphine), when used in association with morphine, may produce a reduction in the analgesic effect due to partial antagonism. This is an aspect of pain management that needs to be considered when using combination therapies."
basic medicine,1875,Which of the following is true regarding the radial nerve?,Gives off an anterior interosseous branch,Is derived from the posterior primary rami of the C5 to T1 nerve roots,Is the main nerve supply to the flexor compartments of the arm and forearm,Is the principal branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus,Supplies sensation to the extensor aspect of the distal two phalanges of the radial three and a half digits,D,"The radial nerve is the continuation of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus. The brachial plexus is formed by the anterior roots of C5 to T1 spinal nerves. The roots of C5 and C6 join together to form the upper trunk. C7 continues as the middle trunk while C8 and T1 join to form the lower trunk. Each of these trunks divides into anterior and posterior division. All the posterior divisions join to form the posterior cord while the anterior divisions of the upper and middle trunks join to form the lateral cord and the anterior division of the lower trunk continues as the medial cord. It is the principal motor supply to muscles of the extensor compartments of the arm, forearm and the dorsum of the hand. Surface marking of radial nerve is from the point where the posterior wall of axilla and the arm meet to a point two thirds of the way along the line, joining the acromion to the lateral epicondyle and thence to the front of the epicondyle. The radial nerve supplies all the muscles of the posterior compartment of the arm, gives sensory branches to the skin overlying the posterior compartment and lateral aspect of the arm, and divides in the anterior compartment of forearm into posterior interosseous nerve and its terminal superficial branch. Through these branches it supplies extensor muscles and skin on the lateral aspect of the forearm. It supplies the skin over the proximal phalanges on the extensor aspect of the radial three and half digits. The dorsal aspect of the distal two phalanges is supplied by median nerve (its branches)."
basic medicine,1876,The main stimulus for anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) release is?,Low serum osmolality,High serum osmolality,Reduced ICF volume,High Blood volume,Low blood volume,B,"Decreased blood volume/reduced ECF does also stimulate ADH but the hypothalamus is less sensitive to this.Vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone (ADH) or arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a nonapeptide synthesized in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary glandSecreted in response to an increase in serum osmolality which stimulates receptors in hypothalamus that detects the osmolarity change and stimulate the posterior pituitary to secrete ADH (This is the main stimulus), results in water retention by:ADH then acts primarily in the kidneys to increase water reabsorption, thus returning the osmolarity to baseline.promotes the movement and insertion of water channel proteins called aquaporins into the apical membrane of the the collecting duct and DCT Increased activity of urea transport proteins in the collecting duct promoting urea flow out of the collecting duct and water via increased osmotic gradient Increased sodium reabsorption across the ascending loop of Henle Vasopressin is also a vasoconstrictor promotes contraction of vascular smooth muscle leading to increases in total peripheral resistance and thus increases in blood pressure. This mechanism is synergistic with water reabsorption in that both mechanisms elevate blood pressure. This mechanism is crucial in periods where sufficient arterial blood volume is low to maintain tissue perfusionand is stimulated when decreases in plasma volume which is detected by baroreceptors in the atria and carotid sinus"
basic medicine,1877,Which of the following is true of cabergoline?,Has a half life of 8 hours,Is an effective antiemetic,May cause parkinsonian side effects,Is used during pregnancy,Is a dopamine agonist,E,"Cabergoline is a dopamine agonist used in Parkinson's disease but also in the treatment of hyperprolactinaemia (prolactinomas).Studies reveal that it is more effective than bromocriptine in the treatment of prolactinomas and is far better tolerated. However as a dopamine agonist side effects include nausea and hypotension.The drug is taken twice weekly and unlike bromocriptine has a particularly long half life.In women with prolactin‐secreting tumours wanting to become pregnant, cabergoline is not licensed and bromocriptine is used.Although there is no evidence that DA therapy is harmful during pregnancy, as soon as patients find out that they are pregnant, the dopamine agonist is stopped."
basic medicine,1878,"Your consultant is in the coffee room and has left you operating on a patient with very large, tortuous varicose veins. Where should you make the skin incision so that you are over the sapheno-femoral junction?",3 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle,3 cm below and medial to the pubic tubercle,Anterior to the medial malleolus,Halfway between the pubic symphysis and the ASIS,Halfway between the pubic tubercle and the ASIS,A,"The surface marking of the sapheno-femoral junction is 2 to 3 cm below and lateral to the pubic tubercle. The great saphenous vein and femoral vein can be differentiated at surgery because the saphenous vein receives tributaries (superficial and deep external pudendal veins, superficial inferior epigastric vein and superficial inferior epigastria vein). The great saphenous vein runs anterior to the medial malleolus and is an important site for emergency venous access. The mid inguinal point occurs halfway between the pubic symphysis and the ASIS and the mid point of the inguinal ligament halfway between the pubic tubercle and the ASIS. There is still sometimes a place for open surgery for varicose veins."
basic medicine,1879,What is the dicrotic notch produced by?,Closure of aortic valve,Opening of mitral valve,Closure of mitral valve,closure of pulmonary valve,Opening of aortic valve,A,The dicrotic notch occurs when the aortic valve closes and produces a secondary upstroke in the downward part of the pulse wave. Intra aortic balloon pumps are utilised in cardiogenic shock. They inflate during diastole to increase blood flow to the coronary arteries and deflate during systole which results in a reduced after load and increased flow.
basic medicine,1880,"In pancreatitis, which one of the following may indicate a poor prognosis on admission?",Age greater than50 years,An elevated haematocrit,Blood glucose less than10 mmol/L,Systolic blood pressure less than90 mmHg,Temperature greater than38°C,D,"Acute pancreatitis is an autodigestive disease process, where pancreatic proteolytic enzymes are activated and subsequently destroy the pancreatic parenchyma. The gland can be destroyed by oedema, haemorrhage and fat necrosis, which release an exudate into the peritoneal cavity causing peritonitis. Sepsis, respiratory and renal failure may occur which increases the mortality from this disease. A poor prognosis may be indicated by:  Age greater than55 years Systolic blood pressure less than90 mmHg White cell count greater than15 ×10^9/L Temperature greater than39°C Blood glucose greater than10 mmol/L Arterial PO2 less than8 kPa (60 mmHg) Plasma urea greater than16 mmol/L Serum calcium less than2 mmol/L A reduced haematocrit by greater than10%, and Deranged liver function tests.

basic medicine,1882,A 68-year-old man is found to have an elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA). Which of the following is a feature of PSA?,Causes disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) when released in high concentrations in the blood,Is a proteolytic enzyme,Is not normally found in blood,Is produced by endothelial cells of the prostate,Levels are not expected to rise following urinary catheterisation,B,"PSA is a serine proteinase, a proteinolytic enzyme that is produced by the epithelial cells of the prostate and is involved in the liquefaction of the seminal fluid. Small concentrations may be found in the blood and these may occur due to absorption across the prostate and urethral epithelium particularly following ejaculation. Hence the recommendation is to avoid measuring PSA for two days after ejaculation. It does not appear to have any detrimental effect when released into the blood. Levels can rise following manipulation but evidence would indicate that there is no or just a small rise after rectal examination. However, levels may rise after more direct manipulation such as catheterisation or cystoscopy."
basic medicine,1883,With regard to the cell cycle. At what stage do the chromosomes align on the equatorial plane?,S phase,Metaphase,Anaphase,G2 phase,Cytokinesis,B,"G0 is a resting phase. Interphase (G1,S,G2) is where the cell grows and DNA replication occurs forming chromatids. Mitosis is where cell division occurs and this happens in a the following phases:Prophase Chromatin condenses to chromosomes (paired as chromatids). Mitotic spindle forms Metaphase Chromatids align at the equatorial plane AKA the metaphase plate Anaphase Chromotids pulled apart into 2 constituent daughter chromosomes Telophase New nuclear envelopes form around each daughter chromosome Cytokinesis Cells divideCell CyclePhase Name State DescriptionG0 Resting Resting stateG1 Interphase Cells increase in sizeS Interphase DNA replicationG2 Interphase Cells increase in sizeM Mitosis Cells divide in subphasesProphase Metaphase Anaphase Telophase Cytokinesis"

basic medicine,1886,"A 44-year-old woman, with a history of alcohol abuse, is brought to the Emergency Department after a large haematemesis. Fluid resuscitation is started but the bleeding is ongoing. At an emergency endoscopy the gastroenterologist sees that she is bleeding from varices in the lower part of her oesophagus. Which vein drains this area into the portal system?",Azygous vein,Inferior mesenteric vein,Left gastric vein,Lower oesophageal vein,Thoracic vein,C,"Varicosities are formed at areas of connection between the systemic venous and portal venous systems. The most important area clinically is in the lower osesophagus; haemorrhage in this area can be fatal. The left gastric vein drains this area into the portal vein. The azygous vein is part of the systemic venous system. Other important sites of anastamosis are the peri-umbilical region, the bare area of the liver, the retroperitoneum and the anal canal."

basic medicine,1888,"A 67-year-old man with chronic renal failure, who uses peritoneal dialysis, presents to the renal ward with a cloudy bag. This is his first episode of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis in over two years of dialysing. He has type 1 diabetes, which precipitated his renal impairment. On examination, he is pyrexial at 38.2°C. His abdomen is diffusely tender, although he has bowel sounds on auscultation. Investigations showed:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 13.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 270 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 346 μmol/L (79-118)   Dialysis fluid greater than100 white cells per mm^3    Which of the following is the most likely infecting organism?",B. fragilis,Bacteroides spp,P. aeruginosa,S. aureus,S. pyogenes,D,"S. aureus and S. epidermidis are the two most common pathogens identified in cases of CAPD peritonitis. Various treatment regimes exist, but the majority involve intraperitoneal vancomycin and an oral quinolone. Once culture results are received, the regime can then be tailored appropriately. The key to avoiding long-term complications of CAPD peritonitis is prompt intervention to avoid chronic colonisation of the CAPD catheter and adhesion formation, which prevents adequate fluid exchange."
basic medicine,1889,"A 20-year-old male presents with bleeding oesophageal varices. On examination, he has Kayser-Fleischer rings in the cornea. Which of the following is the inheritance of this disorder?",Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Polygenic inheritance,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,B,"This patient has Wilson's disease which is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion due to a mutation on the long arm of chromosome 13, characterised by excessive hepatic copper deposition. Cirrhosis is the most common initial presentation. Kaiser-Fleischer rings occur in 90% of patients but may also occur in chronic cholestatic disease. There are also neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, haematological, renal features."
basic medicine,1890,To which of the following is Staphylococcus aureus not sensitive?,Methicillin,Flucloxacillin,Metronidazole,Cefuroxime,Vancomycin,C,"S. aureus is sensitive to vancomycin, as are most other Gram positive organisms. Vancomycin is also used in the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis if metronidazole is contraindicated.Cefuroxime is broad‐spectrum and also has good Gram negative activity. It is very useful in surgery for prophylaxis and post‐operative infections.Flucloxacillin is used in the treatment of Gram positive (‐lactamase) producers, such as S. aureus.Metronidazole has activity against anaerobic bacteria only. S. aureus is sensitive to methicillin. However, methicillin‐resistant S. aureus were detected in 1961 soon after methicillin was introduced."
basic medicine,1891,What is the principal constituent difference between human breast milk and cow's milk?,Triglycerides,Carbohydrate,Lactose,Casein,Total protein,D,"Although cow's milk contains 3.3% total protein (compared with 1.5% in human breast milk), casein is the major constituent difference (80%/40% respectively). Cow's milk is not suitable for infant feeding due to insufficient iron, vitamin E, and essential fatty acids. Consequently, an infant fed on cow's milk would become anaemic.Additionally, the high concentrations of proteins and electrolytes can potentially damage immature kidneys in the infant and render the milk difficult to absorb from the juvenile gastrointestinal system."
basic medicine,1892,You are investigating the properties of a novel oral TNF-alpha antagonist in late stage clinical trials.  Which of the following would be an expected property of this agent?,Decreased endothelial reactivity,Decreased HDL cholesterol,Decreased insulin sensitivity,Decreased protein catabolism,Increased acute phase protein production,D,"Increased levels of TNF-alpha are known to result in protein catabolism, weight loss, and muscle weakness: all features of disseminated carcinoma where TNF-alpha is elevated. As such an antagonist of TNF-alpha would be expected to result in decreased protein catabolism. Chronic inflammatory disorders including those associated with elevated tumour necrosis factor (TNF) are noted to be associated with increased arteriolar stiffness and decreased endothelial reactivity. TNF-alpha elevation is also known to be associated with increased insulin resistance and associated lipid abnormalities such as decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Increased acute phase protein production is a feature of chronic inflammation; as such, a TNF-alpha antagonist is recognised to reduce this."
basic medicine,1893,Which of the following genetic malfunctions would result in severe learning difficulties and congenital heart disease?,Balanced translocation,Unipaternal disomy,Reciprocal translation,Paracentric inversion,Unbalanced translocation,E,"This description is of Down syndrome, which is due to an unbalanced chromosomal translocation. This is when parts of different chromosomes are swapped in an uneven manner. With Down syndrome, this is due to no disjunction. Balanced autosomal translocations do not normally cause disease"
basic medicine,1894,Which of the following is most likely to lead to drug induced lupus?,Gold,Penicilliamine,Phenytoin,Phenothiazines,Hydralazine,E,"Hydralazine, quinidine and procainamide are common causes of drug induced lupus.

"
basic medicine,1896,Proteolytic enzymes are released by which one of the following organisms?,All Clostridium botulinum,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Neisseria meningitides,Salmonella typhi,Streptococcus pyogenes,E,"Virulence factors are important in the bacterial survival in vivo. In this sense bacterial extracellular proteolytic enzymes can be recognised as the legitimate target for this approach, since they are involved either in direct or indirect destruction of an infected/colonised tissue and in dysregulation of many host defence pathways. The best example of the last is an effect of bacterial proteinases on fibrinolytic, kallikrein-kinin and complement cascades, as well as degradation of immunoglobulins, inactivation of endogenous proteinase inhibitors, and dysregulation of cytokine network system. Proteolytic enzymes are responsible for the virulence and activity of organisms such as Strep. pyogenes, Staph. aureus, Escherichia coli and Clostridium welchii enabling the necrolytic effects on the skin in cellulitis and gangrene. Group II Clostridium botulinum are non-proteolytic (toxins B, E and F). Group I are proteolytic (toxins A, B and F) so produce food spoilage."
basic medicine,1897,A 15-week pregnant woman is exposed to a family member with an erythematous rash. She has previously been immunised with MMR twice. What is the most appropriate next test?,Parvovirus B19 IgG,Parvovirus B19 IgM,Measles IgM,Rubella IgM,Toxoplasma IgG,B,"As she has had two MMR immunisations the patient is likely to be immune against measles and rubella. The concern is that she has been exposed to parvovirus B19, which is common. This can be confirmed or excluded by testing specific IgM. Failure to detect these antibodies excludes infection in the four weeks prior to testing. If parvovirus B19 IgM is detected in the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, infection should be confirmed by alternative assay (e.g. B19 DNA, IgG seroconversion). If Parvovirus B19 is confirmed, current evidence suggests that intrauterine transfusion of the foetus improves prognosis. Specialist assessment is required, and usually, serial ultrasound scans with Doppler if hydrops fetalis develops. "
basic medicine,1898,Which is true in hypothermia?,A metabolic alkalosis is a common finding,Hypertension is often seen during re-warming,Pancreatitis is a recognised complication,Passive re-warming is advised for all patients,The oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the right,C,"Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature of less than 35°C, and is associated with:  hypopituitarism hypothyroidism spinal cord trauma alcohol, and drug overdose.  In hypothermic patients the oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left. A metabolic acidosis is commonly seen in hypothermia, and is exacerbated by a reduction in hepatic clearance and renal excretion of hydrogen ions and lactic acid. Other complications of hypothermia include:  acute pancreatitis hyperglycaemia thrombocytopaenia, and a coagulopathy.  Passive re-warming is appropriate when the core temperature is above 33°C (not all patients), but active measures are required when the temperature is lower. Hypotension may be seen as the core temperature rises, as hypovolaemia is revealed, and will usually require fluid resuscitation."

basic medicine,1900,"A 44-year-old woman presents to the clinic with increasing lethargy and fatigue. She has been treated previously with interferon alpha and has a diagnosis of chronic myeloid leukaemia. Her white blood cell count has risen to 22 ×10^3 cells per microlitre, and she is anaemic with a recent haemoglobin of 89 g/L. You decide to start her on imatinib. Which of the following correctly describes the mode of action of imatinib?",Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor,Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor,Fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor,HER2 receptor inhibitor,Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor,A,"The answer is Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor. In chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) this particular kinase is stuck chronically in the andquot;onandquot; position. By targeting the kinase, imatinib inhibits the unregulated cell division which occurs in CML and can maintain many patients in remission for a number of years. There is also a role for imatinib in the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumours, where targeting of Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase has been shown to impact on progression of tumour size. Other small molecules used in the treatment of cancer include trastuzumab which targets the human epidermal growth factor 2, used in the treatment of breast cancer, and sunitinib, which inhibits multiple kinases which are stimulated by agonism of a number of receptors including VEGF receptors, RET and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors.

Beneath the breast there is a condensation of superficial fascia which acts as a posterior capsule for the breast. There is a subareloar lymphatic plexus. Most of the lymph of the breast drains to the axilla, with lymph from the lateral breast draining into the axillary and infraclavicular nodes. Medially the lymph drains through the intercostal spaces into the parasternal (internal thoracic) nodes. However lymph from the breast may drain into any of the lymphatic basins and if one pathway becomes blocked another is utilised."

Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",Factor VII,FFP,Oral vitamin K 1 mg,Prothrombin complex concentrate,Stop warfarin only,C,"A conjunctival bleed is defined as a minor bleed, and current guidelines suggest that oral or IV vitamin K together with the omission of warfarin, is the treatment of choice. Local guidelines should also be available. One must always weigh up the risks and benefits of reversing the anticoagulation. The patient described is at low risk if the warfarin-induced coagulopathy is reversed. There is no suggestion from the ECG and the haemodynamic status that there is pulmonary embolus. Major bleeds are defined as intraorbital, intracranial, retroperitoneal or muscular bleeding causing compartment syndrome. Any acute bleeding with BP less than 90 mmHg, oliguria or Hb drop to less than 90 g/L, also count as major bleeding episodes and require aggressive reversal of the coagulopathy with vitamin K, stopping warfarin and prothrombin complex concentrate or fresh frozen plasma (FFP)."

basic medicine,1907,Which of the following is true regarding carotid sinus baroreceptors?,As the blood pressure increases the discharge from these receptors is reduced,In chronic hypertension the baroreceptors reflex is reset,Similar receptors are located in the superior vena cava,"They are innervated by the carotid sinus nerve, which is a branch of the vagus",They can be found in the external carotid artery distal to the carotid body,B,"The carotid sinus baroreceptors are stretch receptors (not pressure) that control blood pressure and heart rate by a feedback mechanism. They are located in the internal carotid artery, distal to the carotid bifurcation but proximal to the carotid body, (the latter arises from the external carotid artery). Similar baroreceptors are found in the aortic arch, atria and left ventricle. The carotid sinus nerve, which is a branch of the ninth cranial nerve, receives afferent fibres from the carotid sinus and carotid body, and ascends to the vasomotor centre. As the distending pressure in the artery increases, the discharge rate from the baroreceptors increases, which stimulates the cardioinhibitory centre, causing a fall in blood pressure, heart rate and cardiac output. In chronic hypertension, in order to maintain an elevated blood pressure, the reflex mechanism is reversibly reset."

Angiotensin is an octapeptide. Angiotensinogen is a plasma protein that gives rise to angiotensin I and then angiotensin II catabolised by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (mostly in the lungs). Its production is induced with reduced circulating blood volume, hypotension, reduced sodium, etc. "
basic medicine,1910,"With respect to lipoprotein transport and metabolism in the body, which of the following statements is incorrect?",Arterial walls contain cells with LDL receptors,Cholesterol is required for the formation of red blood cell membranes,Chylomicrons are synthesised in the liver,HDL is assembled in the extracellular space,VLDL transformation to LDL occurs in the liver,C,"Chylomicrons are formed in the gut from exogenous triacylglycerols and cholesterol. They are released into the lymph and thereby enter the blood. They are not formed in the liver. Cholesterol is not needed for the formaiton of red cell membranes, these are other glycoproteins and cytoskeletal proteins.  VLDL to LDL transformation occurs in the blood stream."
basic medicine,1911,Which of the following is within the cavernous sinus?,The basilar artery,The external carotid artery,The facial nerve,The optic nerve,The trochlear nerve,E,"The cavernous sinus contains:  The internal carotid artery The occulomotor nerve The trochlear nerve The abducent nerve, and The upper two divisions of the trigeminal nerve - ophthalmic and maxillary nerves (the mandibular pasess later to the cavernous sinus, through the foramen ovale).  On the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus, from above downwards: occulomotor, trochlear, ophthalmic and maxillary nerves. The internal carotid artery passes through the lower, medial part of the cavernous sinus with the abducens nerve on its lateral border."
basic medicine,1912,"In the hand, which statement is correct?",Anterior dislocation of the lunate may compress the median nerve,Digital nerves lie on the dorsum of fingers,Opposition of the thumb tests the ulnar nerve,The deep branch of the ulnar nerve supplies all the lumbricals,The thenar eminence is supplied by the ulnar nerve,A,"The lateral two lumbricals are supplied by the median nerve, and the medial two are supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. The thenar muscles (abductor pollicis brevis, flexor pollicis brevis, opponens pollicis and adductor pollicis) are all supplied by the median nerve, with the exception of adductor pollicis, which is supplied by the deep branch of the ulnar nerve. Opposition of the thumb is therefore supplied by the median nerve. The digital nerves run alongside the fingers. Anterior dislocation of the lunate is a common injury occurring in the carpal bones, usually as a result of falling on an outstretched hand. Unless there is prompt reduction of the dislocation, median nerve injury may occur due to compression."
basic medicine,1913,"A 68-year-old man presents with a one month history of dyspnoea and a 3 kg weight loss. On examination there were signs of a large left pleural effusion, confirmed on chest x ray. Pleural fluid analysis revealed:    Protein 38 g/L   Cytology a few lymphocytes and red blood cells    Which one of the following investigations should be considered next?",Bronchoscopy,CT scan of thorax,Repeat pleural aspiration with biopsy,Thoracoscopic pleural biopsy,Tuberculin test,B,"The aspiration results here suggest this effusion is an exudate, which would fit with it being unilateral. The next most important step would be a contrast CT thorax which can help differentiate between benign and malignant disease and also guide further investigations. Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) can:  Ensure adequate pleural biopsies are obtained Drain pleural fluid, and Allow pleurodesis to prevent recurrence.  It should be considered after other non-invasive tests have proven negative. Usually the surgeons can do bronchoscopy at the same time under general anaesthetic. Percutaneous pleural biopsies do not produce good samples and are less often done. "
basic medicine,1914,Which one of the following occurs as a normal response to a major surgical operation?,Decreased lipolysis,Hypocalcaemia,Increased gluconeogenesis,Natriuresis,Potassium retention,C,"The response of the patient to surgical stress should be seen as an attempt to maintain a normal supply of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues of the body. Urine output is often diminished post operatively due to hypovolaemia a reduction in renal blood flow leading to resorption in sodium and water. Peri-operatively there is an increase in circulating adrenaline, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, cortisol and growth hormone which aggravate insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. These changes are proportional to the severity of the operation. They antagonise the actions of insulin and its secretion, resulting in catabolism with increased glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, proteolysis and lipolysis. In diabetes, the effects are compounded by insulin deficiency."
basic medicine,1915,All of the following are enzymes involved in glucose metabolism. Which is the target of the antibodies found in primary biliary cirrhosis?,Glucokinase (generates glucose-6-phosphate from glucose),Lactate dehydrogenase (generates lactate from pyruvate),Pyruvate dehydrogenase (generates acetyl-coA from pyruvate),Pyruvate kinase (generates pyruvate from phosphoenolpyruvate),All of the above,C,"Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PD), required for the generation of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate for entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is found in the mitochondria. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMAs), the serological hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), are often targeted against pyruvate dehydrogenase. The other enzymes listed are involved in glycolysis, which takes place in the cytosol. Pyruvate dehydrogenase is crucial for aerobic respiration. Inherited deficiencies/defects of PD are rare but often present with severe lactic acidosis in neonates. When this occurs, there can be no generation of acetyl-CoA for the Krebs cycle. Anaerobic glycolysis occurs, as the cell attempts to make adenosine triphosphate (ATP), but lactate is formed creating an acidosis. In health, PD competes with pyruvate carboxylase (PC) for their common substrate, pyruvate. PD produces acetyl-CoA for the Krebs cycle, whereas PC produces oxaloacetate, a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Acetyl-CoA regulates the balance between these two reactions (and thus the balance between anabolic and catabolic pathways) by activating PC - so that in 'energy-rich' states, where acetyl-CoA is in abundance, gluconeogenesis will be favoured.

basic medicine,1916,A 30-year-old woman with a strong family history of breast cancer is referred to the genetics service for counselling. What is the DNA repair mechanism by which the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins act?,Base excision repair,Double strand DNA break repair,Non-homologous end joining,Nucleotide excision repair,Single strand DNA break repair,B,"The BRCA proteins are involved in homologous recombination to repair DNA double strand breaks. Mutations in either of the genes encoding these proteins puts the patient at significantly higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancers, so that some women opt for prophylactic surgery to prevent this. Future treatment options with PARP inhibitors take advantage of this deficiency in DNA repair to kill cancer cells via synthetic lethality."

Which drug is the most likely to have caused this reaction?,Aspirin,Glyceryl trinitrate,Omeprazole,Paracetamol,Simvastatin,A,"The most likely cause of an urticarial eruption from this list would be aspirin. Other drugs frequently associated with urticaria include:  non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) penicillin angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors thiazides, and codeine.  "
basic medicine,1918,A 45 year old female who is currently on theophylline for poorly controlled asthma is commenced on treatment for a UTI. The next day she is suffering from nausea and vomiting. On examination she is tachycardic. What antibiotic is she likely to have been commenced on?,Co amoxiclav,Nitrofurantoin,Ciprofloxacin,Amoxicillin,Trimethoprim,C,"This patient is showing features of theophylline toxicity. Ciprofloxacin and other quinolones, macrolides, calcium channel blockers and other drugs can interact with theophylline and lead to increased plasma concentration, increasing toxicity."

basic medicine,1921,An otherwise healthy female is found to have a serum calcium of 2.89 mmol/l. She takes high doses of vitamins and minerals. What is the likely cause of the raised calcium?,Malignancy,Primary hyperparathyroidism,Normal variant,Excessive calcium intake,Excessive vitamin D intake,B,Excessive doses of vitamin D will result in a decrease in endogenous vitamin D production and is very unlikely to raise calcium levels. Calcium is actively absorbed by the intestine when levels are low and only passively absorbed when levels are high so calcium supplementation is unlikely. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of calcium and is often asymptomatic.
basic medicine,1922,Which of the following is true regarding the trachea?,Extends from the level of the fourth cervical vertebra to the carina,In an adult is approximately 15 cm long,Is made up of 12 C-shaped cartilaginous rings,Is the first of 25 generations of air passages,Receives its main blood supply from a branch of the external carotid artery,B,"The trachea of an adult is approximately 15 cm long, and it extends from the lower border of the cricoid cartilage at the level of the 6^th cervical vertebra. It terminates at the bronchial bifurcation or carina, which is between T4 and T6 (the variation is due to changes during breathing). The trachea has 16-20 C-shaped cartilaginous rings that maintain its patency. The tracheobronchial tree comprises 23 generations of air passages (not 25) from the trachea to the alveoli. The trachea is the first. The blood supply to the trachea is from the inferior thyroid arteries, which are branches of the thyrocervical trunk, which arise from the first part of the subclavian artery."
basic medicine,1923,"A 43-year-old woman presents with weight gain and menstrual irregularities. Her BMI is 29 kg/m^2, blood pressure is 150/90 mmHg and urinalysis shows + glucose. Which of the following investigations should be performed initially?",24 hour urine cortisol ,Aldosterone ,HbA1c ,Plasma testosterone ,Prolactin ,A,"This history is suggestive of Cushing's syndrome: hypertension, adiposity, menstrual irregularities and impaired glucose homeostasis or diabetes. It is caused by overproduction of cortisol. Other features are recurrent infections, osteoporosis, hypokalaemia and psychiatric disturbance. Cushing's syndrome can be challenging to diagnose as it often requires several different diagnostic tests. The 24 hour urine free cortisol (UFC) is a good initial screening test. Borderline results can occur with stress. If the UFC is elevated, consider repeating it and consider the overnight or low-dose dexamethasone suppression tests. Investigations are then often needed to localise the cause of Cushing's syndrome. If Cushing's syndrome is excluded, serum prolactin, testosterone and HbA1c are all reasonable tests to do. The patient may have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. The presence of clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism is useful in the diagnosis of PCOS - serum testosterone would be useful here. A prolactinoma can cause menstrual disturbance but is not particularly associated with weight gain or diabetes. The correct answer remains UFC however, as you do not want to miss Cushing's syndrome."
basic medicine,1924,Which of the following is correct regarding histamine H2 receptors?,Activation results in decreased intracellular cAMP,Are absent on the parietal cell,Are activated by gastrin,Are inhibited by omeprazole,Are involved in gastric acid secretion,E,"H2 receptors mediate gastric acid secretion and are also present in human heart, blood vessels, uterus and the brain, although their exact function is not clearly defined. The H2 receptors in the stomach are situated on the basolateral aspect of the parietal cell. The receptor complex spans the cell membrane and contains an adenylcyclase enzyme (without the need for a linked transmembrane protein). When the receptor is activated by histamine (not gastrin) the net result is an increase in intracellular cAMP which stimulates acid secretion and release from the parietal cell. Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor and as the name suggests specifically inhibits the proton pump."
basic medicine,1925,A 35-year-old woman develops an erythematous rash over her left nipple after breast feeding her child. It is not painful but has not resolved with multiple courses of antibiotics. She has noted some recent nipple inversion. What is the best investigation?,"CT chest, abdomen and pelvis",Mammogram,MRI of breast,Skin biopsy,Ultrasound of breast,D,"This is Paget's disease of the breast. It presents insidiously and is similar in appearance to eczema; as such it often goes undiagnosed for several months. Most cases are associated with invasive breast cancer, or ductal carcinoma in situ. Malignant cells infiltrate into the epidermis via the mammary duct epithelium, leading to thickening of the affected skin. Skin biopsy with immunohistochemistry is the first line investigation. Investigations should also be done for underlying malignancy - biopsy if a lump is palpable, imaging if no lump is palpable. Management is usually surgical with post-operative radiotherapy being offered to young patients with a high chance of recurrence."

basic medicine,1935,A 27-year-old woman undergoes excision of a lipoma on the day list and is surprised how quickly the wound heals. Which cell type is involved almost immediately in wound healing following tissue injury?,Basophils,Fibroblasts,Macrophages,Monocytes,Platelets,E,Damage to blood vessel walls during tissue injury leads to the rapid formation of a platelet plug to prevent bleeding. Vasodilation and increased vascular permeability is then followed by the influx of inflammatory cells and fibroblasts. Neutrophils initiate phagocytosis and are the predominant cell type in the first 24 hours. Macrophages secrete cytokines and continue phagocytosis as they become the predominant cell type after 48 hours.

basic medicine,1939,A 59-year-old lifelong smoker presents to her GP complaining of increasing shortness of breath and has noticed ptosis and constriction of her right pupil. She is referred by her GP for a chest x ray that is reported as showing a right apical mass. Biopsy confirms a malignant tumour. What is the eponymous diagnosis?,Horner's syndrome,Pancoast's tumour,Peyronie's disease,Pott's cancer,Wilms' tumour,B,"This lady has almost certainly got a Pancoast's tumour (first described by Henry Pancoast, an American radiologist, in 1924). It is a neoplasm of the apex of the lung that typically invades the chest wall and brachial plexus. The ptosis and constriction of her pupil is suggestive of a Horner's syndrome but this is a consequence of her Pancoast's tumour (ususally a non-small cell carcinoma). Other structures an apical tumour (superior sulcus tumour) may locally invade or compress are:  phrenic nerve vagus nerve suclavian vein and artery brachiocepalic vein (superior vena caval syndrome), and brachial plexus.  Peyronie's disease is hardening of the corpora cavernosa of the penis caused by scar tissue. Pott's cancer is a scrotal cancer (of historical interest) caused by coal tar exposure. A Wilms' tumour is a malignant tumour of the kidney that usually occurs in childhood."

Smooth endoplasmic reticulum is a site of lipid synthesis within the cell. Lysosomes (lysis- breakage, soma- body) contain digestive enzymes which break down expendable cell organelles, engulfed viruses and other intracellular detritus. Peroxisomes are responsible for the metabolism of fatty acids within cells."
basic medicine,1942,Which of the following agents is correctly paired with the named tumour?,Aflatoxins: liver cell carcinoma,Androgenic steroids: vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma,Asbestos: hepatic angiosarcoma,Beta-naphthylamine: bronchial carcinoma,Vinyl chloride: peritoneal mesothelioma,A,Aflatoxins are a product of moulds and eating foods contaminated with aflatoxin increases the risk of hepatoma. Anabolic androgenic steroids such as nandrolone/stanazolol may cause hepatic tumours. Diethylstilboestrol exposure in utero is associated with the later development of vaginal clear cell carcinoma. Mesiothelioma is perishingly rare and prior exposure to asbestos is the culpable agent even in the peritoneum. Beta naphthylamine exposure increases the risk of bladder cancers. Vinyl chloride is implicated in the development of the rare tumour angiosarcoma of the liver.

basic medicine,1944,"When blood passes through systemic capillaries, which of the following is correct?",Bicarbonate ions pass from the red cells to the plasma,Its oxygen dissociation curve shifts to the left,The concentration of chloride ions in the red cells falls,The pH increases,The velocity of blood flow is greater than in the aorta,A,"CO2 diffuses into plasma and the red blood cells (RBCs); HCO3^- is formed faster in the RBCs because of carbonic anhydrase and therefore HCO3^- moves out of the cells into the plasma. The rise in CO2 shifts the curve to the right (Bohr effect), that is, with an increased PCO2 haemoglobin has a diminished ability to bind O2 and therefore gives it up to the tissue more readily. Increasing temperature and a decrease in pH will also cause a rightward shift in the curve. Even though the volume must be the same as that in the aorta, the flow must be lower because the total cross sectional area is greater."

basic medicine,1946,"A 65-year-old woman is seen in the oncology clinic following a diagnosis of a grade 3, 14 mm invasive breast cancer with no vascular invasion. 0 of 4 axillary lymph nodes were involved and excision margins were complete. Staining for oestrogen receptors and progesterone receptors is strongly positive, HER-2 staining is negative. She is considered for adjuvant chemotherapy and hormone treatments. Which of the following endocrine agents would be prescribed for this patient?",Anastrozole,Exemestane,Fulvestrant,Tamoxifen,Trastuzumab,A,"Hormonal treatment is used to remove the proliferative stimulus of oestrogen from tumour cells. In the UK tamoxifen for 5 years was the standard adjuvant hormonal treatment for postmenopausal women with early oestrogen-receptor-positive breast carcinoma. Tamoxifen acts by blocking the binding of oestrogen to its receptor within the nucleus. However, long-term use is associated with vaginal bleeding, endometrial thickening and increased risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolism. More recently aromatase inhibitors have been developed. These block the production of oestrogen from androgens in peripheral tissues, such as muscle and fat, which continues in post-menopausal women. Three such drugs are licensed for treatment of early oestrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer, as in this case. These are anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. A common side-effect is reduced bone mineral density, and bone densitometry is therefore often carried out prior to and during treatment. Anastrozole is currently indicated for early oestrogen-receptor-positive breast carcinoma at a dose of 1 mg daily for 5 years. It can also be used in advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Exemestane is licensed for women with oestrogen-receptor-positive invasive early breast carcinoma who have already received 2-3 years of tamoxifen, and those who have evidence of disease progression despite oestrogen therapy. Trastuzumab can be used for early and late breast cancer but in HER-2 positive patients. Randomised controlled trials have shown that, relative to tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors improve clinical outcomes. Anastrozole is therefore now first-line for primary hormonal adjuvant therapy in early oestrogen-receptor-positive invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Fulvestrant is a new pure anti-oestrogen agent which appears to be as effective as anastrozole; it is given by sub-cutaneous injection once every three weeks. NICE does not currently recommend its use for postmenopausal women ahead of aromatase inhibitors. "

It begins at the cricoid cartilage (C6), passes through the diaphragm at T10 level and ends in the stomach at T11 level. It is 25 centimetres long. (The incisor to gastro-oesophageal junction length is 40 cm and not the length of the oesophagus). It is lined by stratified squamous epithelium in its upper two thirds and stratified columnar epithelium in its lower third. The normal indentations on the oesophagus are from the aortic arch, left bronchus and the diaphragm. It is narrowest at its origin. It is supplied by:  The inferior thyroid arteries in the neck Branches of bronchial arteries and aorta in the thorax, and Branches from the left gastric artery.  The venous drainage similarly is also distributed:  To the brachiocephalic veins in the neck Azygos system in the thorax, and The lower end drains into the portal system through the cardiac and left gastric veins.  The nerve supply is from the recurrent laryngeal nerves and the middle cervical sympathetic ganglion for the upper third of the oesophagus. The middle and lower third receive parasympathetic supply from the vagus and sympathetic supply from the thoracic sympathetic chain.  The cervical oesophagus drains into the deep cervical nodes Thoracic oesophagus drains into tracheo-bronchial and posterior mediastinal nodes, and The abdominal oesophagus drains into the gastric and celiac nodes.  However, the lymphatics traverse long distances within the wall of the oesophagus before draining. This is said to be the reason for synchronous or metachronous lesions seen in oesophageal cancer."

Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient?",ACTH stimulation test,Activated protein C,Change of inotropes,Hydrocortisone,Nitric oxide,D,"The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (a partnership of the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, and the International Sepsis Forum) has teamed up with the Institute for Healthcare Improvement to develop severe sepsis bundles. A 'bundle' is a group of interventions related to a disease process that, when executed together, result in better outcomes than when implemented individually. Sepsis Resuscitation Bundle: Should begin immediately, but must be accomplished within the first six hours of presentation.  Serum lactate measured. Blood cultures obtained prior to antibiotic administration. From the time of presentation, broad-spectrum antibiotics administered within three hours for ED admissions and one hour for non-ED ICU admissions. In the event of hypotension and/or lactate greater than 4 mmol/l (36 mg/dl):  Deliver an initial minimum of 30 ml/kg of crystalloid (or colloid equivalent). Apply vasopressors for hypotension not responding to initial fluid resuscitation to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) greater than 65 mm Hg.   In the event of persistent hypotension despite fluid resuscitation (septic shock) and/or lactate greater than 4 mmol/l (36 mg/dl):  Achieve central venous pressure (CVP) of greater than 8 mm Hg. Achieve central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) of greater than 70%.    Sepsis Management Bundle: To be accomplished as soon as possible may be completed within twenty-four hours of presentation.  Steroids administered for septic shock in accordance with a standardised ICU policy. ACTH stimulation test not required prior to this. Glucose control maintained greater than lower limit of normal, but less than 150 mg/dl (8.3 mmol/l). Inspiratory plateau pressures maintained less than 30 cm H2O for mechanically ventilated patients.  Drotrectogin alpha (activated protein C) used to be recommended by NICE for the treatment of severe sepsis. However, in October 2011 the company withdrew this from the market following the results of the PROWESS-SHOCK study, which showed there was no statistically significant reduction in 28-day all-cause mortality in patients with septic shock. Nitric oxide is a non-proven therapy in adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but is less likely to be effective in this situation. "

Which of the following is this patient more likely to develop than a slow acetylator?,None of these,Nausea,Treatment failure,Peripheral Neuropathy,Hepatotoxicity,A,Previously it was thought that fast acetylators led to increased heptotoxicity due to the increased production of acetylhydrazine which was thought to be the metabolite responsible for hepatotoxicity. However more recent studies suggests that it is slow acetylators who are at increased risk as there is increased accumulation of toxic metabolites such as hydrazine which is now thought to be the metabolite responsible for isoniazid induced hepatoxicity. Acetylation status is genetically determined and is not thought to significantly affect effectiveness of the drug.

basic medicine,1980,Which of the following is true of gangrene?,"In the affected part, sensation and venous return is usually preserved",Is a form of apoptosis,"Is always diagnosed by the brown, greenish black or black appearance",It is advisable to convert dry gangrene into a moist type,With arterial insufficiency is usually dry,E,"Gangrene is not a form of apoptosis (which is programmed cell death) and it implies death with putrefaction of macroscopic portions of the tissue. A gangrenous part lacks arterial pulsation, venous return, sensation, warmth and function. The colour of the part changes through a variety of shades according to circumstances (pallor, dusky red, mottled, purple) until finally taking on the characteristic dark brown, greenish black or black appearance, which is due to the disintegration of haemoglobin and the formation of iron sulphide. Dry gangrene occurs when the tissues are desiccated by gradual slowing of the bloodstream; it is typically the result of atherosclerosis. Moist gangrene occurs when venous as well as arterial obstruction is present, when the artery is suddenly occluded, as by a ligature or embolus, and in diabetes. In moist gangrene, infection and putrefaction are more severe, the affected part becomes swollen and discoloured, and the epidermis may be raised in blebs. The final line of demarcation in moist gangrene becomes more proximal than in dry gangrene and hence dry gangrene should be kept as dry and aseptic as possible. In addition, every effort should be made to convert a moist into a dry type."
basic medicine,1981,Which is true in exercise?,An increase in muscle blood flow begins after the first half minute of exercise,Body temperature may rise measurably,Cerebral blood flow increases if the exercise causes systolic arterial blood pressure to rise,Lymph flow from the exercising muscles decreases,Visceral blood flow increases,B,"Exercise produces an increase in heart rate, blood pressure and muscle blood flow (after at least a minute). Cerebral blood flow is, however, very closely controlled and is generally stable. It increases in response to increased CO2. Capillary pressure and surface area are increased therefore more fluid leaves the bloodstream. Muscle action assists the movement of lymph. Visceral blood flow decreases due to sympathetic increased activity with the diversion of blood to the exercising muscles."

Of the following, which is the likely diagnosis?",Air embolism,Anaphylaxis,Circulatory overload,Hyperkalaemia,Thrombophlebitis,C,In elderly patients fluid overload is a potential complication following a transfusion. Furosemide may be given in these cases to reduce the risk. Transfusion has associated risks and absolute values of haemoglobin are not fully defined. Hb concentrations of less than8 g/dL are generally accepted for fit patients and less than10 g/dL for those with ischaemic heart disease. 
basic medicine,1986,Which one of the following statements concerning the posteroanterior (PA) chest x ray is correct?,Bowel interposed between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm is abnormal,Rotation of the patient causes the lungs to have a difference in translucency,The left hemidiaphragm is usually about 2 cm higher than the right,The pulmonary vessels behind the heart are almost never visualised,The x ray is taken at full expiration in a normal patient,B,"The PA chest x ray is performed in the radiology department and is a high quality radiograph which differs from the portable anteroposterior (AP) chest x ray which is of inferior quality. The technique of taking a PA chest x ray involves a patient standing with their back to the x ray source, with the anterior chest wall against the film plate. It should ideally be taken at full inspiration, otherwise the appearance of abnormal lung base shadowing and cardiac enlargement may be seen. When the x ray penetration is sufficient the thoracic vertebrae can be visualised on the radiograph, which ensures that the pulmonary vessels behind the heart are well seen. In an adequately centred x ray the medial ends of the clavicles should be equidistant from the spinous processes in the midline of the thoracic spine. If the patient is rotated then it can cause the lungs to have a difference in translucency, which can mimic pulmonary disease. The hilum and heart may also look enlarged. Normally the right hemidiaphragm is higher than the left by 1.5-2 cm and a difference of more than 3 cm may be significant. In hyperinflation they may be at the same level and when the stomach or splenic flexure is distended the left hemidiaphragm may be higher than the right. As a normal variant, bowel may be interposed between the liver and the right hemidiaphragm; this is known as Chilaiditi's syndrome."
basic medicine,1987,"In case of any injury, the earliest phase of wound healing platelets are held together by?",Type 2 Collagen,Type 1 Collagen,Fibroclasts,Fibrin,PGE2,D,"The clotting cascade is activated by tissue factor and endothelial cells resulting in activation of platelets during the 1st stage of wound healing which is haemostasis. Even in small incised wounds a small haematoma develop. This results in platelet aggregation and the laying down of a fibrin mesh that is cross linked and holds the platelets in place.Wound healing is typically divided into four phases. The four phases of wound healing are:Hemostasis Phase: This is the initial phase that starts immediately after the injury occurs. The body's response involves vasoconstriction and the formation of a blood clot .Inflammatory Phase: Following hemostasis, the inflammatory phase begins and can last for several days. During this phase, the body triggers an inflammatory response to remove debris, foreign substances, and bacteria from the wound. Immune cells, growth factors, and other chemicals are released to initiate the healing process.Proliferative Phase: After the inflammatory phase, the proliferative phase starts, lasting for several weeks. New tissue is formed through the action of fibroblasts, which produce collagen, and other cells. The wound is filled with granulation tissue, which contains new blood vessels and collagen.Remodeling Phase: The final phase of wound healing is the remodeling phase. It can last for several months to years after the injury. During this phase, the collagen fibers reorganize and gain strength, and the wound contracts and becomes smaller. The goal is to improve the wound's tensile strength and functionality, although it may not reach the original strength of the uninjured tissue entirely.Tissue FactorThere are two ways to activate the clotting cascade : 1-Damaged endothelium Intrinsic pathway 2-Tissue Factor Extrinsic pathway"
basic medicine,1988,Which of the following are found in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells?,Chromosomes,Introns,Linear DNA,Nuclear membrane,Ribosomes,E,"Eukaryotes (higher organisms) have muliple chromosomes in the genome, which is separated from the rest of the cell by nuclear membranes. Prokaryotes lack a membrane bound nucleus, and their DNA occurs in a circular form. Transcription of eukaryotic genes requires non-coding sequences (introns) in the mRNA to be spliced out before translation at the ribosome. Both eukaryotes and prokaryotes have a ribosome, though the ribosome is significantly larger in eukaryotes. "
basic medicine,1989,"A 25-year-old woman presents with oligomenorrhoea. On examination she has a large pelvic mass and is referred for further investigation. Prior to a planned biopsy of her pelvic mass, she complains of a dry cough. A subsequent chest x ray reveals multiple rounded opacities throughout both lung fields. What is the best test for monitoring her condition after optimal treatment?",Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP),CA-125,None,Regular abdominal ultrasound,Regular pelvic examination,A,"Patients with germ cell tumours are usually young and present in a variety of ways. The diagnosis is usually made on biopsy in the case of ovarian tumours and treatment usually consists of surgery followed by chemotherapy (BEP). The fact that this lady is young, and has early pulmonary metastases, make a germ cell tumour much more likely. Epithelial cell tumours usually disseminate through the abdomen and peritoneum prior to metastasising to the lungs. Markers such as AFP, β-human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) may be raised but the most sensitive marker used for monitoring treatment efficacy and risk of relapse is AFP. CA-125 is usually used for monitoring and screening in ovarian cancer.  Regular pelvic examination and ultrasound may misk microscopic cells still secreting AFP and is a more subjective modality than blood testing."
basic medicine,1990,Which of the following is true regarding burning pain sensation?,Arises from stimulation of Golgi organs,Is reduced by local anaesthetics through reduction of the potassium influx into the nerve fibres,Is transmitted to the brain via the corticospinal tracts,Is transmitted to the central nervous system (CNS) by Aδ fibres,Is transmitted to the thalamus,E,"The sense organs for pain are the naked nerve endings found in almost every tissue of the body. Pain impulses are transmitted to the CNS by two fibre systems, which are myelinated AƒÔ fibres and unmyelinated C fibres. The A delta fibres (Aδ fibre) conduct cold and pressure impulses. The pain sensation is transmitted to the brain through the lateral spinothalamic tracts. Local anaesthetics reduce the pain sensation by inhibiting the fast Na+ response. Many fibres activated by pain end in the reticular system, which projects to the midline and intralaminar non-specific projection nuclei of the thalamus."
basic medicine,1991,"You have taken a history from a patient with symptoms of urinary incontinence. There is no history of cancer, no suggestion of neurological disease and no pelvic masses. According to NICE guidelines which of the tests below is indicated in the initial assessment of patients with urinary incontinence?",Videourodynamics,Ambulatory urodynamics,Multi-channel cystometry,Post void residual volume by bladder scan,Cystoscopy,D,"The 2013 NICE guidance replaces Greentop guideline 35 regarding the assessment of urinary incontinence. The initial tests should include:History and examination including digital assessment of pelvic floor muscles Urine dipstick testing Post void residual volume (preference by ultrasound) Bladder diaries for 3 daysCystoscopy alone and Imaging (CT/MRI/XRAY) are not indicated in the initial assessment.Urodynamics (multi-channel filling and voiding cystometry) are indicated before surgery in women who have:symptoms of OAB leading to a clinical suspicion of detrusor overactivity, or symptoms suggestive of voiding dysfunctionor anterior compartment prolapseor had previous surgery for stress incontinence"
basic medicine,1992,Which of the following chemotherapeutic agents inhibits topoisomerase?,Bleomycin,Cisplatin,Docetaxel,Etoposide,Vincristine,D,"The topoisomerase inhibitors are a major class of chemotherapeutic agents and work by arresting the cell in S phase, and thereby inducing apoptosis. Etoposide inhibits DNA topoisomerase II, thereby inducing errors in DNA synthesis at the pre-mitotic stage of cell division. Bleomycin binds directly to DNA, inducing strand breaks and therefore degradation. Cisplatin cross-links DNA, activating several signal transduction pathways which culminate in cell apoptosis. Docetaxel prevents microtubule disassembly, and therefore limits the amount of free tubulin available for cell replication. Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid, which inhibits microtubule formation during metaphase of mitosis."
basic medicine,1993,A young woman has acne and is taking oral medication. She develops polyarthritis and has raised liver enzyme tests. Investigations show:    AST 95 U/L (1-31)   ALT 170 U/L (5-35)   Bilirubin 16 µmol/L (1-22)   Antinuclear antibodies Strongly positive at 1/20   Negative at 1/640    Which of the following drugs is she most likely to have been prescribed?,Erythromycin,Isotretinoin,Minocycline,Oxytetracycline,Trimethoprim,C,"All other drugs listed above can be used in the treatment of acne. All of these can cause hepatotoxicity, and therefore raised alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Minocycline is the only drug listed which can account for the polyarthritis and antinuclear antibody (ANA), due to its ability to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus. Classically, drug-induced lupus erythematosus is characterised by  Systemic disease with a lower incidence of nephritis Lack of cutaneous involvement and The presence of antihistone antibodies^1.  The most commonly associated drugs have historically been procainamide and hydralazine 2, although their use is now decreasing. Medications associated more recently include the anti-TNF alpha agents, statins and minocycline. Minocycline is unusual in that it seems to be associated with the development of long term immunological memory, and therefore exacerbation of symptoms within 12-24 hours of rechallenge^2. Minocycline has been well documented as a cause of drug-induced systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Characteristically, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C reactive protein (CRP) are both markedly elevated, the ANA is strongly positive and there is a hypergammaglobulinaemia. Anti-dsDNA antibodies are usually negative; antihistone antibodies are positive in 95% of drug-induced lupus (but also 50-80% of idiopathic SLE3). A strongly positive ANA is a risk factor for developing drug-induced lupus, but a negative ANA would not exclude the diagnosis^2. Drug-induced lupus is defined as a lupus-like syndrome temporally related to continuous drug exposure which resolves after discontinuation of the offending drug^4. There are several features which distinguish drug-induced lupus from idiopathic SLE:  Males and females are equally affected in drug-induced lupus, whereas idiopathic SLE affects females nine times more frequently^3. Caucasians are affected by drug-induced lupus more commonly than Afro-Caribbeans, whereas the inverse is true of idiopathic SLE. In addition, the age of onset is typically older in drug-induced lupus, but this depends on the age at drug exposure. Fever, arthralgia, serositis and ANA occur at least as frequently in drug-induced lupus as idiopathic SLE. Haematological, renal and central nervous system (CNS) involvement, and double-stranded DNA autoantibodies are rare^3.  The pathogenesis of drug-induced lupus is unclear. Factors that influence drug metabolism, such as acetylator status, have been implicated. In addition, lupus-inducing drugs have been shown to generate a variety of cytotoxic products on exposure to MPO released from activated neutrophils^2. The time taken for symptoms to resolve after stopping minocycline is highly variable, from a few days to two years^3. Typically, no further treatment is required but there are situations where corticosteroids or disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are required to aid resolution^3. "
basic medicine,1994,"A 65-year-old woman presents to the oncology clinic with a two month history of cough and haemoptysis. A suspicious lesion on a recent chest x ray was biopsied and confirms a bronchogenic adenocarcinoma. Currently the patient is short of breath causing her to be in bed for about three hours every day. She can manage the stairs but is markedly breathless when she reaches the top. She is currently unable to work. Her husband helps around the house but she does not need help with her activities of daily living.

basic medicine,1995,Which of the following is true regarding directional airflow in theatre?,May be vertical or horizontal,Produces turbulent airflow,Produces 20-40 air changes per minute,The air is pumped in through filters and out of vents in the periphery of theatre,Work with the aid of negative pressure,D,"The correct answer is that the air is pumped in through filters and out of vents in the periphery of theatre, producing flow in a clean to dirty direction. The directional (laminar) airflow is in addition to the normal turbulent airflow in theatre which maintains humidity and temperature. This directional airflow produces non-turbulent flow. Most theatres have 20-40 air changes per hour, as opposed to 20-40 air changes per minute. This increased rate of air change is necessary to reduce the number of contaminated particles over the patient. The directional airflow in theatre works with positive pressure as air is pumped into theatre through filters."

basic medicine,1997,Which of the following is true regarding patients with anaemia?,Each haemoglobin molecule has the potential to combine with eight molecules of oxygen to become fully saturated,Oxygen delivery to tissues does not appear to fall until the haemoglobin level falls below 50 g/L,Oxygen extraction is improved by a shift in the oxyhaemoglobin curve to the left,There appears to be a decreased risk of tumour recurrence in patients who require transfusion,"Treated with ferrous sulphate (200 mg tds), patients should see a rise in haemoglobin levels of 1 g/L/week after two weeks in iron deficiency anaemia",E,Each Hb molecule has a binding site for four molecules of oxygen. The critical level at which oxygen delivery is affected by anaemia is approximately 80 g/L. Oxygen retention by the Hb molecule is increased through a shift to the left of the oxygen dissociation curve. In anaemia the curve is shifted to the right. For a given partial pressure of oxygen there are fewer O2 molecules associated with haemoglobin. This means there is less saturation: the decreased affinity for O2 molecules increases oxygen delivery to the tissues. A small but significant risk of tumour relapse exists in those subjects that require transfusion. This may be due to the advanced nature of their tumour (increased metabolic and inflammatory processes associated with greater dissemination). In iron deficiency anaemia a rapid improvement in Hb may be expected with appropriate iron supplementation.
basic medicine,1998,Which of the following is correct regarding the temperomandibular joint (TMJ)?,Has the chorda tympani as the anterior relationship,Has the tendon of the medial pterygoid muscle attached to the joint capsule and the neck of the mandible,Is a ball and socket joint,Is most stable with the teeth occluded,Is supplied by the facial nerve,D,"The TMJ is synovial. The articular disc divides the joint into upper and lower cavities. The chorda tympani nerve, a branch of CN VII, is found posterior to the TMJ. The capsule is attached in front to the tendon of the lateral pterygoid muscle and by fibrous bands to the head of the mandible. These bands ensure the disc moves forward and backward with the head of the mandible during protraction and retraction of the mandible. The TMJ is supplied by the auriculotemporal and masseteric branches of the mandibular nerve. Dislocation mainly occurs when the mandible is depressed."
basic medicine,1999,A 62-year-old man with non-small cell lung cancer is being considered for surgical resection. Which of the following would be regarded as a contraindication to surgery?,FEV1 1.2 L,Horner's syndrome,Hypercalcaemia,Peripheral neuropathy,Previous history of myocardial infarction,A,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a heterogeneous aggregate of at least three distinct histologies of lung cancer including epidermoid or squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma. These histologies are often classified together because, when localised, all have the potential for cure with surgical resection. Assessing fitness for surgery in cases of lung carcinoma can be difficult, and requires consideration of a number of factors. Lung function needs to be assessed prior to referral to the thoracic surgical team. A post-bronchodilator FEV1 of greater than1.5 litres is sufficient if a lobectomy is all that is required. If the tumour necessitates a pneumonectomy, the post-bronchodilator FEV should be more than 2 litres. Below these values, further investigation in the form of estimation of transfer factor, oxygen saturations at rest and quantitative isotope perfusion should be undertaken. These values can be used to calculate estimated postoperative FEV1 and postoperative transfer factor. Patients with an estimated postoperative FEV1 less than 40% predicted, transfer factor more than 40% predicted and oxygen saturations of more than 90% on air are considered to be average risk. Those with an FEV1 and transfer factor of less than 40% are thought to be high risk. All other combinations are indications for exercise testing (shuttle walk tests or formal cardiopulmonary exercise tests). High-risk patients identified by this step-wise testing should be discussed at a formal multidisciplinary meeting, and should be considered for more limited resection or non-surgical management. Perioperative morbidity increases with advancing age, and more elderly patients typically require more intensive perioperative support. However, surgery for clinically stage I and II disease can be as effective in patients over the age of 70 and should be considered regardless of age. Age over 80 alone is not a contraindication to lobectomy or wedge resection for stage I disease, but may be a contraindication to pneumonectomy and each case should be assessed individually. Cardiovascular fitness should be assessed with a preoperative ECG. Those with an audible murmur should have an echocardiogram. A recent MI (within 6 months) is an indication for cardiology opinion prior to surgery, but not an absolute contraindication. In general, surgery should be delayed until 6 weeks following myocardial infarct if possible. All patients with a history of previous stroke, transient ischaemic attacks, or carotid bruits should be assessed with carotid Doppler studies. Those with significant stenosis should be assessed by a vascular surgeon or stroke physician. Patients presenting with preoperative weight loss of more than 10% and/or performance status of WHO 2 or worse should have their BMI and albumin measured, and metastatic disease carefully excluded. Patients who are anatomically suited to resection but have more than one adverse medical factor should have their management discussed formally at a multidisciplinary meeting. In addition to the above patient factors, there are characteristics of the tumour which will help determine operability. All patients being considered for surgery should have a plain chest radiograph and CT scan of the thorax, liver and adrenal glands. Confirmatory percutaneous biopsy in patients presenting with peripheral lesions is not mandatory, particularly if the lesion was not present on previous chest radiographs. Patients with mediastinal nodes greater than 1 cm in diameter on CT should undergo biopsy. Patients with stage I (cT1N0 and cT2N0) and stage II (cT1N1, cT2N1 and cT3N0) tumours should be considered operable. Patients with stage IIIA (cT3N1 and cT1-3N2) tumours have a low change of being cured by surgery alone, but it can be used in the context of a trial in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy. Stage IIIB and IV tumours should generally be considered inoperable. Whilst most pleural effusions associated with lung carcinoma are due to the tumour (and results in classification as a T4 tumour), in some patients cytological examination of the fluid is negative. If this is confirmed on more than one occasion, and clinical judgement dictates that the effusion is not related to the tumour, the effusion should be excluded as a staging element. This may mean they are suitable for surgery. Whilst in most cases the presence of a Horner's syndrome indicates extrapulmonary spread, it may be caused by external compression. It is therefore not an immediate absolute contraindication to surgery - it indicates the need for further investigation. Hypercalcaemia and peripheral neuropathy may be paraneoplastic phenomena and are not of themselves contraindications to surgery. Nor would a previous myocardial infarction be a contraindication to surgery. "
basic medicine,2000,A patient has recently underwent a liver transplant and is found to have hyperkalaemia. He is on anti rejection drugs but is otherwise well and is on no other medications. What is the most likely cause of his hyperkalaemia?,Ciclosporin,NSAIDs,Ramipril,None of these,Tacrolimus,E,"Tacrolimus is used post liver transplant as the the anti rejection drug of choice. It has been shown to be superior to ciclosporin although may be associated with higher rates of diabetes. Tacrolimus is nephrotoxic and although may cause hyperkalaemia due to renal failure it can also lead to hyperkalaemia due to the fact it suppresses renin release, decreasing aldosterone synthesis and therefore reducing potassium secretion in collecting duct. Ciclosporin can lead to hyperkalaemia through similar mechanisms."
basic medicine,2001,Which of the following is true regarding the thyroid gland?,Develops from the endoderm between the second and third pharyngeal pouches,Has C cells that are derived from the ultimobranchial body,Is at the level of the third to fifth cervical vertebrae,May have accessory nodules in the hyoid,Usually weighs about 100 g,B,The thyroid gland develops from the first and second pharyngeal pouches. The C cells are responsible for the secretion of calcitonin. Accessory nodules are well recognised in the base of the tongue. It ususally weighs about 25 g.
basic medicine,2002,Which of the following is true with reference to capillaries?,Capillaries in the dermis actively constrict in response to sympathetic stimulation,Cerebral capillaries have microscopically visible 'leaks',Fenestrations are not present in the renal glomerular capillaries,The diameter of a capillary in skeletal muscle is usually about twice the diameter of a red blood cell,"When skeletal muscle is active, more capillaries are open than when it is at rest",E,Capillaries link the arterioles and venules and are involved in the delivery of blood to the cells themselves. Therefore capillaries permit the leakage of plasma through fenestrations. The ability of blood to flow through these capillaries is closely controlled by arteriolar tone. They do not have smooth muscle themselves. Hence exercise can stimulate greater opening up of the capillary beds. The diameter of a capillary is 5-10 microns. Erythrocyte diameter is 6-8 microns.

basic medicine,2006,Which of the following is correct regarding the adrenal glands?,Cortices contain chromaffin cells,Lie posteriorly to the diaphragm,Lymphatic drainage is to the superficial inguinal nodes,Medulla is derived from mesoderm,On the left lies behind the pancreas,E,"The adrenal glands are contained within the same membrane as the kidney but separated from them by a fibrous layer of tissue. The right gland is tetrahedral in shape and lies lower than the left, which is semilunar in shape and usually the larger of the two. Each gland weighs approximately 5 grams and measures approximately 50 mm vertically, 30 mm across and 10 mm thick. The right lies between the diaphragm posteriorly and the IVC anteromedially. Superiorly lies the bare area of the liver. Its inferior end is covered by peritoneum reflected over it from the liver. The left lies in the stomach bed, with anterior relations of the stomach and pancreas and posteriorly with the diaphragm. Its inferior part is not covered by peritoneum as it is crossed anteriorly by the tail of the pancreas and splenic vessels. The adrenal medulla contains the chromaffin cells. Embryologically the medulla is derived from neural crest cells and cortex from mesoderm."

Breast milk jaundice is a benign self limiting condition causing unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia; biliary atresia causes prolonged obstructive jaundice. If the isotope passes from the liver into the duodenum the bile ducts would be patent, unlike in biliary atresia.

basic medicine,2013,Which of the following is true regarding the APACHE II scoring system?,Involves the assessment of 12 physiological measurements,Is a widely used method of evaluating the condition of a neonate,Points are awarded as the age increases above 50 years,Systolic blood pressure and heart rate are cardiovascular measurements which are included in the physiological assessment,The Glasgow coma score is added to the physiology score,A,"The APACHE scoring system (Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation) is used on ICU to assess the severity of illness in individual patients, which allows stratification of patient groups in order to compare different therapies. APACHE scores may be weighted according to illness to give a mortality prediction for a specific patient. The APGAR scoring system is used to evaluate the condition of newly born neonates. In 1981 the APACHE I system was introduced, and then in 1985 this was replaced by the APACHE II system. The APACHE II score is the sum of the acute physiology score (APS), the numerical assessment of chronic health and the points allocated for increasing age. The acute physiology score:  This assesses 12 physiological variables, with each being awarded points from 0 to 4 depending on their deviation from the normal range. The greater the deviation the greater number of points allocated. The sum of these 12 variables is then added to a numerical assessment of neurological function (15 minus the Glasgow coma score), which is the 12^th variable, to make up the APS. The variables are: PaO2 rectal temperature; MAP; Arterial pH; heart rate; respiratory rate; Na^+; K^+; Creatinine; haematocrit; WBC; Glasgow coma score.  Therefore, the APACHE II score assesses 12 physiological variables (the APACHE I assesses 34). Points are assigned to age in the following manner    Years Points   less than44 0   45-54 2   55-64 3   65-74 5   greater than75 6    Note that points are allocated at the age of 45 years or above (not 50 years). Chronic health points are awarded for:  Organ insufficiency (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal and hepatic), or Immunosuppression (pharmacological, radiation and disease states, for example, lymphoma, AIDS)  which were documented prior to the present hospital admission. The points assigned are greater for non-operative or emergency postoperative patients than for elective postoperative patients. The mean arterial pressure (not systolic) and heart rate are the cardiovascular measurements included in the physiological assessment of the APS."

basic medicine,2015,How is the majority of cortisol metabolised and excreted from the body?,Metabolised in liver and excreted in bile acids as free cortisol,Metabolised in liver and excreted in bile acids as conjugated metabolites,Metabolised in liver and excreted in the urine as cortisol,Hepatic metabolism,"Metabolised in liver, metabolites conjugated and excreted in the urine",E,Cortisol and cortisone are mainly metabolised in the liver. These reduced metabolites are then conjugated to glucuronides which are excreted in the urine. A small fraction of cortisol is excreted unmetabolised and unconjugated in the urine. Free urinary cortisol and the metabolites are therefore increased in cushings syndrome and therefore free urinary cortisol is useful in the diagnosis.

basic medicine,2017,Which one of the above mechanisms is important in controlling blood loss from the uterus during the third stage of labour?,Increased fibrinolysis,Relaxation of the myometrium,Increased oxytocin secretion from the posterior pituitary gland,Shedding of the decidua,Retraction of the myometrium,E,"∙ The increase in maternal blood volume during pregnancy provides a reserve for the blood lossthat occurs at delivery. Changes also occur in the coagulation system, with an increase inclotting factors and a decrease in fibrinolysis.∙ Uterine contraction is initially responsible for controlling blood loss during the third stage. Clotformation and fibrin deposition occur rapidly and are essential in subsequent maintenance ofhemostasis.∙ As the placenta separates, the spiral arteries are exposed in the placental bed with the potentialfor massive haemorrhage. The spiral arteries run through a latticework of crisscrossing musclebundles that occlude and kink-off the vessels as they contract and retract. This arrangement ofmuscle bundles has been referred to as the ""living ligatures"" or ""physiologic sutures"" of theuterus.∙ Contraction and retraction of the myometrium is therefore central to the control of blood lossduring the third stage. Uterine atony is the most important cause of post-partum haemorrhage"

basic medicine,2021,Which of the following is true regarding magnesium?,Causes vascular smooth muscle contraction,Is an anti-tocolytic,Is predominantly an extracellular cation,Is used as an anticonvulsant,Potentiates deep tendon reflexes,D,"Magnesium is largely an intracellular cation present mainly in bone and skeletal muscle. Only 1% is in the extracellular fluid (ECF) and normal plasma levels are 0.75-1.05 mmol/L. Its effect can be described as antagonising the actions of calcium. Magnesium sulphate is used in pre-eclampsia as an anticonvulsant but it also relaxes vascular smooth muscle, causing vasodilatation, thus lowering the mean arterial blood pressure. It is also an effective tocolytic drug, helping to decrease uterine contractions. It acts at the neuromuscular junction, decreasing acetylcholine release, thus neuromuscular function is weakened. Therapeutic plasma levels of magnesium are 2.0-3.5 mmol/L, but side effects may occur above 4.0 mmol/L. Increasing plasma levels of magnesium causes deep tendon reflexes to gradually diminish until they become absent. Thus tendon reflexes are frequently used as a bedside measurement of hypermagnesaemia."

basic medicine,2023,"A 55-year-old lady has recently commenced on 20 mg of leflunomide daily for sero-negative rheumatoid arthritis. At baseline, prior to commencing the drug, her AST was 22 U/L (1-31) and her ALT was 30U/L (5-35). She attends for routine blood monitoring. Her FBC is normal but her liver function tests (LFTs) reveal:    AST 58 U/L (1-31)   ALT 71 U/L (5-35)   Alkaline phosphatase 100 U/L (45-105)   Bilirubin 12 µmol/L (1-22)    What is the most appropriate management option for this patient?",Continue leflunomide and monitor LFTs in one month,Continue leflunomide and monitor LFTs in two weeks,Reduce the dose and recheck LFTs in one week,Stop leflunomide and commence washout procedure,Stop the leflunomide and repeat tests in two weeks,C,"Leflunomide is associated with serious hepatotoxicity. Increased aminotransferases are commonly seen in association with therapy occurring in 15-20% of cases (less than a twofold rise). However, more serious elevation (greater than threefold) is seen in less than 5%. Generally, most hepatic events occur within the first six months of use. It is recommended liver function tests (LFTs) be checked monthly for six months and, if stable, two monthly thereafter. If aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is between two and three times the upper limit of normal, and the leflunomide dose is more than 10 mg daily, the dose should be reduced to 10 mg and LFTs rechecked weekly until normalised. If the ALT and AST are returning to normal, the patient should be left on 10 mg per day. It the LFTs remain elevated, leflunomide should be stopped and discussed with the specialist team. If the AST or ALT is more than three times the upper limit of normal, the LFTs should be rechecked within 72 hours. If they remain more than three times the reference range, leflunomide should be stopped and washout considered (cholestyramine and activated charcoal). It is important to note that the half life of leflunomide is usually two weeks (mean 1-4) therefore if a rapid response is required, washout should be considered. Current UK guidance also recommends frequent monitoring for patients on leflunomide. Full blood count (FBC) should be checked monthly for six months and, if stable, two monthly thereafter. White cell count less than 3.5, neutrophils less than 2 or platelets less than 150 should be discussed with the specialist team, and leflunomide withheld until this has taken place. Monitoring should be continued at least monthly in the long term if leflunomide is co-prescribed with any other immunosuppressant or potentially hepatotoxic agent. In addition, signs of leflunomide toxicity should be monitored. If the patient develops a rash or itch dose reduction should be considered, with or without the addition of antihistamines. If severe, leflunomide should be stopped and washout considered. Hair loss, headaches and gastrointestinal upset may also warrant dose reduction or washout. A blood pressure of greater than 140/90 mmHg should be treated as per NICE guidelines. If it remains elevated, stop leflunomide and consider washout. Weight should be monitored, and a weight loss of greater than 10% should be identified. If no other cause can be found, consider dose reduction or washout. If there is increasing shortness of breath, pneumonitis should be considered and leflunomide should be stopped. "

basic medicine,2041,Which of the following malignancies is correctly matched to the growth factor/hormone on which its growth is dependent?,Breast cancer and testosterone,Endometrial cancer and oestrogens,Myeloma and interleukin-12,Prostate cancer and oestrogens,Thyroid cancer and thyroxine,B,"While autonomy of growth is a feature of neoplasia, some neoplasms depend on certain growth factors/hormones for growth. A large proportion of breast cancers express oestrogen receptors and the expression of these receptors correlates with response to oestrogen blockade. Prostate epithelium is dependent on androgens for growth and survival, castration results in apoptosis and partial involution of the gland. This characteristic is retained by most prostate carcinomas and thus their growth can be inhibited by androgen blockade. Thyroid cancer responds to the stimulatory effects of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and this can be inhibited post thyroidectomy with thyroxine. Interleukin-6 (not interleucin 12) is a potent growth factor for myeloma. Endometrial cancer is markedly increased in patients receiving unopposed oestrogen therapy and advanced disease may be treated with progesterone therapy which shrinks the tumour."

This weakens the cell wall, and allows the cell to lyse under the influence of an osmotic gradient.The widespread resistance to penicillins is due to beta‐lactamase enzymes, which break the beta‐lactam ring and inactivate the drug.The beta‐lactamase enzyme is often encoded in the bacterial plasmid. The plasmid is bacterial DNA (separate from the main chromosome) that can be translocated from bacterium to bacterium, and it is for this reason that resistance may be also transferred.Although the penicillins have similar spectra of action, their specific spectra may be changed by altering the beta‐lactam side chain.They do not have significant toxic effects on humans, but allergy to them is common."
basic medicine,2061,Regarding melanoma,Melanocytes are derived from neural tube,Melanin is derived from tryptophan,Most commonly a benign tumor,More common in males,Malignant cells can cross placenta,E,"MELANOMA Melanoma is a cancer that begins in the melanocytes. Other names for this cancer include malignant melanoma and cutaneous melanoma. Most melanoma cells still make melanin, so melanoma tumors are usually brown or black. But some melanomas do not make melanin and can appear pink, tan, or even white. Melanomas can develop anywhere on the skin, but they are more likely to start on the trunk (chest and back) in men and on the legs in women. The neck and face are other common sites. Having darkly pigmented skin lowers your risk of melanoma at these more common sites, but anyone can get melanoma on the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, or under the nails. Melanomas in these areas make up a much larger portion of melanomas in African Americans than in whites. Melanomas can also form in other parts of your body, such as the eyes, mouth, genitals, and anal area, but these are much less common than melanoma of the skin. Melanoma is much less common than some other types of skin cancer. But melanoma is more dangerous because it’s much more likely to spread to other parts of the body if not caught and treated early.

basic medicine,2093,"A 19-year-old Chinese man presents to the Emergency Department with a severe rash. He was reviewed in the neurology clinic seven days earlier where he was diagnosed with partial epilepsy and started on carbamazepine therapy. He has a fever and sore throat with severe mucocutaneous ulceration. There is a generalised skin rash affecting the torso, arms and legs which he says began as erythematous patches, but there are now many vesicles, a number of which appear to have been de-roofed to form ulcers. Which of the following HLA types is he likely to have?",HLA A 30,HLA A 3101,HLA B 1502,HLA B 5701,HLA B 5801,C,"The answer is C), HLA B 1502. This man presents with Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), which is now well described in association with certain HLA types when carbamazepine is prescribed. HLA-B1502 has been shown to be a high-risk HLA type, and is present in about 10% of individuals of Han Chinese and Thai origin Some guidelines therefore suggest HLA screening of this population prior to commencing carbamazepine treatment. HLA A 3101 is the high risk HLA type for SJS in patients of Japanese and European origin. SJS in patients with A 3101 is generally less severe versus 1502, therefore screening isn't generally recommended. HLA A 30 is associated with a fixed drug eruption reaction in conjunction with co-trimoxazole prescribing, B5701 with hypersensitivity to abacavir and flucloxacillin liver hypersensitivity, and B 5801 is associated with hypersensitivity to allopurinol."

basic medicine,2097,Metabolic acidosis results from which of the following?,Excessive intake of water,Pyloric stenosis,Sulphonylureas,Thiazide diuretics,Uraemia,E,"Pyloric stenosis is an important cause of metabolic alkalosis. Sulphonylureas (e.g. glicazide) do not cause a metabolic acidosis. Biguanides (e.g. metformin), however, are associated with lactic acidosis in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment. Thiazide diuretics can cause metabolic alkalosis. Uraemia is a well recognised cause of metabolic acidosis although the precise mechanism is unclear. It may be related to the diversion of glutamate metabolism to the liver and the consequent bicarbonate consuming effect of hepatic ureagenesis.^1 "
basic medicine,2098,Which of the following is true with regard to the thyroid gland?,A thyroglossal cyst is an embryological remnant,It develops from the third branchial arch,It is not fully developed until the second year of life,The presence of lingual thyroid could lead to hyperthyroidism,The thyroglossal duct is closely related to the thyroid,A,"The thyroid gland is fully developed at birth. The development starts as early as 4 weeks of intrauterine life and is fully complete by 6 weeks. The thyroid develops from the caudal end of the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct extends from the foramen caecum in the tongue to the neck. A thyroglossal cyst develops from the epithelial remnants in the thyroglossal duct. The cyst usually appears in the first decade of life and is attached to the hyoid bone. Removal of the cyst necessitates removal of the body of the hyoid bone. The lingual thyroid may be the only thyroid tissue, and hence the patient may be hypothyroid or euthyroid."

As these muscles traverse medially, the fleshy part gives way to an aponeurosis which forms a sheath (rectus sheath) around the fourth muscle - the rectus abdominis. The rectus abdominis runs vertically on each side of the linea alba from the pubis (anterior aspect of the pubic symphysis and the pubic crest) to the front of the chest wall. A complete fascial sheet lying deep to the abdominal wall muscles surrounding the peritoneal cavity is called the transversalis fascia. The composition of the rectus sheath varies at different levels. The posterior wall of the rectus sheath thins out abruptly a short distance below the umbilicus to form the arcuate line. Above the arcuate line, the posterior wall of the sheath comprises the transversus abdominis aponeurosis and the posterior layer of the internal oblique aponeurosis. Below the arcuate line, all three aponeuroses pass anterior to the rectus and thus at this level the posterior surface of the rectus muscle is in direct contact with the transversalis fascia. In addition to the rectus abdominis, the rectus sheath contains the small pyramidalis muscle, the superior and inferior epigastric vessels, and the terminal parts of the lower six intercostal nerves."

basic medicine,2112,"In a chronic disease which has no known effective treatment, a new treatment is known to be effective in animal models and shows promise in short term studies in patients. There are some theoretical concerns about toxicity involving liver and bone marrow although no cases have been observed in studies so far. What is the most appropriate next step in the drug's development?",Case‐control study,Randomised double blind placebo controlled study,Open study,No further studies should be done and drug development should be stopped,Randomised single blind placebo controlled study,B,"The story that is described is of an early drug development that has gone through - Phase I trials (normal volunteers).- Phase II studies (more normal volunteers but it also mentions 'studies in patients'). - The next step in the development of this drug is a phase III study ‐ where the drug's efficacy and safety should be tested against a placebo.Broadly, the development of a new drug can be divided into pre‐clinical and clinical trials.Pre‐clinical development first involves identifying the target thought to be important in disease. Drug candidates are then identified, and their properties optimised. Pre‐clinical safety studies are then conducted to determine dosage, ensure safety and study pharmacokinetic properties. These involve both computer and animal models. All information gathered from pre‐clinical testing is submitted to the regulatory authorities, prior to moving to the clinical phase of drug development.Clinical trials have a number of phases:∙ In phase I the drug is usually given to healthy volunteers to determine its safety and pharmacokinetic properties in humans.∙ In phase II a small group of patients (typically 100‐250) are given the drug to evaluate its efficacy, optimum dose, safety and side effects (as these may be different in patients compared to healthy volunteers). If these trials are successful larger clinical trials can be planned.∙ Phase III trials typically involve more than 1000 patients, and are used to determine efficacy and side effects. If successful the drug must be registered by the authorities prior to being released to the market.It is important to note the majority of drugs identified in early pre‐clinical trials will never make it to market, as they are not shown to have a significant effect or they are associated with significant toxicity.Post‐marketing studies then continue to determine the long term and chronic toxicities. UK practitioners are requested to report any side effects via the yellow card scheme."

Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this man?",Dantrolene,Diazepam,Lidocaine,Propranolol,Verapamil,B,"Cocaine abuse is quite common and neurological and cardiovascular side effects predominate. Delirium, hyperthermia, arrhythmias, myocardial and cerebral infarction are reported. In this patient, the first consideration should be to establish adequate ventilation and support the circulation, and also to remove any residual cocaine from the nostrils. Generally, the toxic effects of cocaine are short-lived and relate to sympathetic stimulation, as in this case with tachycardia, pyrexia and hypertension. Initial treatment of cocaine poisoning involves intravenous administration of diazepam to control agitation, and cooling measures for hyperthermia. Sedation with diazepam may also be appropriate initial therapy for hypertension and tachycardia in this situation since the excessive sympathetic tone is largely centrally mediated. Control of anxiety and agitation with diazepam when combined with rapid cooling may also decrease heat production in hyperthermic patients. If further treatment is required, an intravenous nitrate is particularly useful for associated coronary artery spasm. "

basic medicine,2145,"Concerning the pharmacology of coagulation, which of the following is correct?",Alteplase is used in thrombolysis,Aprotinin is fibrinolytic,Carbamazepine increases the effect of warfarin,Factor VIIa (recombinant) is an anticoagulant,The effects of heparin are monitored using the international normalised ratio (INR),A,"Alteplase (tissue type plasminogen activator) is a thrombolytic and acts by activating plasminogen to form plasmin, which degrades fibrin and so breaks up thrombi. It is used in the treatment of myocardial infarction and life-threatening venous thrombosis. Aprotinin is an enzyme inhibitor acting on plasmin and kallikrein and is classed as an anti-fibrinolytic, thus inhibiting fibrinolysis. It is indicated in patients at high risk of blood loss. Warfarin is an oral anticoagulant and it inhibits the synthesis of vitamin K dependant factors II, VII, IX and X. Hepatic enzyme inducing agents, for example, carbamazepine and phenobarbitone reduce its effect. Enzyme inhibitors, such as valproate, enhance the effect of warfarin. If the enzyme-inducing drug is withdrawn without reducing the dose of warfarin, haemorrhage may occur. Factor VIIa (recombinant) is a purified coagulation factor used to treat patients with inhibitors to factors VIII and IX. It has been used successfully in patients with serious trauma in whom haemorrhage has been difficult to control surgically. Thus it can be classed as a procoagulant. Heparin is an anticoagulant and its effects are monitored by measuring the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), although thrombin and clotting times are also prolonged. It accelerates the action of antithrombin III, which inhibits activated factors XII, XI, X, IX and thrombin."

Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate treatment of his INR?,Cryoprecipitate,Fresh frozen plasma,Intravenous vitamin K,Oral vitamin K,Prothrombin complex concentrate and vit K,E,"This gentleman is having a potentially life-threatening bleed in the setting of a grossly elevated INR. Due to his warfarin therapy, he will have reduced levels of factors II, VII, IX, and X and requires replacement to correct his INR rapidly. This is most effectively achieved by the administration of prothrombin complex concentrate (Beriplex or Octaplex, 25-50 units/kg IV) and vitamin K. These result in complete reversal of the warfarin-induced anticoagulation within 10 minutes, but the clotting factors have a finite half-life and therefore 5 mg IV vitamin K should be given at the same time. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains more dilute clotting factors and therefore produces inferior correction and should not be used in the management of life-threatening bleeding (unless prothrombin complex concentrate is not available). Cryoprecipitate and oral vitamin K are not recommended for the management of life-threatening bleeding. "

This is used to determine the rough location of the gene responsible for disease, relative to another DNA sequence which has its position already known (a 'genetic marker'). Disease genes are mapped by measuring recombination against a panel of different markers. This can identify the region of the genome in which the disease gene lies, thus allowing more detailed investigation of this region. Southern blotting is a laboratory procedure in which DNA fragments that have been electrophoresed through a gel are transferred to a solid membrane such as nitrocellulose. The DNA can then be hybridised with a labelled probe and exposed to x ray film. Somatic cell hybridisation is a physical gene mapping technique in which somatic cells from two different species are fused and allowed to undergo cell division. Chromosomes from one species are selectively lost resulting in clones with only one or a few chromosomes from one of the species. FISH is a molecular cytogenetic technique in which labelled probes are hybridised with chromosomes and then visualised under a fluorescence microscope. SSCP is a technique for detecting variation in DNA sequence by running single-stranded DNA fragments through a non-denaturing gel. Fragments with differing secondary structure (conformation) caused by sequence variation will migrate at different rates."

basic medicine,2180,Gentamicin (7 mg/kg once daily) is administered to an elderly patient with severe urosepsis. Twenty-four hours post-administration gentamicin levels are more than 2 mg/L. Which of the following complications is this patient at most risk of?,Encephalopathy,Hepatotoxicity,Nephrotoxicity,Peripheral neuropathy,Retinopathy,C,"Prolonged exposure to gentamicin is likely to cause nephrotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients with renal impairment. This is more likely to develop if gentamicin accumulates over a course of treatment, and is usually due to acute tubular necrosis. It is therefore important to dose gentamicin according to body weight, and monitor levels, the frequency of which depends on which dosing schedule is being used. Extra caution is needed in elderly patients who are at a very high risk of acute renal failure. In this situation, the next dose of gentamicin should not be given if the gentamicin trough exceeds 2 mg/L. Gentamicin is also a vestibulotoxin, which can result in permanent loss of equilibrioception. This usually develops if gentamicin is taken at high doses for prolonged periods, although there are case reports where this developed within three to five days. This side effect can be used for therapeutic benefit in severe Meniere's disease. Hepatotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy are not classically associated with gentamicin."

basic medicine,2183,Clomiphene is thought to trigger ovulation by acting as antagonising oestrogen receptors in which part of the body?,Corpus luteum,Ovaries,Hypothalamus,Anterior pituitary,Posterior pituitary,C,"Clomiphene Clomiphene has both estrogen agonist and antagonist properties. It is often referred to as a Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM).It is used to stimulate ovulation in anovulatory infertility. It binds to estrogen receptors throughout the body. It is the inhibition of estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus that is thought to account for its effect on ovulation induction. Here, by inhibiting the negative feedback effect of estrogen on gonadotropin release there is up-regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, triggers the brain's pituitary gland to secrete an increased amount of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH (luteinizing hormone). GnRH stimulates pituitary gonadotrophins that drive ovarian follicular activity."

basic medicine,2185,Which of the following is correct concerning diabetic foot disease?,Doppler is a very useful investigation to accurately assess the foot pulses,Gangrene of the toes is usually preceded by loss of peripheral pulses,Is seen in less than 5% of patients with diabetes,More than 80% of amputations in diabetic patients are preceded by a foot ulcer,There is a 80% mortality after one year of a major limb amputation in diabetic patients,D,"Up to 15% of diabetic patients will develop a foot ulcer. It has been estimated that 40-60% of all non-traumatic amputations are for patients with diabetes and nearly 85% of these amputations are preceded by a foot ulcer. Within five years, up to 45% of patients undergo amputation of the contralateral limb.There is 50% mortality three years after a major limb amputation in diabetic patients. In diabetes, a presence of foot pulse could be misleading or erroneous since there might be no macrovascular involvement even in the presence of microvascular disease. In addition, there might be intimal hyperplasia and medial sclerosis leading to thickening of the vessel wall. Therefore, gangrene of the toes or even the foot (due to microvascular damage) can occur in the presence of peripheral pulses and a normal Doppler."

According to the SIGN national guidelines, how will you manage the child?",Advise paracetamol and or ibuprofen to relieve her pain,Prescribe clarithromycin for the child and advise her to start it immediately,Prescribe penicillin V for the child and advise she starts it immediately,Prescribe penicillin V for the child and advise she starts it in 24 hours if the pain does not improve,Refer to the ENT surgeons as this is the second episode,A,"Advise her to take paracetamol and or ibuprofen to relieve her pain. SIGN guidelines point out that in children without significant systemic features of infection such as fever and generalised illness apart from pain, there is no significant benefit of antibiotics. The guidelines state that if all children were treated with antibiotics, then the number needed to treat (NNT) would be 17 to avoid one clinical failure. Unfortunately practice in the management of otitis media in children varies considerably in children across the world, from 31% in the Netherlands to 98% in the USA and Australia. Additionally, for a very common condition, the number of well conducted clinical trials is small. This is one area which could have benefited from better randomised controlled trials of antibiotics at the outset, but on available evidence, rationalisation of antibiotic use to guard against the development of resistance is sensible.

basic medicine,2211,Which of the following statements concerning cannabinoids is true?,9-tetrahydrocannabinol is pharmacologically inactive,Cannabinoids have an opioid sparing effect,Cannabinoid receptors are found in the liver,Naloxone has no effect on the antinociceptive actions of cannabinoids,The bioavailability of cannabinoids following oral ingestion is 60%,B,"Cannabinoids are derived from the resin of the plant Cannabis sativa. The most active constituent of the resin is 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, which is highly lipid soluble and has a large volume of distribution. Bioavailability following oral ingestion is 6% (not 60%) and it is metabolised to polar water soluble compounds before being excreted by the kidneys. Cannabinoid receptors have been identified in the central nervous system and also the spleen. Agonism at these cannabinoid receptors reduces the amplitude of voltage-gated calcium currents, which reduces excitability and neurotransmitter release. Cannabinoids also have an agonistic action at opioid receptors and have been shown to exert an opioid sparing effect in chronic pain. Naloxone and other opioid antagonists block the antinociceptive actions, but not the behavioural effects. Prostaglandin production may also be reduced."

Which is the most appropriate management?,Breathing into a brown paper bag,Intravenous calcium gluconate,Oral calcium supplements,Oral thyroxine,Surgical re-exploration of the neck and revascularisation of the parathyroids,B,"Complications following thyroidectomy include:  Bleeding Recurrent and superior laryngeal nerve injury Infection, and Hypoparathyroidism.  The most common complication of total thyroidectomy is hypocalcaemia secondary to hypoparathyroidism. Parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is intimately involved in the regulation of serum calcium. Inadequate production of PTH leads to hypocalcaemia. Hypoparathyroidism, and the resulting hypocalcaemia, may be permanent or transient. Following thyroidectomy, especially total thyroidectomy, the serum calcium usually falls gradually and patients do not usually require supplementary medication before 24 hours. Patients who have symptomatic hypocalcaemia in the early postoperative period, or whose calcium levels continue to fall, require treatment. In the symptomatic patient, replace calcium with intravenous calcium gluconate."

basic medicine,2232,Which of the following is true of aminoglycosides?,Act on the bacterial cell wall,Are effective against anaerobes,Are inactive against staphlococcal infection,Damage the cochlear nerve,Damage the hair cells,E,"These antibiotics are derived from Streptomyces spp. and have limited activity against Gram positive bacteria (staphlococci and streptococci). They interrupt bacterial protein synthesis by inhibiting ribosomal function (30S ribosomal sub-unit). They are ineffective against anaerobes. Anaerobes produce phosphorylating adenylating or acetylating enzymes that inactivate aminoglycoside antibiotics. Aminoglycosides are nephrotoxic but this is a dose-related effect. They are also ototoxic (vestibular and auditory) particularly in the elderly. The damage is to the receptor hair cells to which there is a genetic succeptibility. Aminoglycosides can also impair neuromuscular transmission, so should be avoided in patients with myasthenia gravis. Excretion is via the kidney, and accumulation occurs in renal failure. Blood levels must be checked and caution taken with other nephrotoxic agents. The aminoglycosides group includes:  gentamicin neomycin streptomycin (TB) amikacin, and tobramycin.  All are bacteriocidal, and active against Gram negative aerobic organisms, for example, Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Proteus, Enterobacter, Acinetobacter. There is limited activity against Gram positive organisms where a combination with penicillin/ampicillin may be used, for example, in endocarditis. The British National Formulary (BNF) recommends that aminoglycosides should be used with penicillin, metronidazole, or both to improve broad coverage. Specifically amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin are active against Pseudomonas; streptomycin is effective and widely used against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Aminoglycosides should not be given with furosemide. If there is renal failure or high pre-dose serum levels, the dosing interval must be increased. Neomycin is too toxic for parenteral administration but the ointment can be used for skin infection. They are not absorbed from the gut, so must be given by injection (tobramycin can be given by a nebuliser)."

basic medicine,2235,Which of the following is true of dermoid cysts?,They are lined by columnar epithelium,They are mostly acquired,They are usually located on the medial angle of the eye,They do not contain hair within the cyst,Rupture is associated with foreign body type inflammation,E,"Dermoid cysts are solitary, or occasionally multiple, hamartomatous tumours. The tumour is covered by a thick dermis-like wall that contains multiple sebaceous glands and almost all skin adnexa. Hairs and large amounts of fatty masses cover poorly to fully differentiated structures derived from the ectoderm. Depending on the location of the lesion, dermoid cysts may contain substances such as nails, hair, horny masses and dental, cartilage-like and bone-like structures. Cutaneous cysts most commonly occur on the head (forehead), mainly laterally around the eyes. Occasionally, they occur on the neck or in a midline region."
basic medicine,2236,Which of the following is true regarding primary cartilaginous joints?,Are surrounded by a capsule enclosing a joint cavity,Are very mobile,Attach ribs to their costal cartilage,Bone ends are covered by hyaline cartilage,Symphysis pubis and xiphisternal joint are examples,C,"All joints in the body could be broadly divided into:  Fibrous Cartilaginous (primary and secondary), or Synovial (typical and atypical) joints.  Primary cartilaginous joints are formed when the bone meets (joins) a cartilage. They are quite immobile and very strong. The adjacent bone may fracture but the bone-cartilage interface very rarely separates. All epiphyses and the ribs attaching to their costal cartilages are examples of primary cartilaginous joints. In a synovial joint, the bone ends taking part are covered by hyaline cartilage and surrounded by a capsule enclosing a joint cavity. The capsule is lined internally by synovial membrane (containing synovial fluid) and the capsule is reinforced internally or externally or both by ligaments. All limb joints fall in this category. Symphysis pubis, xiphisternal joint and intervertebral discs are examples of secondary cartilaginous joints (fibrous tissue is present between the two cartilages). In fibrous joints, the ends are simply joined by fibrous tissue and the movement is negligible. The bones of the vault of the skull are united by fibrous joints."
basic medicine,2237,An orthopaedic surgeon is operating on a shoulder following an anterior dislocation. She uses an anterior approach to gain access to the shoulder joint.

Which of the cranial nerves is usually the first to be affected by a raised intracranial pressure?,The abducens nerve,The facial nerve,The hypoglossal nerve,The vagus nerve,The vestibulocochlear nerve,A,The abducens nerve leaves the brain at the posterior border of the pons and has a long intracranial course to cross the cavernous sinus infero-lateral to the internal carotid artery. Here it is medial to the optic nerve and below the oculomotor and trochlear nerves. It then enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure. It is vunerable to compression at many sites. It supplies the lateral rectus muscle.
basic medicine,2239,Which of the following is most true regarding infliximab?,Is a monoclonal antibody to the glycoprotein IIb-IIIa receptor,Is first line treatment for ulcerative colitis,Is licensed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,It prevents relapse of Crohn's disease in patients who are in remission,Must not be used in combination with methotrexate due to increased toxicity,C,"Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody to tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha. It is recommended by NICE for adults with rheumatoid arthritis who have both the following:  active rheumatoid arthritis as measured by disease activity score greater than 5.1 on at least two occasions one month apart, and undergone trials of two disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs including methotrexate (unless contraindicated); defined as six months of therapy with two months at standard dose (unless toxicity has limited treatment).  Before starting therapy and throughout treatment, patients should be evaluated carefully for tuberculosis as there have been reports of the onset or reactivation of TB including miliary TB and some unusual extrapulmonary TB. Infliximab should normally be used in combination with methotrexate and requires intravenous infusion in a hospital setting. If a patient is intolerant of methotrexate, adalimumab (humanised anti-TNF antibody) and etanercept (anti-TNF receptor antibody) are alternatives to infliximab which can be given as monotherapy. Response to treatment is assessed at six months, and only continued if there is an improvement in disease activity score of 1.2 points or more. Treatment is typically initiated with the least expensive drug, and the other agents only used if there is toxicity. In addition, infliximab has a role to play in refractory Crohn's disease. Some other monoclonal antibodies in clinical use include:  Digibind - Digoxin-binding antibody for treatment of overdoses (increases clearance). Abciximab - Glycoprotein IIbIIIa receptor (for unstable angina). Pexelizumab - Anti-C5 (complement) - anti-inflammatory: reduces myocardial infarction and death following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and angioplasty.  "
basic medicine,2240,With respect to renal handling of urea,Urea is secreted into the proximal tubule,Urea is actively absorbed by the distal loop of Henle,Urea is freely filtered at the glomerulus,99% of filtered urea is actively reabsorbed,Urea is transferred across the proximal tubule by facilitated diffusion,C,UREAFreely filtered at the renal glomerulus.· About 50% of the filtered urea is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule by a paracellular route· Urea is secreted into the tubule fluid in the descending limb of the loop of Henle by carrier mediatedtransport · Final urea excretion is dependent on the additional amount reabsorbed by carrier-mediatedtransport in the medullary collecting ducts. This reabsorption increases at low urine flows and decreasesat high urine flows and is controlled by ADH.
basic medicine,2241,The effects of noradrenaline on the heart include which of the following?,Bradycardia,Decreased potassium conductance of the membranes of pacemaker cells,Decreased strength of cardiac contraction,Increased concentration of free calcium in the myoplasm,Increased duration of the cardiac action potential,D,"Noradrenaline is positively inotropic and positively chronotropic (beta 1 has direct effect on the heart). By increasing free calcium concentration in the cardiomyocyte, noradrenaline facilitates increased force of contraction, and tachycardia. Noradrenaline reduces the duration of the cardiac action potential, and increases potassium conductance. Noradrenaline causes vasoconstriction (α1 and α2). This results in increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Blood pressure then increases; this increased blood pressure stimulates baroreceptors which the reduce heart rate via vagal stimulation. Vagal stimulation is stonger than the chrontrophic effects so, after a brief initial increase in heart rate, the heart rate then falls. Adrenaline does not cause increased overall SVR so heart rate increases."

basic medicine,2248,Which one of the following is true of atropine?,Causes agitation and hallucination,Is a non-competitive nicotinic antagonist,Is a bronchconstrictor,Its topical effects wear off in 24 hours,Does not cross the blood brain barrier,A,"Atropine and its derivative, ipratropium bromide (atrovent), are bronchodilators due to competitive inhibition of bronchial muscarinic receptors. Atropine is a tertiary amine (i.e. uncharged) and it crosses the blood brain barrier readily. Central anticholinergic syndrome is seen, particularly in the elderly and the symptoms include:  agitation hallucination drowsiness somnolence amnesia dysarthria, and ataxia (although the stimulatory effects are more common with atropine).  An initial bradycardia may occasionally follow atropine administration, and this is called the Bezold-Jarisch reflex. It is thought to be due to stimulation of the muscarinic type 2 (M2) receptors, before the muscarinic type 1 (M1) effect supervenes. Its topical effects on the eye (mydriatic) wear off in 7-14 days. Atropine is a competitive muscarinic antagonist (not non-competitive), although there may be nicotinic effects at very high doses, this remains competitive antagonism."

Which of the following is the most commonly recognised side effect of this drug?,Gout,Hypokalaemia,Renal stones,Taste disturbances,Urinary retention,E,"Many adverse effects of amitriptyline and similar tricyclic antidepressants are caused by their antimuscarinic actions. Antimuscarinic effects are relatively common and occur before an antidepressant effect is obtained. They include:  Dry mouth Constipation occasionally leading to paralytic ileus Urinary retention Blurred vision and disturbances in accommodation Increased intraocular pressure, and Hyperthermia.  Tolerance is often achieved if treatment is continued and adverse effects may be less troublesome if treatment is begun with small doses and then increased gradually, although this may delay the clinical response. Drowsiness may also be common, although a few tricyclic antidepressants possess little or no sedative potential and may produce nervousness and insomnia. Other neurological adverse effects include:  Headache Peripheral neuropathy Tremor Ataxia Epileptiform seizures Tinnitus, and Occasional extrapyramidal symptoms including speech difficulties (dysarthria).  Confusion, hallucinations, or delirium may occur, particularly in the elderly, and mania or hypomania, and behavioural disturbances (particularly in children) have been reported.

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) would be high. Serum biochemistry is normal in osteoporosis, although alkaline phosphatase can be elevated following a fracture. Paget's disease is associated with normal calcium and phosphate with raised alkaline phosphatase. In chronic renal failure there is inadequate 1-alpha hydroxylation of vitamin D, preventing the formation of active 1,25 dihydroxy vitamin D. This results in a low serum calcium and a compensatory high PTH (secondary and tertiary hyperparathyroidism). Phosphate is elevated due to altered excretion."
basic medicine,2285,Which of the following statements concerning intravenous fluids is correct?,0.9% saline solution has a similar pH to plasma,Colloids generally have lower sodium concentrations than 0.9% saline,Hartmann's solution has a higher chloride concentration than 0.9% saline,Hydroxyethyl starch solutions interfere with blood cross-matching,Pruritus is associated with the use of hydroxyethyl starch solutions,E,"Hartmann's solution contains:  131 mmol per litre of sodium ions 111 mmol per litre of chloride ions 2 mmol per litre of calcium ions 5 mmol per litre of potassium ions 29 mmol per litre of lactate ions.  Therefore, it has a lower chloride concentration than 0.9% saline, which contains 154 mmol per litre of sodium and chloride ions. 0.9% saline has a pH of 5.5, whereas plasma pH is approximately 7.4. Hydroxyethyl starch solutions do not interfere with blood cross-matching, unlike the dextrans, although rouleaux formation may occur. Artificial colloids are suspensions of large molecules in 0.9% saline, and therefore contain 154 mmol per litre of sodium (the same). The hydroxyethyl starches are removed from the circulation by the reticuloendothelial system and are deposited in the skin. Pruritus is therefore a relatively common and significant sequel of over-enthusiastic administration of starches."

basic medicine,2287,Which of the following is correct regarding haematocrit?,Is lower in venous blood than in arterial blood,Optimal value following haemorrhage is about 0.04,Should be expressed as a fraction,When below normal values tissue oxygen delivery is decreased,When high the viscosity of blood is reduced,D,"The haematocrit is the total red blood cell volume as a proportion of blood volume, and it is expressed as a percentage not as a fraction. Normal values are 0.4-0.54 (male) and 0.37-0.47 (female). Venous blood has a higher haematocrit than arterial blood, because of the entry of chloride ions into red cells (chloride shift) which is followed by water entry by osmosis. A fall in haematocrit decreases the viscosity and thus increases the flow. Therefore, a haematocrit of about 0.3 after acute blood loss is thought to be optimal; in addition to reducing the viscosity and improving tissue blood flow, the hazards of blood transfusion and deep vein thrombosis are reduced. However, a value below 0.3 is undesirable because of reduced oxygen carrying capacity."

basic medicine,2292,Which one of the following statements is true concerning body water in a 70 kg man?,Distribution depends on osmolar content of various compartments,Extracellular fluid is approximately 28 litres,Intracellular fluid is approximately 14 litres,Plasma volume is 7 litres,Total body water is approximately 55 litres,A,"Total body water is roughly 50-60% of body weight, so this man's TBW would be roughly 40 litres. Of this extracellular water would be roughly a third with intracellular fluid making up 2/3. Obviously, the distribution of body water is affected by the osmolality (protein concentrations both intra- and extracellularly)."
basic medicine,2293,A 29 year old patient who is 22 weeks pregnant seeks your advice as she was recently exposed to chickenpox. Regarding fetal varicella syndrome (FVS) which of the following statements is correct regarding maternal varicella infection?,FVS may result if there is maternal varicella infection within the 5 days prior to labour,FVS may result if there is maternal varicella infection within the last 6 weeks gestation,FVS may result if there is maternal varicella infection within the 1st 6 weeks gestation,FVS may result if there is maternal varicella infection within the 1st 20 weeks gestation,FVS may result if there is maternal varicella infection at any time during pregnancy,D,Congenital fetal varicella syndrome may occur if there is maternal varicella infection (chickenpox) during the 1st 20 weeks of gestation. The risk of FVS to babies born to mothers who have chickenpox during the first 20 weeks gestation is 0.4% (1-12 weeks) -2.0% (13-20 weeks). If a mother has chickenpox in late pregnancy (5 days prior to delivery) then there is risk of neonatal varicella infection which may be severe. Varicella Zoster Varicella Zoster is the virus responsible for Chicken pox and shingles. If Chickenpox occurs during pregnancy the Green Top Guidelines advise the following:VZIG has no therapeutic benefit once chickenpox has developed and should therefore not be used in pregnant women who have developed a chickenpox rash. Intravenous aciclovir should be given to all pregnant women with severe chickenpox Oral aciclovir should be prescribed for pregnant women with chickenpox if they present within 24 hours of the onset of the rash and if they are 20+0 weeks of gestation or beyond. Use of aciclovir before 20+0 weeks should also be considered

You note her pupils are dilated. Which of the following is the most likely culprit?",Ethanol,Diazepam,Heroin,Cocaine,Morphine Sulphate,D,"The combination of increased energy levels, euphoria, sexually inappropriate behaviour and dilated pupils makes the most likely cause cocaine. Alcohol does not affect pupils. Benzodiazepines can cause dilation however her behaviour is not inkeeping with this. Heroin and MST both lead to constriction of pupils."
basic medicine,2295,Which of the following proteins is a major tumour suppressor?,TNF alpha,p53,HLA B27,IL-8,RAS,B,P53 is a protein that is encoded by the TP53 gene in humans. TP53 gene is located on the short arm of chromosome 17. It has been dubbed the 'guardian of the genome' as it suppresses tumour formation and therefore cancer by preventing genome mutation.P53 inactivation or mutation is essential for the formation of the majority of human cancers.
basic medicine,2296,Which of the following is correctly paired?,Conn's syndrome and metabolic acidosis,High altitude and respiratory acidosis,Pancreatic fistula and metabolic acidosis,Shock and metabolic alkalosis,Uretero-colic anastomosis and hyperchloraemic alkalosis,C,"Conn's syndrome (hyperaldosteronism) produces an alkalosis due to potassium/hydrogen exchange. Altitude sets up over-breathing with a respiratory alkalosis. A pancreatic fistula causes loss of bicarbonate and a metabolic acidosis. All types of shock result in reduced tissue perfusion causing lactic acidosis. A uretero-colic anastomosis produces a hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic acidosis in 80% of patients."
basic medicine,2297,Which of the following produce severe hyperkalaemia in combination?,Furosemide and amiloride,Lisinopril and furosemide,Aspirin and allopurinol,Losartan and amiloride,Propranolol and verapamil,D,The combination of angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin blockers with potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone and amiloride may produce dangerous hyperkalaemia.Amiloride is often given with furosemide (co‐amilofruse) to replete potassium stores. Propranolol is not given with verapamil due to the induction of severe bradycardia.
basic medicine,2298,Which of the following is true regarding the female breast?,Develops lactiferous ducts at puberty,Is drained by the internal thoracic vein,Is derived embryologically from endoderm,Lies between the first and fifth rib,Lies only partially in the superficial fascia,B,"At the end of the first month of embryonic development the mammary gland begins to develop as a solid bud of epidermis into the underlying mesenchyme.This primary bud occurs from the cranial part of the mammary ridges, thickened strips of ectoderm. Each primary bud give rise to several secondary buds that develop into the lactiferous ducts and their branches that make up the mammary gland.The arteries supplying the breast are derived from:∙ Lateral thoracic artery∙ Internal thoracic artery, and∙ Intercostal arteries.The internal thoracic artery and its perforating branches supply a medial part of the breast. The lateral thoracic artery supplies a lateral part of the breast. Profound part is supplied by intercostal arteries and their branches.The veins describe an anastomotic circle round the base of the nipple, called circulus venosus by Haller. From this, large branches transmit the blood from medial part of the breast into internal thoracic veins, and from the lateral part of the breast into lateral thoracic vein and intercostal veins.The lymph vessels of the breast are situated into two layers (superficial and profound), making networks that are interconnected. Superficial lymph vessels transmit the lymph fluid into axillary lymph nodes."
basic medicine,2299,"A 65-year-old man, with a history of smoking presents with chronic cough, haemoptysis and weight loss. His chest x ray shows a cavitating lesion. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Adenocarcinoma,Alveolar cell carcinoma,Small cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Undifferentiated large cell carcinoma,D,"The combination of cough, haemoptysis, and weight loss in a smoker should lead you to consider lung carcinoma as a possible diagnosis. A lifelong smoker has a 20 to 30 times increased risk of lung carcinoma compared to a non-smoker. Haemoptysis in particular is one of the common presenting symptoms of carcinoma. The two major forms of lung carcinoma are non-small cell lung carcinoma (85%) and small cell lung carcinoma (15%). Non-small cell lung carcinomas are further divided into squamous cell (35%), adenocarcinoma (30%), undifferentiated large cell (10%) and bronchial-alveolar cell (5%). Squamous cell carcinomas usually arise from a central airway, and cavitate. Small cell carcinomas arise in the central airways and grow rapidly. Adenocarcinomas may be peripheral and slow-growing; they are the commonest lung carcinomas in non-smokers. Smoking is associated with all forms but is most strongly linked with small-cell and squamous cell carcinoma. Other causes of cavitating lung lesions include:  Infection (Staphylococcus aureus, tuberculosis, Klebsiella, Pneumocystis jiroveci) Pulmonary infarcts Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and Rheumatoid nodules."

basic medicine,2302,Which of the following is a laboratory feature of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)?,Decreased fibrin degradation products,Fragmented red blood cells,Increased fibrinogen level,Normal PT,Shortened APTT,B,"DIC is a systemic thrombo-haemorrhagic disorder which is a pathological response to many underlying disorders. The haemostatic mechanisms are activated by the underlying disorder leading to microvascular thrombosis and consumption of haemostatic factors. These in turn lead to ischaemic tissue damage, red blood cell haemolysis, fibrinolysis and haemorrhage. Laboratory findings include:  Thrombocytopenia Prolonged PT, APTT and TT Increased fibrin degradation products Reduced fibrinogen level, and Fragmented red blood cells.  "
basic medicine,2303,"A 72-year-old woman comes to the Emergency department complaining of nausea and vomiting. Apparently she saw the on-call GP a few days earlier and was prescribed clarithromycin for a respiratory tract infection. Past medical history of note includes COPD for which she takes high dose Seretide, tiotropium and oral theophylline, ischaemic heart disease for which she takes ramipril, amlodipine and indapamide and chronic renal failure. On examination her BP is 132/70 mmHg, and her pulse is 105 (atrial fibrillation). She has bibasal crackles consistent with mild LVF. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 7.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 197 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 145 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following medications is likely to have resulted in her presentation?",Amlodipine,Indapamide,Ramipril,Theophylline,Tiotropium,D,"This question illustrates the potential dangers of polypharmacy. She has been prescribed clarithromycin which leads to a significant increase in the theophylline AUC, precipitating toxicity with atrial fibrillation, nausea and vomiting. In reality theophylline is a reasonably ineffective option in the treatment of COPD and in a patient with a history of ischaemic heart disease, risk of arrhythmias is increased. Clarithromycin is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, and as such may interfere significantly with metabolism of a number of medications, including theophylline, simvastatin, and cyclosporine as the most important drug interactions. The effect of warfarin and digoxin may also be potentiated by clarithromycin. "

basic medicine,2312,Which term best describes the affinity of a drug for its receptor?,Efficacy,Intrinsic activity,Potency,Selectivity,Therapeutic effect,C,Affinity is the measure of the net molecular attraction between a drug (or neurotransmitter or hormone) and its receptor. The receptor's affinity for binding a drug determines the concentration of drug required to form a significant number of drug-receptor complexes. Affinity and intrinsic activity are determinants of potency. Efficacy contributes both to potency and to the maximum effect of the agonist. Efficacy is a measure of the efficiency of the drug-receptor complex in initiating the signal transduction process.

basic medicine,2320,"A 53-year-old woman is admitted with nausea and vomiting. She has inoperable cancer with pain due to posterior abdominal wall infiltration. This has been controlled well with Kapake (codeine 30 mg and paracetamol 500 mg), two tablets four times per day. Which is the best option for controlling her pain?",Fentanyl skin patch,Intramuscular pethidine,Morphine four hourly orally and as needed intramuscularly,Rectal non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug,Subcutaneous diamorphine by continuous infusion,E,"This patient has inoperable carcinoma and already needs opiate analgesia orally; as she is vomiting she will need parenteral analgesia. The most effective way of achieving this, and being able effectively to titrate the dose to achieve adequate analgesia, is subcutaneous diamorphine by continuous infusion. Fentanyl patches are difficult to titrate because they are used for 72 hours. You usually therefore only use them once a patient has a stable opiate usage. Intramuscular pethidine has a delayed onset and its effect is prolonged, which again is not ideal when you do not know what the patient's opiate requirements are. Oral morphine is unlikely to be tolerated whilst she is vomiting. Non-steroidals are unlikely to be sufficient in this case."

basic medicine,2322,"A 52-year-old accountant presents with a five hour history of confusion and agitation. He is known to have an alcohol problem but has avoided all alcohol for the last three days. On examination, he is sweating, agitated, and disorientated. He claims to see things on the walls. His temperature is 37.5°C, pulse 110 bpm regular and blood pressure is 152/74 mmHg. FBC and Uandamp;Es are both normal. Investigations reveal:    Plasma glucose 4.6 mmol/L (3.6-6)    Which of the following agents would be the most appropriate treatment for this man?",IV haloperidol,Oral lorazepam,IV phenobarbital,IV phenytoin,Oral diazepam,B,"This is a typical history of delirium tremens (DTs). In the UK it is estimated 24% of adults drink in a hazardous way, which is highest in the North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber. Approximately 20% of patients admitted to hospital for illnesses unrelated to alcohol are drinking at potentially hazardous levels, and its therefore important to ask all patients about their alcohol use. An abrupt reduction in alcohol intake in a person who has been drinking excessively for a prolonged period of time, for example as occurs on admission to hospital, may results in the development of alcohol withdrawal. Symptoms typically present about 8 hours after a significant fall in blood alcohol levels. The peak is on day two, and by day five the symptoms are significantly better. Minor withdrawal symptoms appear 6-12 hours after cessation of alcohol and include: insomnia, fatigue, tremor, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, headache, sweating, palpitations, anorexia, depression and craving. Alcoholic hallucinosis can appear 12-24 hours after stopping alcohol and includes visual, auditory and tactile hallucinations. Withdrawal seizures can appear 24-48 hours after cessation and are generalised tonic-clonic seizures. Alcohol withdrawal delirium ('delerium tremens') can appear 48-72 hours after cessation. This patient has delirium tremens, which should be treated as a medical emergency. The signs of altered mental status alert you to the fact that this is different from simple alcohol withdrawal. These signs can include hallucinations (auditory, visual, olfactory), confusion, delusions and severe agitation. Seizures can also occur. Delirium tremens is a hyperadrenergic state, and is often associated with tachycardia, hyperthermia, hypertension, tachypnoea, tremor and mydirasis. Patients at increased risk are those with a previous history of delirium tremens or alcohol withdrawal seizures, those with a co-existing infection or abnormal liver function, and older patients. It is a clinical diagnosis. Delirium tremens should be treated with oral lorazepam as first-line treatment. If the symptoms persist, or the medication is refused, parenteral lorazepam, haloperidol or olanzapine should be given. Intensive care may be required. If delirium tremens develops during treatment for acute withdrawal, the reducing regime should be reviewed. The mortality rate can be up to 35% if untreated, which reduces to 5% with early recognition and treatment. In patients with alcohol withdrawal seizures, a quick-acting benzodiazepine should be given (such as lorazepam). Phenytoin should not be given. Patients who are at high-risk of alcohol withdrawal but have no or only mild symptoms are typically given a reducing dose of chlordiazepoxide (a long-acting benzodiazepine) over 5-7 days. Diazepam is an alternative. Chlormethiazole may also be offered as an alternative, but is rarely used as if used with alcohol there is a risk of fatal respiratory depression, especially in patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, you should not forget the importance of giving high-potency B vitamins, specifically thiamine (e.g. pabrinex) to all patients with a history of high alcohol intake to reduce the risk of Wernicke's encephalopathy.

basic medicine,2327,Which of the following is true of carcinoma of the parotid gland?,Has a good prognosis,Is not associated with pleomorphic adenomas,Is typically a squamous carcinoma,Is typically associated with facial paralysis at presentation,Radical en bloc surgery and radiotherapy is the treatment of choice,E,"The commonest malignant tumours of the salivary glands are adenoid cystic carcinoma and carcinoma arising in a pleomorphic adenoma. Squamous cell carcinoma is very rare and aggressive, growing rapidly with 50% having lymph node involvement at presentation. Eighty per cent of tumours are in the parotid gland and 80% of these are benign. A parotid lump with involvement of the facial nerve is highly suggestive of malignancy. Facial paralysis occurs due to the passage of the nerve through the gland, with:  absence of tone of facial muscles asymmetry loss of nasolabial fold, and drooping corner of the mouth.  It can occur in roughly 25% of cases. Management of a malignant parotid lump requires radical en bloc resection and radiotherapy. However if a lump thought to be benign, is treated by superficial parotidectomy, and is subsequently found to be malignant, the options include watch and wait, radiotherapy or further surgery. Prognosis with malignant tumours of the parotid gland is poor with a less than 30% five year survival."

basic medicine,2329,Which one of the following is most likely to inhibit wound healing?,Antiseptic wound cleaning,Magnesium deficiency,Moist dressings,Prolonged opiate analgesia,Vitamin D deficiency,A,"Wound healing is delayed in:  Zinc deficiency Methionine deficiency Vitamin C deficiency (scurvy) Hypothermia Diabetes Malnutrition, and Cushing's syndrome.  Early wound exposure may cause dehydration and so slow skin healing. Antiseptics may damage skin and impair healing. A moist environment is the ideal for wound healing. The optimal temperature for healing is 37°C. Frequent dressing changes, exposure and cold cleaning/antiseptic solutions all reduce the skin temperature and so may slow the healing process."
basic medicine,2330,Which of the following is true regarding the anal canal?,Develops embryologically from the proctodeum,Is approximately 8 cm long,Is separated laterally by the levator ani from the urinary bladder,Is separated posteriorly from the vagina by the perineal body,Passes anteriorly through the pelvic floor,A,The anal canal is the terminal part of the alimentary tract. The anal canal develops from the ectoderm over the cloacal membrane which becomes depressed and forms a pit in the proctodeum. The anal canal is a continuation of the rectum which turns posteriorly through the pelvic floor and opens externally at the anus. It measures approximately 4 cm in length. Posteriorly it is related to the anococcygeal body; laterally the levator ani separates it from the ischiorectal fossa. Anteriorly the perineal body separates it from the vagina in the female and from the bulb of the penis and the prostate gland in the male. The canal is surrounded by the internal and external anal sphincter muscles.
basic medicine,2331,"Which one of the following represents normal pressures found in the various vessels and heart chambers in healthy individuals, during the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter?",The diastolic pressure in the right ventricle is 10-15 mmHg,The pulmonary artery occlusion pressure is 4-12 mmHg,The right atrium has a mean pressure of 10-20 mmHg,The systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery is 30-35 mmHg,The systolic pressure in the right ventricle is 30-40 mmHg,B,"The distal lumen of the pulmonary artery catheter is connected to a pressure monitoring system for continuous monitoring as the balloon-tipped catheter is advanced. Low pressure waves are seen as the catheter enters the right atrium (mean of 3-8 mmHg). Entry of the catheter into the right ventricle displays tall pressure waves (15-25 mmHg systolic and 0-10 mmHg diastolic). Inflation of the balloon directs the catheter through the pulmonary valve into the pulmonary artery, results in the pressure waveform displaying higher diastolic pressures (10-20 mmHg), but similar systolic pressures to the right ventricle (15-25 mmHg). A dicrotic notch may be seen on the pulmonary artery waveform, which is caused by the closure of the pulmonary valve. Wedging of the catheter balloon in a branch of the pulmonary artery causes damping of the pressure waveform (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure or wedge pressure). The mean pressure measured during wedging is 4-12 mmHg, and this reflects the filing pressure in the left side of the heart."
basic medicine,2332,Which one of the following is considered to be a risk factor for post-operative wound infection?,Chronic obstructive airways disease,Incorporation of a synthetic mesh,Post-operative anaemia,Recent planned weight loss of 10 kg,Post-operative ileus,C,"Diabetic patients are more likely to develop a wound infection due to impaired white cell function. Smoking, obesity, chronic renal failure, jaundice, alcoholism and previous radiotherapy/chemotherapy are other factors that may increase the incidence of wound infection. Significant malnutrition (from whatever cause) is a factor but not planned weight loss. Incorporation of synthetic material does not increase the risk of wound infection but if the material does become infected it may result in a chronically discharging wound. Rough handling of tissue is more likely to result in tissue necrosis predisposing to wound infection. If rough handling is accompanied by poor haemostasis there may be a haematoma, which can readily become infected and cause a wound breakdown. Tissue hypoxia increases the risk of poor wound healing and subsequent infection. Post-operative anaemia is a risk factor for wound infection. However, COPD (because it is so variable in severity) is not clearly identified as an independent risk factor. Post-operative ileus does not directly increase the incidence of wound infection but prolonged hospital stay increases the risk of all infections, including the risk of MRSA."
basic medicine,2333,"A 58-year-old Italian man visits your surgery. He has noticed 'bruises' on his right foot which have been gradually increasing in number and size over the last six months. On examination there are several small, purple, non-tender lesions on the dorsum of his right foot and ankle. They have the appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma. Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by infection with which organism?",Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2),Human cytomegalovirus,Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8),Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),Pneumocystis jirovecii,C,"Kaposi's sarcoma is a tumour caused by infection with human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV8) also known as Kaposi's sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV). It became known as one of the AIDS-defining illnesses in the 1980s. The viral cause for this cancer was discovered in 1994. There is a lack of awareness of its viral causation even among people at risk of infection with KSHV/HHV8. There are four subtypes of Kaposi's sarcoma affecting susceptible groups of people:  Classic Kaposi's sarcoma (affecting middle aged men of Mediterranean or Ashkenasi Jewish descent) African endemic Kaposi's sarcoma Kaposi's sarcoma in iatrogenically immunosuppressed patients (for example, transplant-related), and AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma."

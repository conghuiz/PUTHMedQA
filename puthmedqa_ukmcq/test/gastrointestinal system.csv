gastrointestinal system,1,"An 18-year-old man with a history of hereditary spherocytosis presents to the Emergency Department with extreme lethargy, shortness of breath, and mild chest pain on exertion, which has developed over the past few days. He reports suffering a short flu-like illness associated with a rash affecting his cheeks a few days before the symptoms began. He has suffered from one episode of cholecystitis during the past few years, and has so far declined splenectomy. On examination his BP is 105/82, pulse is 95 and regular. He looks very pale. He has a palpable spleen on abdominal palpation. Investigations:    Hb 48g/l 135-180   WCC 5.2 ×10^9/L 6-10   PLT 132×10^9/L 150-400   Na 138 mmol/l 135-145   K 4.1 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 98 µmol/l 60-110   CRP 65 mg/l less than10    Which of the following is the most likely cause of his anaemia?",Cytomegalovirus infection,Epstein Barr virus infection,Influenza virus infection,Parvovirus B19 infection,Rubella infection,D,"The answer is Parvovirus B19 infection. Parvovirus B19 is a single stranded DNA virus and is associated with aplastic crisis in patients pre-disposed to haemolytic anaemia, including those with hereditary spherocytosis. It's likely the flu-like illness reported here was B19 infection, which affects erythrocyte precursors hence its ability to result in severe anaemia in patients whose red cells have a shorter lifespan than normal. Patients with severe aplastic crisis are likely to require red cell transfusion until their counts recover, which is usually associated with clearance of the infection over a 10-14 day period. CMV, Epstein Barr, and influenza virus do not affect the erythrocyte precursors, and are therefore not associated with aplastic crisis. Although rubella infection presents with similar symptoms to parvovirus infection, it is not classically associated with anaemia, and it is unlikely in this patient given he will most likely have been vaccinated."
gastrointestinal system,2,"A 55-year-old male presents with dysphagia, retrosternal discomfort, and weight loss. Studies reveal achalasia. Which of the following is most likely to provide symptomatic relief?",Buscopan ,Diazepam ,Nifedipine ,Omeprazole ,Surgical cardiomyotomy ,E,"Both calcium channel blockers (nifedipine) and nitrates relax the lower oesophageal sphincter. However, the effect on symptoms is variable, short-lived, and usually suboptimal. Use is frequently limited by adverse effects. Consequently, medical therapy is typically limited to those patients too frail or unwilling to undergo definitive treatment or other therapies. Studies looking at the efficacy of medical therapies are typically small and uncontrolled and tend to overestimate the benefit of an intervention. Study estimates of symptom improvement with medical therapy vary between 53-87%. None, however, claim to achieve full symptom improvement. On the other hand pooled results from five studies of surgical procedures (Heller myotomy) show good to excellent symptom response in 82% of patients. Other studies of surgical techniques typically show symptom response rates of 84-100%. Benefit seems to persist for at least 16 months beyond this although there may be some recurrence. Reflux is the most common side effect and a concomitant antireflux procedure (Nissen's fundoplication) may be performed. Botox applied to the lower oesophageal sphincter is a recent therapy with good efficacy. However, its effects are short-lived (typically less than six months) and use is generally recommended to be restricted to the frail or elderly in whom more aggressive therapy poses high risk. None of other choices help the symptoms. Oesophageal dilatation is usually attempted before laparoscopic surgical myotomy. "
gastrointestinal system,3,"A 60 year old patient presents with painless jaundice. On further questioning he has noticed some weight loss over the last few months. He is a heavy smoker and has a past medical history of COPD. On examination his abdomen is soft and non tender and he is clearly icteric. His bloods reveal deranged LFTs with an alkaline phosphates of 240 and a bilirubin of 92, ALT and AST are both around 200. An ultrasound of his abdomen is performed and shows both intra and extrahepatic bowel duct dilatation within the liver.",CT CAP,MRCP,ERCP,Liver biopsy,Liver screen,B,The most likely diagnosis here is cholangiocarcinoma as suggested by the ultrasound findings of intra and extrahepatic duct dilatation and the deranged LFTs which are cholestatic. There may well have been a primary sclerosing cholangitis previously which led onto the development of cholangiocarcinoma. The history is also more indicative of a carcinoma.
gastrointestinal system,4,"A 32-year-old woman presents to the surgical outpatient clinic with intermittent dysphagia for solids and liquids, which is exacerbated by stress. She also gives a history of delayed regurgitation of food. There is no gastric air bubble seen on plain radiography, and chest x ray reveals a double right heart border. Choose the single most appropriate diagnosis.",Achalasia cardia,Pharyngeal palsy,Plummer-Vinson syndrome (pharyngeal web),Retrosternal goitre,Syringomyelia,A,"The history and findings in this patient are very suggestive of achalasia cardia, a condition where there is a neuromuscular failure of relaxation at the lower end of the oesophagus due to loss of ganglia from the Auerbach's plexus. It affects more females than males (3:2) and is common during the third decade of life. There is progressive dysphagia to solids and liquids, chest pain and regurgitation of old food from the dilated oesophageal sac. There is no gastric air bubble because the dilated oesophagus never completely empties and therefore swallowed air cannot pass into the stomach. Chest x ray shows air or fluid level behind the heart and the expanded oesophagus gives the appearance of a 'double right heart border'."
gastrointestinal system,5,A 68 year old male presents with severe colicky abdominal pain.  Surprisingly there is only minimal generalised tenderness and no evidence of guarding.  He gives a history of weight loss and pain after eating for the last 6 months. He has previously had a myocardial infarction.  His bloods reveal raised inflammatory markers and a metabolic acidosis.  What investigation would be most useful for the definitive diagnosis?,CT angiography,Abdominal Xray,Angiography,CT abdomen,Amylase,A,"This history is indicative of acute on chronic mesenteric ischaemia.  This often presents with severe pain with surprisingly little to find on examination in the early stages.  The history of postprandial angina is typical of chronic mesenteric ischaemia.   Due to his history of an MI then he us likely to be an arteriopath and thus thrombus formation leading to ischaemia.  AS well as atherosclerosis and thrombus formation, there may be emboli such as AF or other causes include hypotension, coagulopathic states, infection and certain drugs such as cocaine. Raised inflammatory markers and metabolic acidosis is typical.  AXR is useful in the first place to to exclude other causes and may show thumbprinting but most often now a CT of the abdomen is performed and may show bowel wall and mesenteric oedema, pneumatosis intestinalis and thumbprinting.    The gold standard was p[previously angiography however CT angiography is now more commonly used.  Multidetector CT with IV contrast is thought to be very useful for the diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery occlusion. Treatment options include medical management with papaverine (relieves vasospasm) and thrombolytics and surgical management such as angioplasty, embolectomy and bowel resection."
gastrointestinal system,6,"A 55-year-old woman complains of retrosternal chest pain and dysphagia which is intermittent and unpredictable. The food suddenly sticks in the middle of the chest, but she can clear it with a drink of water and then finish the meal without any further problem. A barium meal shows a ‘corkscrew esophagus’. What is the single most likely cause of dysphagia?",Esophageal candidiasis,Esophageal carcinoma,Esophageal spasm,Pharyngeal pouch,Plummer-vinson syndrome,C,"Chest pain, unpredictable intermittent dysphagia and food suddenly sticks in the middle of the chest which can be cleared with a drink of water indicates uncoordinated irregular esophageal peristalsis which is characteristic of esophageal spasm! Also “cork-screw esophagus” seen in barium swallow is diagnostic of esophageal spasm"
gastrointestinal system,7,"A 28-year-old lady develops abdominal pain, jaundice and ascites worsening over a week. She drinks ten units of alcohol each week and takes the oral contraceptive pill. Which of the following findings would make a diagnosis of hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome [BCS]) most likely?",Acute liver failure,Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 345 U/L (5 - 35),Ankle oedema,Ascites fluid protein of 38 g/L,Tender enlarged liver,E,"The most common causes of an acute severe liver injury in a young woman are:  viruses (including hepatitis A virus [HAV], hepatitis B virus [HBV]) drugs (particularly paracetamol overdose) autoimmune hepatitis  hepatic vein thrombosis (often precipitated by pregnancy or oral contraceptive pill [OCP] use).   The presence of liver failure, ankle oedema, and an exudative ascites do not help differentiate between these aetiologies. The ALT of 345 is moderately elevated and compatible with BCS. With viral or drug-related hepatitis, the peak ALT is usually much higher than this; the ALT may already be on the way down if she has had symptoms for a week. Tender hepatomegaly is one of the hallmarks of BCS. In acute severe viral, autoimmune or drug/toxin related liver disease the necrotic liver decreases in size."
gastrointestinal system,8,Which of the following is consistent with a diagnosis of insulinoma?,"High fasting glucose, low insulin, high C peptide","Low fasting glucose, high insulin, high C peptide","Low fasting glucose, high insulin, low C peptide","Low fasting glucose, low insulin, high C peptide","Low fasting glucose, low insulin, low C peptide",B,"In patients with an insulinoma there is low fasting glucose due to high levels of insulin and C peptide is elevated. Insulinoma is a pancreatic endocrine cell tumour. Patients suffer from recurrent hypoglycaemia due to the secretion of insulin. In contrast, insulin overdose will cause high insulin levels but a low C peptide."
gastrointestinal system,9,A 60-year-old man presents with dysphagia and pain on swallowing both solids and liquids. A barium meal shows gross dilatation of the esophagus with a smooth narrowing at the lower end of the esophagus. What is the SINGLE most likely cause of dysphagia?,Achalasia,Myasthenia gravis,Esophageal carcinoma,Esophageal web,Systemic sclerosis,A,Achalasia Cardia is a primary motility disorder of the esophagus characterized by aperistalsis and defective lower esophageal sphincter relaxation. The pathogenesis of achalasia cardia is poorly understood. However recent evidences indicate that it is an autoimmune process trigerred by some virus (e.g herpes virus) in a genetically predisposed individual resulting in degeneration of myenteric neurons .Dysphagia for both solid and liquid or prominently liquid suggests achalasia where dysphagia to solid suggests stricture. Also gross dilatation of oesophagus with smooth narrowing at lower end is seen in achalasia. In achalasia dysphagia is usually described as progressive. The standard of care in patients with achalasia has been pneumatic balloon dilatation and laparoscopic heller's myotomy. Per oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is an novel minimally invasive treatment option for all types of achalasia cardia
gastrointestinal system,10,Lactulose aids in reducing hepatic encephalopathy. What is the mechanism for this?,Asks as a barrier preventing ammonia absorption,Increased motility,Neutralisation and less absorption of ammonia,Alkalinises the faeces,Osmotic laxative,C,Lactulose is metabolised in the colon by the bacteria leading to lactic acid production. This leads to acidic faecal matter and acidic colonic environment which ultimately leads to neutralisation of ammonia leading to reduced absorption and to an improvement of hepatic encephalopathy.
gastrointestinal system,11,A 45-year-old woman is diagnosed with a duodenal ulcer. Which one of the following is the most sensitive test for detecting current infection with Helicobacter pylori?,Culture of a gastric biopsy,Gastric fundal biopsy,Presence of Helicobacter pylori serum antibodies,The (^13C) urea breath test,Urease test on gastric biopsy,D,"The reference standard for diagnosis of H. pylori when evaluating methods of diagnosing infection is typically culture of a gastric biopsy. Yet this test has an estimated sensitivity of only 72%. The rapid urease test on a biopsy is 80-95% sensitive and 95-100% specific. Histology is 80-90% sensitive and 95% specific. The urease breath test is approximately 95% sensitive and 98-100% specific. Therefore, the most specific and clinically applicable test would be the urease breath test. The presence of IgG antibodies to H. pylori could indicate previous infection. A gastric antral biopsy can give false negative results following PPI treatment."
gastrointestinal system,12,Which single statement is true regarding the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia?,Absorption of iron is increased by ascorbic acid,Ferrous sulphate 200 mg has less elemental iron than the same dose of ferrous gluconate,Iron is absorbed in the distal jejunum,Parenteral iron is indicated when the anaemia responds slowly to oral iron,Sustained release iron is a useful way of giving larger doses,A,Absorption of oral iron is improved by ascorbic acid. Ferrous sulphate has more elemental iron by mass. Iron is absorbed in the upper small intestine. Parenteral iron acts no faster than oral iron. It is indicated when oral iron cannot be tolerated or is not absorbed. Sustained-release preparations may improve tolerance of oral iron but do not aid absorption.
gastrointestinal system,13,Which of the following is true regarding gastric ulceration?,Associated with hypochlorhydria,The commonest cause of upper GI haemorrhage,The most common form of peptic ulceration,Usually benign,Usually associated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,D,"Peptic ulcers are caused by gastric acid and pepsin acting on the mucosa. Eighty percent occur in the duodenum and 20% in the stomach. Most cases are associated with H. pylori (more than 80% with gastric ulcers, 95% with duodenal ulcers). The majority of patients with duodenal ulcers have a high acid output, and the majority with gastric ulcers will have a normal or, sometimes, low acid output. About 1% of patients with H. pylori infection develop a pangastritis and hypochlorhydria which may increase the risk of gastric cancer. Peptic ulceration may present electively with symptoms such as nausea and intermittent epigastric pain, or as an emergency with an acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed or perforation. Duodenal ulcers are the commonest cause of upper GI bleed and may be treated endoscopically or surgically. Ten percent of all gastric ulcers are malignant and a minimum of six biopsies should be taken from the edge of any gastric ulcers seen."
gastrointestinal system,14,A 45-year-old female develops profuse watery diarrhoea with lower abdominal pain seven days after undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Abdominal sepsis,Bile acid diarrhoea,Campylobacter gastroenteritis,Pseudomembranous colitis,Pseudo-obstruction,D,"Prophylactic antibiotics are frequently given in both laparoscopic and open cholecystectomy. Typically broad spectrum antibiotics are administered with a consequent risk of pseudomembranous colitis. However, it must also be remembered that Clostridium difficile may also be contracted on the wards. Bile acid diarrhoea may affect 10% of patients following cholecystectomy. Typically it is post-prandial; the bile, with no gallbladder to store it, is excreted directly into the gut."
gastrointestinal system,15,"A 32-year-old woman has presented to the Emergency Department for the third time with abdominal pain which typically lasts several days. The previous two occasions she has been discharged home without a firm diagnosis. Between episodes, the patient is symptom-free. She complains of feeling anxious. She has recently restarted the combined oral contraceptive pill after completing her family. On examination, she is anxious and hypertensive at 155/98 mmHg with a pulse of 102. She has no rashes. Her abdomen is diffusely tender. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 128 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 8.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 220 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 135 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 100 μmol/L (60-120)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute intermittent porphyria,Appendicitis,Depression,Porphyria cutanea tarda,Variegate porphyria,A,"Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is a rare disorder characterised by abdominal pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms which usually presents in the 20-40 age group. Rash is not a feature of AIP, unlike other porphyrias. Hypertension and tachycardia are common examination findings. The progesterone component of the combined oral contraceptive pill is known to precipitate porphyria attacks. Many other drugs have been described in association with an attack."
gastrointestinal system,16,A 40-year-old woman on chemotherapy for metastatic breast carcinoma now presents with painful swallowing. Examination: she has white plaques on top of friable mucosa in her mouth and more seen on esophagoscopy. What is the most effective treatment for this patient?,Antispasmodic,H2 blocker,Antibiotics,Antifungals,I&D,D,Features are consistent with oesophageal candidiasis which is treated with Oral fluconazole (200-400 mg daily) or IV fluconazole for 14-21 days (here iv fluconazole as patient is immunocompromized due to chemotherapy)
gastrointestinal system,17,A patient known to have systemic sclerosis presents with chronic diarrhoea. How would you manage this?,Codeine Phosphate,Stool culture,Metronidazole,Colonoscopy,Loperamide,C,"Systemic sclerosis are at increased risk of bacterial overgrowth. The bacteria that are involved are usually E. Coli and Bacteroides which can preventing binding of intrinsic factor and thus B12 deficiency as well as interfering with bile salt conjugation. Metronidazole and ciprofloxacin are useful in the management however due to the increased risk of C.diff with ciprofloxacin, metronidazole is often used."
gastrointestinal system,18,An 80-year-old man has had a stroke and has a poor swallow. He keeps pulling his nasogastric tube out and is not adequately nourished. He develops diarrhoea. Stools were examined and show the presence of Clostridium difficile toxin. He has not been treated with antibiotics. What should the next course of action be in this patient?,Arrange a barium enema,Arrange a colonoscopy,Treat with cholestyramine,Treat with loperamide,Treat with metronidazole,E,"Infection with Clostridium difficile is usually established upon exposure to antibiotics. However, it may also occur in debilitated patients who have not been exposed to antibiotics."
gastrointestinal system,19,"A 65-year-old woman presented with a malabsorption syndrome. She had a past history of radiotherapy for cervical cancer. Small intestine biopsy reveals villous atrophy, crypt hypertrophy, and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate of the lamina propria together with an increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial overgrowth,Coeliac disease,Crohn's disease,Mesenteric ischaemia,Radiation enteropathy,B,"These histological features are typical of coeliac disease with:  Villous atrophy Crypt hyperplasia/hypertrophy Inflammatory infiltrate of the lamina propria, and Intra-epithelial lymphocytes.  Useful serology includes anti-TTG antibodies which would be expected in over 90% of cases. Treatment of this case would therefore entail gluten-free diet. "
gastrointestinal system,20,"A 28-year-old woman presented to the gastroenterology clinic with recurrent chest pain. She had these episodes of pain usually while eating and they lasted 5-10 minutes. She also had significant weight loss of 19 kg over the last three months. Recently, she got alarmed when food, both solid and liquid, andquot;seemed to get stuckandquot; inside her chest. What is the best method of diagnosis of this condition?",Barium swallow study,ECG,Echocardiography,Esophageal manometry,Upper GI endoscopy with biopsy,D,"This young woman has dysphagia to both solids and liquids from the start. At this age, achalasia is the most likely diagnosis. Chest pain is also a typical feature of achalasia and results from oesophagal spasm. Regurgitation of food is also a common feature. Oesophageal manometry is the most sensitive test for diagnosis of achalasia Barium swallow study also is used for diagnosing achalasia. But barium swallow study shows dilated oesophagus. Manometry can detect achalasia in the early stage before oesophagal dilatation has occurred. This is not a cardiac condition. Neither ECG nor echocardiography will help in diagnosis, but ECG can help to rule out a cardiac cause. Upper GI endoscopy is not the preferred test for diagnosis of achalasia. It can show residual food particles and a dilated oesophagus, but diagnosis of the pressure alteration requires manometry. However, endoscopy is a necessary part of the diagnostic algorithm to rule out pseudo-achalasia."
gastrointestinal system,21,A 19-year-old student presents with a 15-week history of diarrhoea. He has lost 2 kg in weight and has had no recent travel abroad. A smear of a duodenal biopsy reveals many trophozoites. What is the best treatment option?,Ciprofloxacin,Gluten free diet,Metronidazole,Prednisolone,Quinine,C,The diagnosis here is giardiasis caused by Giardia lamblia. Giardia has been reported as a cause of chronic diarrhoea. Most patients respond to oral metronidazole 250-400 mg tds for five days.
gastrointestinal system,22,A 48-year-old woman is admitted to the emergency department with a productive cough and moderate fever. She often has central chest pain and she regurgitates undigested food most of the time but doesn’t suffer from acid reflux. These symptoms have been present for the last 3.5 months which affects her daily food intake. CXR: air-fluid level behind a normal sized heart. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Pharyngeal pouch,Hiatus hernia,Bulbar palsy,Achalasia,TB,D,Usually in hiatus hernia there is acid reflux
gastrointestinal system,23,Umbilical hernia in early childhood is often associated with which of the following?,Asperger's syndrome,Caucasians,Down syndrome,Simple obesity,Type 1 diabetes mellitus,C,"Umbilical hernia is most common in infants of Afro-Caribbean origin and in prematurity. It is also associated with:  Hypothyroidism Hurler's syndrome, and Down syndrome."
gastrointestinal system,24,A 38-year-old lady presents to the Emergency department with epigastric pain and jaundice. Amylase is 1208 U/L (60-180). Her remaining blood results are as follows:    pO2 12.3 kPa (11.3-12.6)   White cell count 12.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Haemoglobin 11.1 g/L (115-165)   Na 138 mmol/L (137-144)   K 3.8 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 20.5 mmol/L (2.5-7.0)   Creatinine 130 μmol/L (60-110)   Bilirubin 120 μmol/L (1-22)   Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 199 U/L (5-35)   Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) 684 U/L (45-105)   Albumin 40 g/L (37-49)   C Calcium 2.15 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Glucose 7.2 mmol/L (3.3-4.4)   Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 198 U/L (10-250)    What is her Modified Glasgow Pancreatitis Severity Score?,1,2,3,4,5,A,The Glasgow Pancreatitis score is a severity predictive score used in the first 48 hours of onset of acute pancreatitis. It is scored out of 8 and is calculated using the following:    Age greater than55 years 1 point   Serum albumin less than32 g/L (3.2 g/dL) 1 point   Arterial pO2 on room air less than8 kPa (60 mmHg) 1 point   Serum calcium less than2 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) 1 point   Blood glucose greater than10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) 1 point   Serum LDH greater than600 units/L 1 point   Serum urea nitrogen greater than16.1 mmol/L (45 mg/dL) 1 point   White cell count greater than15 ×10^9/L (15 ×10^3/μL) 1 point    A score of 1 or 2 predicts mild pancreatitis. A score of 3 or greater predicts severe pancreatitis. This woman would score 1 based on her high urea of 20.5 mmol/L. The amylase level is not used to calculate the score.
gastrointestinal system,25,For which of the following is an urgent laparotomy performed for children with abdominal injury?,Absence of bowel sounds,Non-penetrating injury,Palpable mass,Refractory shock,Splenic rupture,D,"The following are indications for laparotomy:  Refractory shock Penetrating injury, and Definite signs of bowel perforation.  Absence of bowel sounds can be associated with peritonitis, but in the absence of other abdominal signs then peritonitis is unlikely. A palpable mass may or may not be related to trauma and would require radiological investigations such as ultrasound scan or computerised tomography (CT). Further management would be guided by the results of the imaging. Splenic rupture is usually managed conservatively in children (and increasingly in adults). Nephrectomy is performed for renal pedicle injury leading to non-functioning kidney."
gastrointestinal system,26,A 55-year-old woman is referred by her GP with abnormal liver function tests. She is overweight but otherwise well. Liver biopsy is reported as showing evidence of non-alcoholic steatotic hepatitis (NASH). Which of the following statements is correct concerning NASH?,Commoner in women than men,Has not shown improvement with pioglitazone,Is associated with insulin resistance,Is treated with urso-deoxycholic acid,The majority of patients will develop cirrhosis,C,NASH is associated with increased prevalence of insulin resistance/type 2 diabetes. Approximately 20% develop cirrhosis.^1 It is more common in men due to the protective effects of oestrogen. The treatment is complex and multi-modal but should focus on weight reduction. Data from small clinical trials using pioglitazone have shown modest improvement in liver biopsy appearance over one year. 
gastrointestinal system,27,A 67-year-old man with known aortic valvular disease is admitted with deteriorating dyspnoea. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 90 g/L (120-160)   MCV 70 fL (80-96)         Upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy Normal   Duodenal biopsy Normal    Which one of the following investigations is most likely to provide the diagnosis?,Barium enema,Colonoscopy,CT abdomen,Mesenteric angiography,Small bowel enema,B,"In the older age group, investigation of the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract is vital to exclude a lower GI malignancy. There is an association between aortic stenosis and angiodysplasia; it has been debated and is likely to be present but weak. Angiodysplasia is more common in severe aortic disease and may regress upon treatment of the valvular lesion. There is evidence that angiodysplasia is more frequently present in patients with aortic stenosis compared to those with other valvular dysfunction, and also that patients with aortic stenosis are over-represented in those with occult GI bleeding. This, however, does not extrapolate to mean that angiodysplasia is the most common underlying lesion in patients with aortic stenosis and GI bleeding. Colonoscopy would have the greatest diagnostic yield in this setting. After this, capsule endoscopy would probably be the most appropriate. Mesenteric angiography may be useful if there is active bleeding; generally, a large arteriovenous malformation or a bleeding rate of at least 0.5 ml/min is required to obtain a diagnostic scan. CT scans do not demonstrate colonic pathology as well as colonoscopy, which is still considered the gold standard."
gastrointestinal system,28,Which of the following is most commonly associated with the development of pseudomembranous colitis?,Cefuroxime,Co-trimoxazole,Erythromycin,Flucloxacillin,Gentamicin,A,"Clostridium difficile, a Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium, is the cause of pseudomembranous colitis. Studies show that when C. difficile colonise the gut they release two potent toxins, toxin A and toxin B, which bind to certain receptors in the lining of the colon and ultimately cause diarrhoea and inflammation of the large intestine or colon (colitis). Commonly the disease is caused by broad-spectrum antibiotics, most commonly cephalosporins, broad-spectrum penicillins, quinolones, and clindamycin. Less commonly, macrolides, trimethoprim and sulphonamides have been reported to cause the disorder. Aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, and chloramphenicol are rarely associated with pseudomembranous colitis. Appropriate treatment includes metronidazole and oral vancomycin. "
gastrointestinal system,29,The following laboratory results were returned in a 6-week-old boy admitted with six days of severe projectile vomiting:    pH 7.51 (7.36-7.44)   PO2 12 KPa/95 mmHg (11.3-12.6)   PCO2 4.7 KPa/35 mmHg (4.7-6.0)   Blood Urea 11 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Na^+ 131 mmol/L (137-144)   K^+ 3 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Chloride 83 mmol/L (95-107)    Which of the following is true concerning this patient?,An x ray of the abdomen is likely to show dilated loops of small bowel,He has respiratory alkalosis,He is likely to have a bulging anterior fontanelle,"He should be commenced immediately on half strength soy protein, low lactose formula",He should be resuscitated immediately with normal saline,E,"He has a metabolic, rather than respiratory alkalosis as CO2 is not reduced. He is likely to have a sunken fontanelle as he is very dehydrated. Pyloric stenosis would highly likely because of the age and hypochloraemic, hypokalaemic metabolic alkalosis. This characteristic biochemical picture arises due to high sodium and proton (H+) losses from gastric fluids and compensatory increased renal potasium excretion to conserve H+. He should be resuscitated with normal saline first. Dilated bowel would not be expected, as pyloric rather than small bowel obstruction is present."
gastrointestinal system,30,A child presents with increasing jaundice and pale stools. Choose the most appropriate test?,US abdomen,Sweat test,TFT,LFT,Endomyseal antibodies,A,"This is a picture suggestive of obstructive jaundice. LFT can give clue like much raised bilirubin, AST and ALT not that high and raised alkaline phosphatase but still USG is diagnostic in case of obstructive jaundice"
gastrointestinal system,31,Which electrolyte abnormality is commonly seen in pyloric stenosis?,Acid urine,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperchloraemia,Hyperkalaemia,Metabolic acidosis,A,"Pyloric stenosis is the most common congenital obstruction of the stomach and intestines. It occurs in 1:150 males and 1:175 females. It affects first born males more commonly and has a high concordance rate among monozygotic twins. The main presenting complaint is that of projectile vomiting, which typically starts in the second or third week of life. The vomitus is not bile stained, as the condition is caused by the hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the antrum of the stomach. Babies with this condition are usually hungry and usually suck well.They often appear wasted and have the appearance of an old man. Electrolyte abnormalities are common with the patient often showing the following:  hyponatraemia hypokalaemia, and a profound hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis."
gastrointestinal system,32,A 14-year-old boy attends the clinic with a first episode of painless jaundice after a bout of gastroenteritis. His bilirubin is elevated at 68 µmol/L (1-22) but the remainder of the liver function was normal. His reticulocyte count is normal. What is the likely diagnosis?,Choledocholithiasis,Gilbert's syndrome,Haemolytic anaemia,Hepatoblastoma,Viral hepatitis,B,"The boy is likely to have Gilbert's syndrome. This is a congenital unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia due to a defect in glucuronosyl transferase activity and affects 2-5% of the population. Patients are usually well, but notice the appearance of jaundice after a relatively minor illness. In the case of common duct stones a pattern of deranged LFTs would be expected and pain is common. The normal reticulocyte count excludes a diagnosis of a haemolylic anaemia. Hepatoblastoma usually presents as a mass without deranged liver function tests (LFTs). Viral hepatitis would be expected to exhibit raised liver enzyme levels."
gastrointestinal system,33,A 28-year-old female presents with 1 week history of jaundice and 2 days history of altered sleep pattern and moods. She was diagnosed with hypothyroidism for which she is receiving thyroxine. TFT showed increased TSH. PT (prothrombin time) 70s. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Acute on chronic liver failure,Hyper-acute liver failure,Autoimmune hepatitis,Acute liver failure,Drug induced hepatitis,C,"Autoimmune hepatitis may present as acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, or well-established cirrhosis. Autoimmune hepatitis rarely presents as fulminant hepatic failure. One third may present as acute hepatitis marked by fever, hepatic tenderness and jaundice. Non specific features are anorexia, weight loss and behavioural change (here altered sleep pattern and moods). There may be coagulopathy (here PT 70s.) leading to epistaxis, gum bleeding etc. Presence of other autoimmune disease like hypothyroidism supports the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis"
gastrointestinal system,34,"A 24-year-old woman has ingested an unknown quantity of paracetamol tablets four hours ago. She now presents with nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and right subchondral pain. Which of the following features suggest that she should be transferred to the liver unit?",ALT 800 units/L,Blood glucose 5 mmol/L,Heart rate 120 BPM,pH 7.25,Systolic BP 100 mmHg,D,"A pH of less than 7.3 is a poor prognostic factor for this patient. The criteria for transfer to a specialist unit are:  encephalopathy INR: greater than2.0 at less than48 hours, or greater than3.5 at less than72 hours serum creatinine: greater than200 μmol/L blood pH: less than7.3 systolic BP: less than80 mmHg."
gastrointestinal system,35,"With respect to gastric carcinoma, which of the following statements is true?",Aspirin use is a risk factor for gastric carcinoma,Early diagnosis of gastric carcinoma results in a five-year survival rate of 20%,Endoscopic ultrasonography is superior to conventional CT scanning for local tumour staging,Helicobacter pylori infection is not associated with gastric carcinoma,Incidence of distal stomach tumours is increasing,C,"The incidence of distal stomach tumours is actually decreasing while the incidence of tumours in the proximal stomach is increasing. NSAID use is associated with decreased risk of certain gastric tumours. H. pylori infection has been associated in a number of studies with increased risk of gastric carcinoma. Screening for gastric carcinoma in Japan detects up to 40% of gastric carcinomas at an early stage and in skilled hands, five-year survival can be upwards of 90%. CT with gastric dilatation is a useful complementary investigation in the staging of gastric carcinoma but endoscopic ultrasonography is superior to conventional CT scanning as it is able to assess depth of infiltration and lymphatic dissemination of tumour.

gastrointestinal system,36,A 44-year-old gentleman with dyspepsia associated with H. pylori was recently treated with triple therapy. He returns to your clinic for follow up to ensure the infection has been cleared. Which is the most appropriate test to confirm eradication?,Endoscopic biopsy culture,H.pylori antigen on blood sample,Rapid urease test during endoscopy,Stool sample for H.pylori antigen,Urea breath test,E,"The gold standard test for confirming Helicobacter pylori eradication is the urea breath test. Patients swallow urea labelled with a carbon isotope. If H. pylori is present in the stomach, its urease enzyme splits the urea and isotope-labelled carbon dioxide is present in the patient's exhaled breath (within 10-30 m). This can be measured either by scintillation or mass spectrometry depending on the carbon isotope used. A baseline breath sample is also required from the patient. Patients should have stopped antibiotics at least four weeks prior to the test being done, and proton pump inhibitors at least two weeks prior. The test has high sensitivity (95-98%) and high specificity (98%) for confirming H. pylori eradication.  The rapid urease test requires a biopsy sample (taken at OGD) and has a lower sensitivity. Serum antibody will remain positive after eradication and has a lower sensitivity and specificity as well. Culture of gastric biopsy has a higher specificity (100%) but is less sensitive and more invasive. It is used more commonly when testing antibiotic sensitivity in H. pylori which is resistant to initial triple therapy. Stool sample is less specific and sensitive than the urea breath test."
gastrointestinal system,37,A newborn is noted to have an umbilical hernia. Which of the following is associated with umbilical hernia?,Congenital hypoparathyroidism,Down syndrome,Infants of diabetic mothers,Post-term delivery,Turner's syndrome,B,"Umbilical hernias occur more frequently in infants of Afro-American descent, premature babies and females. The vast majority of umbilical hernias are not related to any disease condition. However, umbilical hernias can be associated with rare diseases, such as:  Mucopolysaccharide storage diseases Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome Down syndrome, and congenital hypothyroidism."
gastrointestinal system,38,"A 19 year old presents with a 2 month history of bloody diarrhoea, urgency, tenesmus and crampy abdominal pain. A colonoscopy is performed and reveals superficial ulceration with a friable mucosa and biopsy shows goblet cell depletion and crypt abscesses. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Whipples disease,Crohn's Disease,Coeliac Disease,Gastroenteritis,Ulcerative colitis,E,"The clinical features and biopsy findings are characteristic of Ulcerative colitis. In crohn's disease there is typically transmural inflammation, non caseating granulomas and goblet cells are present."
gastrointestinal system,39,A 62-year-old man with a change in bowel habit is being investigated for a suspected bowel tumour. Which of the following is true of colorectal cancer?,Affects females more commonly than males,Risk is associated with the decreased intake of dietary fat,Risk is elevated in patients with a low BMI,Risk is elevated in postmenopausal females taking hormone replacement therapy,Risk is higher in lower social classes,E,"Colorectal carcinoma is the fourth most common cancer in males and females and affects the sexes equally. No specific difference in incidence has been identified between the sexes and there is an increased risk with obesity and smoking. Dietary fat and lower social class have been implicated. Although breast cancer risk increases with HRT use, the Women's Health Initiative showed a reduced incidence of colorectal cancer associated with HRT use."
gastrointestinal system,40,A 50-year-old male with a history of alcohol excess presents with a two-week history of confusion. Which of the following strongly suggests a diagnosis of Korsakoff's psychosis?,Delusional jealous beliefs,Epileptic seizures,Impaired long term memory,Inventing recent events,Visual hallucinations,D,Korsakoff's is associated with short term memory loss with subsequent compensatory confabulation by the patient. Other symptoms may include  Delirium Anxiety Fear Depression Confusion Delusions Insomnia Painful extremities Sometimes bilateral wrist drop but more frequently bilateral foot drop with pain or pressure over the long nerves.  The treatment is intravenous thiamine and attention to the consequences of alcohol withdrawal.
gastrointestinal system,41,Which of the following genotypes is associated with the lowest levels of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT)?,PiMM,PiMS,PiMZ,PiSZ,PiZZ,E,PiMM is the normal phenotype. The null phenotype (not in the list of options) is the least common but the most severe form of the disease where there is no detectable AAT in the serum.
gastrointestinal system,42,A 29-year-old man presents with severe gastro-oesophageal reflux. A small hiatus hernia is seen at endoscopy. Which course of action is the most useful in assessing the role of surgery in this patient?,Barium swallow,Gastric emptying studies,Intragastric pH monitoring off therapy,Oesophageal motility study,Oesophageal pH monitoring on therapy,E,"Laparoscopic fundoplication is the treatment of choice for patients with GORD refractory to, or intolerant of, proton pump inhibitor therapy. An oesophageal pH study will establish physiological response to PPI treatment. The patient should have had an endoscopy at least six months prior to surgery to exclude any unsuspected pathology such as Barrett's oesophagus or adenocarcinoma. An oesophageal transit study is indicated to rule out a primary motor disorder (for example, achalasia, scleroderma) when suspected and to rule out aperistalsis, which may result in postoperative dysphagia after some forms of fundoplication."
gastrointestinal system,43,A 78-year-old woman with hip osteoarthritis presents with altered bowel habit. She undergoes a sigmoidoscopy and rectal biopsy shows normal epithelium and pigment-laden macrophages in the lamina propria. What is the most likely cause of these findings?,Diverticular disease,Laxative use,Mesenteric ischaemia,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,Ulcerative colitis,B,She has 'melanosis coli' as a result of prolonged laxative use. Often the bowel mucosa looks dark and 'stained' during colonoscopy. She may be predisposed to constipation due to immobility from her arthritis and/or use of constipating pain killers.
gastrointestinal system,44,"A 19 year old female presents with a few month history of abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea and weight loss.  She has noticed on a few occasions redness of her eye causing some discomfort and bruise like lesions on her shins. A colonoscopy is performed and reveals a cobblestone appearance.  Which of the following would you not expect to find on biopsy?",Transmural inflammation,Goblet cells present,Skip lesions,Non caseating granulomas,Goblet cell depletion,E,The history in indicative of Crohns disease.  All of the features are evident on biopsy however in ulcerative colitis there is goblet cell depletion and evidence of crypt abscesses.
gastrointestinal system,45,"A 43-year-old gentleman presents to the Emergency department with severe stabbing type of pain over the epigastric region. The pain started following episodes of repeated vomiting and it worsens on swallowing. He is a heavy drinker and has been consuming 10-15 units of alcohol every day for the past 20 years. On examination, his blood pressure is 100/78 mmHg, and his pulse is 124/min and thready. Chest x ray reveals air in the mediastinum and in the subcutaneous tissues. There is no change in the anatomical contour of the diaphragm. What is the most appropriate cause for this patient's signs and symptoms?",Acute cholecystitis,Boerhaave's syndrome,Diaphramatic rupture,Myocardial contusion,Traumatic haemothorax,B,"Boerhaave's syndrome is the spontaneous rupture of a non-diseased oesophagus, usually caused after episodes of vigorous vomiting. It is seen in patients who consume excessive amounts of alcohol. The dramatically raised intra-oesophageal pressure caused by vigorous vomiting (and associated failure of relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter) may lead to sudden spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus. It is vital to recognise this condition since delay in diagnosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The signs and symptoms include:  Sudden pain in the thorax and epigastrium following forceful protracted vomiting Pain radiating to the neck Progressive dyspnoea Tachypnoea Cyanosis, and Shock.  The x ray shows an abnormal left cardiac border with free fluid within the left hemithorax (pleural effusion). Physical examination usually is non specific; however, subcutaneous emphysema may be present, palpable in the neck or chest. This sign may take an hour to develop after injury. The triad of vomiting, chest pain, and subcutaneous emphysema is also known as 'Mackler triad'; however, this should not always be relied on since only one or two of the above symptoms may be present in a majority of patients in the early stages. Patients may appear acutely ill with tachycardia and tachypnoea. Fever, sepsis and gross hypotension may be seen in patients with delayed presentation. Examination of chest may reveal decreased breath sounds on the side of perforation, usually the left. A crunching sound (known as Hamman's sign) may be heard with each heartbeat in up to 20% of cases."
gastrointestinal system,46,How should you manage a patient with ascites?,Ultrasound,Ensure renal function satisfactory and ascites not tense and introduce furosemide,Ensure renal function satisfactory and ascites not tense and introduce spironolactone,Low salt diet,Paracentesis for all patients initially,C,In patients who have normal renal function and whose ascites are not causing significant discomfort then spironolactone can be introduced and titrated up. Spironolactone should be utilised as it counteracts one of the mechanism thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of ascites. Furosemide can be utilised if there is significant peripheral oedema. Renal function should be monitored and daily weights. If the patient is very tight and uncomfortable then an ascitic drain is indicated as long as PT is normal. Some patients are refractory to diuretic treatment or their renal function is not tolerant and regular paracentesis is required. A low salt diet is useful.
gastrointestinal system,47,"A 52 year old female presents with increasing fatigue over the last few months.  She has also noticed pains in the joints of his fingers.  She has noticed she is irritable and is having severe mood swings.  Recently her periods have stopped.  She has also noticed being thirsty and increased urinary frequency.  On examination she appears very tanned and there is evidence of hepatomegaly.  Given the most likely diagnosis, what is most useful for monitoring response to treatment?",Transferrin saturation,Glucose,Haemoglobin,Ferritin,CRP,D,The most likely diagnosis is haemochromatosis.  There is evidence of liver disease and pigmentation which is highly suggestive of this.  Arthralgia especially in the hands can occur de to iron deposition.  Deposition of iron can also lead to hypogonadism and amenorrhoea.  She is also showing symptoms of diabetes mellitus (polyuria and polydipsia) which is another feature secondary to pancreatic involvement.  Haemochromatosis is due to genetic mutation of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 which leads to excessive iron absorption.  It is an autosomal recessive inheritance and the known mutations are C282Y and H63D.  A transferrin saturation of >50% is indicative of iron accumulation and genetic testing for HFE mutations.  Ferritin is also raised but this can be raised in other conditions but is useful for monitoring in venesection.  Also ferritin does not always rise until later on in the disease as it will not rise until liver concentrations are increased.  Venesection should be commenced to reduced iron overload.  Ferritin is more useful for monitoring response to venesection as ferritin decreases steadily whilst transferrin saturation remains raised and only falls when iron deficiency occurs.  It is therefore recommended to monitor ferritin monthly and then measure transferrin saturation once ferritin is <50 microgram/L.  Haemoglobin should also be monitored.
gastrointestinal system,48,"A 40-year-old man has a history of left-sided Crohn's colitis. Although previously treated with steroids and mesalazine, he has had several relapses in the past year. The last relapse, treated with high doses of steroids, was complicated by gastric bleeding secondary to steroid use. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 108 g/L (130-180)   MCV 76 fL (80-96)   MCH 24 pg (28-32)   White cell count 10 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 400 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum total protein 70 g/L (61-76)   Serum albumin 30 g/L (37-49)   Serum CRP 30 mg/L (less than10)    Abdominal x ray is normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",A trial of oral metronidazole for three months.,Total colectomy with ileostomy construction.,Total colectomy with pouch construction.,Treatment with azathioprine.,Treatment with oral budesonide.,D,"This patient has all the hallmarks of active Crohn's colitis that is failing to settle with first-line medical therapy. The next step is a trial of azathioprine which is used as a steroid-sparing agent. This is particularly relevant to this particular patient as he has had a serious side effect from previous steroid treatment. Metronidazole is rarely effective in the treatment of active Crohn's colitis. Given that Crohn's disease can recur following surgery, an operation should not be embarked upon without first a trial of the second line medical therapies such as azathioprine, its metabolite 5-mercaptopurine, or infliximab."
gastrointestinal system,49,Which of the following features of colonic adenoma is associated with increased risk of malignant transformation?,Rapid growth,No family history,Villous Adenoma,Polyp <1 cm in size,Tubular Adenoma,C,Polyps that are sessile or flat and those with villous architecture rather than tubular architecture are at increased risk of malignant transformation. Similarly once the size exceeds 1 cm there is an increased risk. If a patient has multiple polyps or has Familial Adenosis Polyposis or Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer there are also at a much greater risk.
gastrointestinal system,50,Which of the following electrolyte disturbances are seen in patients with gastric outflow obstruction?,Hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis,Hyperchloraemic metabolic alkalosis,Hypochloraemic metabolic acidosis,Hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis,None of the above,D,"Patients with gastric outflow obstruction and recurrent vomiting may have electrolyte disturbance such as hypokalaemia or a hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. The pathophysiology of the biochemical abnormalities seen with gastric outflow obstruction is due to persistent vomiting of gastric hydrochloric acid which in turn leads to hypochloraemia and metabolic alkalosis. With worsening dehydration the metabolic disturbance becomes more severe with compromised renal function. In the early stages the urine has low chloride and high bicarbonate levels in order to compensate for the loss of gastric hydrochloric acid and is appropriately alkaline. With the continued dehydration, sodium is preferentially reabsorbed over the potassium and hydrogen ions which are excreted by the kidneys. The urine becomes paradoxically acidic, hypokalaemia develops, and alkalosis leads to lower circulating levels of ionised calcium. Anaemia can be seen in patients where the underlying cause includes peptic ulcer disease, malignant disease or large gastric polyps. "
gastrointestinal system,51,"A 52 year old gentleman undergoes a colonoscopy due to the finding of blood in his stools. The colonoscopy revealed four polyps which were variable in size from one at 0.5cm, 2 at approximately 1.5cm and one at 2 cm. When should this patient have a follow up colonoscopy?",3 years,6 months,1 year,5 years,3 months,A,"Based on the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines this patient is at medium risk due to the fact he has three to four adenomas with three of them being larger than 1cm, a three year follow up period is recommended."
gastrointestinal system,52,Which of the following contributes the most to weight loss in colorectal cancer?,Chemotherapy,Diarrhoea,TNF a,Depression,Anorexia,E,Anorexia contributes the most.
gastrointestinal system,53,"An elderly woman is found anemic. As part of her examination, she had a barium enema which reveals a mass lesion in the ascending colon. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?",Sigmoid volvulus,Anal fissure,Sigmoid carcinoma,Cecal carcinoma,Diverticular disease,D,Mass in assending colon and anaemia makes cecal carcinoma the likely diagnosis from the given options
gastrointestinal system,54,"A 25-year-old man with a long history of heavy alcohol intake is admitted with nausea and frequent vomiting, four hours after a meal in a restaurant. During review in the Emergency Department, he vomits a cupful of blood. Which if the following is the cause of his haematemesis?",Duodenal ulceration,Haemorrhagic gastritis,Mallory-Weiss tear,Oesophageal varices,Oesophagitis,C,"Persistent vomiting can eventually lead to small tears in the oesophagus, leading to the vomiting of red blood. Varices would produce large volumes of blood (much more than just a cupful)."
gastrointestinal system,55,A 24-year-old woman who has a long history of ulcerative colitis and takes mesalazine 3 g and azathioprine 125 mg per day discovers that she is 10 weeks pregnant. She is also a smoker of 15 cigarettes daily. She attends clinic seeking advice on the management of her medicines during her pregnancy. Which of the following statements is correct?,Azathioprine can be used in pregnancy without significant risk to the fetus,Initiating an elemental diet predisposes to fetal malnutrition,Mesalazine therapy should be withdrawn,Steroid therapy is contraindicated,Termination of the pregnancy is advised,A,"Azathioprine use for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease in pregnancy is not associated with a significant increase in complications of pregnancy, nor fetal malformations, and its use in this setting is considered safe. Animal studies suggest an increased risk of low birth weight but this is not supported by the data available in humans. The risk to the fetus from uncontrolled inflammatory bowel disease is significant and maintenance of remission is very important. Well-controlled ulcerative colitis is more important for the baby from a nutritional point of view. An elemental diet simply contains predigested food and would not lead to fetal malnutrition. The safety of the 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs in pregnancy is best supported by the data on Salazopyrin which have been available for the longest."
gastrointestinal system,56,A 40 year old gentleman presents with a dysphagia to both solids and liquids. He sometimes regurgitates his food. He has not lost any weight. You organise a barium swallow which reveals a dilated oesophagus with a narrowing at the end of the oesophagus. What is the most appropriate long term management of the most likely diagnosis?,Balloon dilatation,Oesophagectomy,Nifedipine,Botox Injection,Isosorbide mononitrate,A,The likely diagnosis is achalasia due to the history and barium swallow findings. The best option here for long term management is balloon dilatation. Nifedipine and ISMN have been used as medical management and there is some short term improvement with these.
gastrointestinal system,57,"A 30-year-old lady complains of intermittent diarrhea, chronic abdominal and pelvic pain and tenesmus. Sometimes she notices blood in her stool. Select the most likely cause leading to her symptoms?",Inflammatory bowel disease,Diverticulosis,Irritable bowel disease,Adenomyosis,UTI,A,"In diverticulosis there is usually constipation and diarrhea is less common. But in IBD there is usually diarrhea. Occasional blood in stool excludes irritable bowel disease. Adenomyosis can cause menstrual cramps, lower abdominal pressure, and bloating before menstrual periods and can result in heavy periods. UTI does not present like this. Answer is IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"
gastrointestinal system,58,"The mother of a 3-year-old, newly diagnosed with coeliac disease, comes to see you about her diet. Which one of the following foods is compatible with her gluten free diet?",Baked beans,Chips cooked in the same fat as battered fish,Ready grated cheese,Soy sauce,Stock cubes,A,"Regarding coeliac disease, there are certain items that contain gluten that may not at first be obvious and should thus be avoided. These include:  Baking powder Stock cubes Mustard powder Packet suet Ready-grated cheese Soy sauce Dry-roasted nuts Food that has been deep-fried with other gluten-containing foods Processed meats Flavoured crisps Malted milk drinks, and Pick-and-mix sweets.  However, many ingredients are safe. Naturally gluten-free cereals include:  Rice flour Tapioca flour Potato flour Corn flour Cornmeal Soya flour Gram flour, and Buckwheat flour.  There are a number of others but these are the most widely available."
gastrointestinal system,59,A 35-year-old woman with a history of recurrent anaemia was noted to have target cells and Howell-Jolly bodies on a blood film examination. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 70 g/L (115-165)   MCV 77 fL (80-96)   MCH 26.2 pg (28-32)   Serum B12 140 µg/L (160-760)   Red cell folate 95 µg/L (160-640)   Serum ferritin 10 µg/L (15-300)    Which disease-specific antibody is most likely to be present?,Anti-gastric parietal cell,Anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase,Anti-intrinsic factor,Anti-mitochondrial,Anti-tissue transglutaminase,E,"The patient has hyposplenism as suggested by the blood film and a mixed anaemia. Coeliac disease could, therefore, fit the above picture with anti-TTG antibodies being the most appropriate selection from the above list.  Anti-mitochonrial antibodies are seen in PBC. Anti-gastric and anti-intrinsic Abs are seen in pernicious anaemia. Anti-GAD abs are found in auto-immune DM.  Screening for coeliac disease should include high-risk groups such as anaemia (iron or folate deficiency), hyposplenism, reduced bone density, and infertility."
gastrointestinal system,60,A 43-year-old man with known chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol is admitted to hospital with confusion. He is currently taking spironolactone 400 mg and furosemide 40 mg in addition to several vitamin supplements. On examination there are peripheral stigmata of chronic liver disease and shifting dullness can be elicited. His pulse rate is 102 beats per minute and blood pressure 95/40 mmHg. His blood tests show:    Sodium 118 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 8.4 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 87 µmol/L (60-110)    According to the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of ascites what is the most appropriate way to manage this gentleman's hyponatraemia?,Fluid restrict,No change in current management,Reduce diuretics,Stop diuretics,Stop diuretics and give normal saline,E,"Patients with chronic liver disease and ascites often develop hyponatraemia, the management of which can be difficult. Diuretic therapy for the management of ascites often contributes to the hyponatraemia. The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines suggest that where the serum sodium is ≤120 mmol/L diuretic therapy should be stopped and patients should receive volume expansion with colloid or normal saline. These guidelines also advise that fluid restriction should only be used in patients who are clinically euvolaemic, not on diuretics and have severe hyponatraemia with a normal serum creatinine. No specific intervention other than careful monitoring is advised where the serum sodium is 126-135 mmol/L. In the range 121-125 mmol/L where the serum creatinine is normal, diuretic therapy may be continued but may need to be reduced with a view to stopping if necessary. If the sodium is in this range but the serum creatinine is rising diuretics should be stopped and patients should receive volume expansion. "
gastrointestinal system,61,A 58-year-old man undergoes a liver resection for a colorectal metastasis. On the second postoperative day he was noted to be hypophosphataemic despite having a normal phosphate level pre-operatively. What is the most likely cause?,Enteral nutrition,Haemolysis,Hepatic failure,Ischaemic bowel,Renal failure,C,"Hypophosphataemia is a common finding after liver resection (including partial resection for transplantation) in patients with normal renal function. It was believed that the low phosphate was due to hepatic regeneration but recent evidence now suggests that it is due to renal loss (hyperphosphaturia), although the mechanism is uncertain. It may also occur after kidney transplantation. In hepatic failure alkaline phosphatase levels are also elevated. The other options all cause elevated levels of phosphate. Enteral feeding of malnourished patients has been associated with hypophosphataemia but this does not appear to be causal (Fuentes E et al. Hypophosphatemia in enterally fed patients in the surgical intensive care unit. Nutrition Surg Pract 2017; 32 (2): 252-257)."
gastrointestinal system,62,Mutation of STK11/LKB1 gene is associated with which of the following diseases?,Familial adenomatous polyposis,Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer,Neurofibromatosis,Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,Tuberous sclerosis,D,"Mutation of APC gene leads to familial adenomatous polyposis. Defective mismatch repair genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 leads to hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. Mutation of tumour suppressor genes NF1 (neurofibromin) and NF2 (merlin) results in neurofibromatosis type 1 and type 2, respectively. In tuberous sclerosis, there is mutation of TSC1 or TSC2 genes. "
gastrointestinal system,63,A 55-year-old alcoholic presents with an acute episode of severe abdominal pain and jaundice. Bloods show the following:    Sodium 136mmol/L (135-145mmol/L)   Potassium 4.6mmol/L (3.5-4.9mmol/L)   Creatinine 119μmol/L (60-110μmol/L)   Urea 8.1mmol/L (2.5-7.5mmol/L)   Adjusted calcium 2.18mmol/L (2.2-2.6mmol/L)   ALT 58U/L (7-55U/L)   ALP 116U/L (45-115U/L)   Bilirubin 53μmol/L (less than22μmol/L)   Albumin 30g/L (35-55g/L)   Haemoglobin 104g/L (115-140g/L)   White cell count 5 ×109/L (4-11 ×109/L)   MCV 102 fl (80-96fl)   Platelets 170 ×109/L (150-400 ×109/L)   Neutrophils 5.3 ×109/L (1.8-8 ×109/L)   CRP 30g/L (less than5g/L)   Amylase 700U/L (25-110U/L)     On examination there is minor hepatomegaly but no splenomegaly.  The patient also reports dark urine.  What is the most likely underlying diagnosis?,Acute pancreatitis,Gallstones,Intravascular haemolysis,Liver cirrhosis,Pancreatic cancer,A,"Alcohol abuse is a risk factor for the development of acute pancreatitis, which typically presents with severe epigastric pain. There is acute inflammation of the pancreas, which results in release of exocrine enzymes that cause auto-digestion. Serum amylase is classically raised three or more times normal, and hypocalcaemia is relatively common.  Raised bilirubin and/or serum aminotransferase suggest underlying gallstones. Pancreatic cancer tends to be relatively asymptomatic in its initial stages, but can then result in obstructive jaundice as the mass enlarges (i.e. you would expect a more raised bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase). Cirrhosis results in a small shrunken liver, and raised ALT and ALP (and gamma-GT if the cause is alcohol). His mild hepatomegaly may be due to fatty liver disease rather than cirrhosis in this case Intravascular haemolysis would cause anaemia and a raised bilirubin.  "
gastrointestinal system,64,A 45 year old gentleman presents with rectal bleeding. He also describes tenesmus. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed and reveals an erythematous and friable mucosa with some superficial ulceration. Biopsies are taken. How should this patient be managed initially?,Prednisolone,Oral Mesalazine,Rectal prednisolone,Rectal mesalazine,IV hydrocortisone,D,This patient has proctitis variant of ulcerative colitis. Rectal treatments are therefore more appropriate and it has been shown that rectal mesalazine is more effective than rectal steroids.
gastrointestinal system,65,A 60-year-old man presented with a lump in the left supraclavicular region. His appetite is decreased and he has lost 5 kg recently. What is the most probably diagnosis?,Thyroid carcinoma,Stomach carcinoma,Bronchial carcinoma,Mesothelioma,Laryngeal carcinoma,B,"Mentioned lump in the left supraclavicular region is Vershow’sgland, has long been regarded as strongly indicative of the presence of cancer in the abdomen, specifically gastric cancer"

What is the next therapy you would introduce?,Infliximab,Referral for colectomy,Methotrexate,Azathioprine,Elemental diet,D,In Crohns disease which has failed to respond to steroids and mesalazine the next recommended treatment is azathioprine.
gastrointestinal system,67,"A 75-year-old male presents with a two-month history of dyspnoea, weight loss and generalised lethargy. His medical history included a previous left-sided hemiparesis due to stroke for which he took aspirin and perindopril. Examination revealed residual left-sided hemiparesis together with a pale and slightly jaundiced appearance. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 50 g/L (130-180)   MCV 109 fL (80-96)   White cell count 2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 45 ×10^9/L (150-400)    Urinalysis showed increased urobilinogen. Which of the following is the next most appropriate investigation?",Bone marrow aspirate,Direct antiglobulin test,Endoscopy,Serum haptoglobins,Vitamin B12 concentration,E,"In this situation, serum B12 estimation is the correct choice. With a pancytopenic picture and raised mean corpuscular volume (MCV), the most appropriate step is to check the B12 and folate. The other choices are considered only after the basic assays. Haemolysis does not explain the low WCC, nor the thrombocytopenia. A haptoglobin only adds weight to a diagnosis of haemolysis, and an RBC-labelled scan would add greater sensitivity to the diagnosis of haemolysis. The mild jaundice is typical of megaloblastic anaemia (vitamin B12 or folate deficiency) because of increased destruction of red cell precursors in the bone marrow."
gastrointestinal system,68,Which of the following is correct regarding infection with Salmonella typhi?,Children are particularly likely to become carriers,Faecal culture is almost always positive during the first week of illness,Most carriers are female,Relapse does not occur if antibiotics are taken for two weeks,Vaccinated individuals who develop the disease will have a mild illness,C,Children are rarely chronic carriers of the organism although for some unknown reason females are more commonly long term carriers than males (remember Typhoid Mary). Faecal culture is positive in only 50% of cases during the first week of illness. The gallbladder may act as a reservoir of infection and cause relapse in individuals treated with antibiotics. Cholecystectomy may be indicated. Vaccinated individuals who develop the disease will have a higher threshold for devleoping the disease but the same disease proess if they are bacteraemic.
gastrointestinal system,69,"A 63-year-old patient with known alcohol-related cirrhosis presented with ascites, abdominal tenderness, and peripheral oedema. A diagnostic tap revealed a neutrophil count of 400/mm^3 (less than250/mm^3). Which of the following would be of most immediate benefit?",Fluid restriction and a no added salt diet,Intravenous antibiotics,Oral spironolactone,Therapeutic paracentesis,Trans-jugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt,B,"This man has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). Appropriate treatment is IV antibiotics. He is likely to have a decreased intravascular volume and require IV albumin as volume expansion. Fluid restriction, diuretics, or large volume paracentesis are likely to cause further hypovolaemia and precipitate renal failure. There is no stated indication for a TIPSS, indications are:  diuretic resistant ascites intractable portal hypertensive bleeding, and hepato-renal failure."
gastrointestinal system,70,"A 52 year old gentleman presents with lethargy, night sweats and pyrexia of unknown origin. He has a history of hypertension and is currently on ramipril. He recently has had dental treatment. On examination he is found to have a murmur and is pyrexial. An echo confirms evidence of vegetation and blood cultures reveal S. bovis. What is the most likely source of the infection?",Hepatic Biliary system,Gallbladder,A dental source,Small intestine,The Colon,E,S. bovis endocarditis is associated with colorectal cancer and this is the most likely source of infection and thus a colonoscopy must be performed. The Hepatic biliary system can also be a source of S. bovis although is less common.
gastrointestinal system,71,"A 72-year-old male with moderate chronic obstructive airways disease, treated with inhaled bronchodilators and oral steroids, presents with a sudden onset of severe epigastric pain. He was recovering from a fractured ankle, for which he had been taking high-dose ibuprofen. Examination reveals a generalised tender abdomen and absent bowel signs on auscultation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cholecystitis,Inferior myocardial infarction,Lower lobe pneumonia,Pancreatitis,Perforated peptic ulcer,E,"The classic presentation of a perforated peptic ulcer is a sudden onset of epigastric pain and peritonitis (usually upper abdominal). In elderly patients, especially on steroids, there may be an absence of symptoms and signs initially. The diagnosis is aided by the signs of gas under the diaphragm on an erect chest radiograph, although this may be absent. Radiological investigations where water-soluble contrasts are given orally also aid the diagnosis, but may also be negative if the ulcer has sealed. The risk factors for peptic ulceration include:  Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs Steroids, and Helicobacter pylori infection.  The optimum management is resuscitation, laparotomy and repair of the ulcer with an omental patch, and peritoneal lavage."
gastrointestinal system,72,At what threshold is hypertriglyceridaemia considered a risk factor for pancreatitis?,greater than5 mmol/L,greater than7 mmol/L,greater than9 mmol/L,greater than10 mmol/L,greater than11 mmol/L,E,"Hypertriglyceridaemia is considered a risk factor for pancreatitis when triglyceride levels are above 11.2 mmol/L. Hypertriglyceridaemia is the third commonest cause of acute pancreatitis after alcohol and gallstones. The definition of hypertriglyceridaemia is a level greater than 1.7 mmol/L. Severe hypertriglyceridaemia is defined as 11.2-22.4 mmoL/L and very severe as above 22.4 mmol/L. The exact pathophysiology is unclear but it is thought that hydrolysis of triglycerides by pancreatic lipase and the production of free fatty acids lead to inflammatory changes. Although the clinical features are no different to cases of acute pancreatitis due to other causes, pancreatitis secondary to hypertriglyceridaemia has greater severity and is associated with a higher complication rate. "
gastrointestinal system,73,Characteristic features of intussusception include which of the following?,Attacks of facial flushing,Gradual onset over a few days,"Loose, watery stools",Palpable lump in the left iliac fossa,Vomiting,E,"Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel becomes invaginated (telescoped) into another segment of bowel just distal to it. Symptoms are sudden in onset with the infant screaming, becoming pale and drawing up his knees with discomfort. The abdominal pain is spasmodic and colicky in nature. Vomiting is another feature which often progresses to shock. Red currant jelly stools may develop due to gut wall oedema and haemorrhage. This is a late feature and is a serious sign. A palpable lump is sometimes felt in the right iliac fossa."
gastrointestinal system,74,A 22-year-old man has been admitted with severe ulcerative colitis. He has been on high-dose steroids intravenously for three days but there have been no signs of improvement. The gastroenterology team have decided to commence ciclosporin. Which of the following is a recognised adverse effect of ciclosporin?,Eczema,Hypertension,Nephrotic syndrome,Psoriasis,Rheumatoid arthritis,B,"The correct answer is hypertension. The remainder are all indications for ciclosporin use; in cases of eczema, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis patients will have severe disease. Cyclosporine also results in nephrotoxicity. Gum hypertrophy, hirsutism and convulsions are rare adverse reactions. "
gastrointestinal system,75,A 54 year old gentleman presents with new symptoms of dyspepsia. He has also noticed 5kg of weight loss over the last few months. An upper GI endoscopy is performed and reveals a lesion which is biopsied. This reveals a MALToma. What is the appropriate management for this patient?,Partial gastrectomy,Chemotherapy,Monitoring,Radiotherapy,H. pylori eradication,E,"MALTomas are generally thought to be secondary to H. Pylori infection and the majority of cases, eradication of H. Pylori leads to resolution of the MALToma, which is the most appropriate and important management initially."
gastrointestinal system,76,A 64-year-old woman is commenced on 5-fluorouracil following resection of a Dukes' C1 adenocarcinoma of the rectum. What is the mechanism of action of this agent?,Alkylating agent,DNA polymerase inhibition,Oestrogen receptor antagonism,Thymidylate synthetase inhibition,Topoisomerase II inhibition,D,"The active metabolites of 5-FU inhibit thymidylate synthetase through covalently binding to it. The drug is commonly used in the treatment of colorectal cancer usually with folinic acid. It is now often combined with oxaliplatin or irinotecan in advanced disease. Methotrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor. Cytarabine used in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML), is a DNA polymerase inhibitor. Tamoxifen is an oestrogen receptor antagonist and irinotecan is an example of a topoisomerase II inhibitor."
gastrointestinal system,77,Which of the following hormones stimulates contraction of the gallbladder?,Cholecystokinin,Gastrin,Secretin,Somatostatin,Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),A,"Gastrin leads to the release of gatric acid. Secretin stimulates the release of pancreatic fluid and bicarbonate. Somatostatin inhibits gastrointestinal endocrine secretion. Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) functions as a vasodilator and also regulates smooth muscle activity, epithelial cell secretion and gastrointestinal blood flow."
gastrointestinal system,78,"A 38-year-old female presents with colicky right upper quadrant pain and jaundice, and has noted dark urine and pale stool for three days. She has had several previous episodes of pain associated with fatty meals and on admission her bilirubin is 120 µmol/L (1-22) and alkaline phosphatase is 550 IU/L (60-110). The remainder of her LFTs are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Choledocholithiasis,Gilbert's syndrome,Pancreatic cancer,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Viral hepatitis,A,"The liver function test pattern provided shows an obstructive or post-hepatic picture thus excluding options B (pre-hepatic) and E (hepatic). The history is classic for gallstones with the recent episode representing passage of a stone into the common duct. Pancreatic cancer would be rare at 38 years of age, and it is said to present with a painless jaundice (Courvoisier's law). Sclerosing cholangitis has a male:female ratio of 2:1 and may present with weight loss, fatigue, pruritus and right upper quadrant discomfort, although the majority are asymptomatic and are diagnosed after investigation of elevated alkaline phosphatase."
gastrointestinal system,79,Which of the following drugs is an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 hepatic enzymes?,Carbamazepine,Griseofulvin,Omeprazole,Phenytoin,Rifampicin,C,The correct answer is omeprazole. The remainder of the listed options are all cytochrome P450 inducers. 
gastrointestinal system,80,A 43-year-old male presents with weight loss and watery diarrhoea. Investigations reveal hypokalaemia with a pancreatic mass. Which of the following would support the diagnosis of a VIPoma?,Achlorhydria,Hypoglycaemia,Increased pancreatic polypeptide,Migratory erythema,Pellagra,A,"Achlorhydria is classically associated with VIPoma together with profuse diarrhoea, a hypokalaemic acidosis and hyperglycaemia. Migratory erythema is associated with a glucagonoma. Although raised pancreatic polypeptide is seen with a VIPoma it is unusual and is more commonly associated with its own syndrome. Pellagra is associated with the carcinoid syndrome."
gastrointestinal system,81,A 25 year old female presents with a 6 month history of alternating diarrhoea and constipation. She also complains of abdominal bloating and passing mucous per rectum. There is no history of weight loss and her bloods are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Ulcerative Colitis,Colorectal carcinoma,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,Coeliac disease,Crohns disease,C,The history is highly indicative of IBS. Bloods are normal and there is no weight loss which excludes more sinister disease. In coeliac disease you would expect a history of steatorrhoea. In IBD there would be a history of bloody diarrhoea and weight loss. The patient is young and therefore colorectal cancer is therefore unlikely.
gastrointestinal system,82,A 28 year old pregnant female presents with pruritus. Bloods reveal deranged transaminases and elevated bilirubin. Other bloods are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute fatty liver,HELLP syndrome,Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy,Hyperemesis Gravidarum,Viral hepatitis,C,Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy usually occurs in the third trimester and presents with pruritus. It is thought that oestrogen play a role in the pathophysiology. There is an increase in bilirubin and transaminases. Patients with hyperemesis gravidarum present with severe nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  In up to half of cases there may be deranged LFTs. HELLP syndrome is a complication of preeclampsia and thrombocytopenia and haemolysis is also observed. In acute fatty liver bilirubin is not normally elevated.
gastrointestinal system,83,"A 53-year-old man who is a heavy alcohol drinker presents to the Emergency Department with a 12 hour history of sharp, central abdominal pain and vomiting. He prefers to sit up as the pain is aggravated on lying flat. On examination, he is mildly jaundiced, his temperature is 38.2°C, his pulse rate is 132/min and his blood pressure is 118/82 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals periumbilical discolouration and maximal tenderness over the epigastric region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute pancreatitis,Acute viral hepatitis,Crohn's disease,Perforated duodenal ulcer,Pyelonephritis,A,"The common causes for acute pancreatitis include:  alcohol gallstones trauma hyperlipidaemia, and certain drugs, such as azathioprine.  Pancreatitis is thought to result from early activation of pancreatic enzymes, producing auto-digestion of the pancreas and surrounding tissues. Exposure of trypsinogen to lysosomal enzymes (e.g. cathepsin B) may be the cause for early trypsin activation. Digestive enzyme release is amplified as acinar cells lyse, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation and necrosis. Central abdominal pain that starts at a low intensity and gradually becomes very painful is a very common presentation. The pain may radiate to the back and may be relieved by sitting forward. This is usually associated by nausea and vomiting. On examination, the patient may be tachycardic, pyrexial, jaundiced and may or may not manifest signs and symptoms of shock. There may be discolouration in the peri-umbilical region (Cullen's sign). Blood test may reveal elevated inflammatory markers and a significantly raised serum amylase levels. Management of acute pancreatitis includes:  keeping the patient nil by mouth and insertion of nasogastric tube intravenous fluids analgesia antibiotics, and plasma expanders (if there is haemodynamic compromise).  Laparotomy may be indicated in selected patients in whom there is evidence of fulminant pancreatic necrosis. A CT scan may be needed prior to laparotomy. Complications of acute pancreatitis include intra-abdominal infection, pseudocyst, renal failure and pancreatic necrosis."
gastrointestinal system,84,"A 36-year-old female intravenous drug abuser is seen in the Emergency department with jaundice, a fever and vague right upper quadrant pain. Prior to accepting the patient, a liver function test is requested and this shows the following:    Bilirubin 170 µmol/L (1-22)   Aspartate aminotransferase 1500 IU/L (1-31)   Alkaline phosphatase 220 IU/L (45-105)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cholecystitis,Choledocholithiasis,Hepatitis C,Pancreatic cancer,Sclerosing cholangitis,C,"Given the history this is patient must be suspected of having an infective hepatitis, either B or C. The acute presentation is in two phases: a pre-icteric (normal bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase with markedly elevated transaminases), followed by an icteric phase (markedly elevated bilirubin and transaminases and a slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase). Viral titres should be requested. Acute cholecystitis alone is not usually associated with deranged LFTs, although a mild obstructive picture can be seen in severe inflammation. The other options are all examples of extrahepatic or obstructive jaundice and they would be expected to exhibit an elevation of the alkaline phosphatase, but a transaminitis would not be expected."
gastrointestinal system,85,A 50-year-old woman with a long history of alcohol abuse is prescribed phenytoin for epilepsy. Examination was normal except for a liver edge. Her full blood count reveals:    Haemoglobin 100 g/L (115-165)   MCV 122 fL (80-96)   White cell count 2.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 85 ×10^9/L (150-400)    Which is the most likely explanation for these results?,Alcoholic liver disease,Aplastic anaemia,Folic acid deficiency,Hypothyroidism,Vitamin C deficiency,C,"Folic acid deficiency would give all these results. In addition, she has good reason to be folate deficient since she drinks a considerable amount and is taking anticonvulsants. Alcoholic liver disease on its own would not make her leucopenic. Hypothyroidism would cause a raised MCV, but not the other parameters. Scurvy does not cause this picture. Aplastic anaemia could cause this haematological picture but the clinical scenario leads towards folic acid deficiency."
gastrointestinal system,86,A patient needs central venous access for total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Which of the following is the cleanest site for placement?,Left femoral,Left internal jugular,Right femoral,Right internal jugular,Right subclavian,E,Right or left subclavian is regarded as the cleanest site for central venous access. It also the most tolerated by patients. However the incidence of subclinical pneumothorax even in the hands of experienced clinicians has led to it falling out of favour.
gastrointestinal system,87,"A 36-year-old patient came with diarrhea, bleeding, weight loss and fistula. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Colorectal ca,Celiac disease,CD (Crohn’s disease),UC (Ulcerative colitis),IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome),C,Bloody diarrheacan occur in both CD & UC. Also weight loss is common! but fistula formation is a well-recognized complication of CD
gastrointestinal system,88,A patient presents with haematemesis. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy detects a bleed in the lesser curvature of the stomach. Which of the following arteries is most likely to be the cause of the bleeding?,Left gastro-omental artery,Pancreaticoduodenal artery,Right gastric artery,Right hepatic artery,Splenic artery,C,"The pancreaticoduodenal artery supplies mainly the upper and lower duodenum and the head of the pancreas. The gastro-omental arteries supply the greater curvature of the stomach. The right gastric artery arises from the hepatic artery or the left hepatic artery supplies the pylorus and travels along the lesser curvature of the stomach, supplying it, and anastomosing with the left gastric artery."
gastrointestinal system,89,A 70 year old male who has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation and peripheral vascular disease presents with abdominal pain which is crampy in nature. On examination he looks unwell and clammy. He was hypotensive and tachycardic. His abdomen was minimally tender and there was no evidence of peritonism. His inflammatory markers are increased as is amylase. His lactate is elevated at 5. He has been having pain intermittently after eating for some time. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Mesenteric Ischaemia,Perforation,Pancreatitis,Uncontrolled Atrial Fibrillation,Sepsis,A,"The history of pain after eating is a clue. In acute or chronic mesenteric ischaemia there is often severe abdominal pain and classically little to find in the abdomen. Amylase is elevated as is lactate and the patient appears very unwell. Perforation could be considered in this case as well, however normally there would be signs of peritonism and the history of AF and PVD is more indicative of mesenteric ischaemia. AF provides an embolic source which is the likely underlying cause of the mesenteric ischaemia."
gastrointestinal system,90,With which of the following is carcinoma of the oesophagus positively associated?,Barrett's oesophagus,Blood group A,Colonic carcinoma,Crohn's disease,Oesophagitis,A,"In the United Kingdom oesophageal cancer is the eighth most common malignancy with a 3:1 male:female ratio. Approximately two thirds of oesophageal carcinomas are adenocarcinomas and one third squamous cell carcinomas. If reflux disease results in Barrett's oesophagus, then there is an increased risk of malignant change. Up to 1% of the population may have Barrett's epithelium. This is defined as endoscopically visible columnar epithelium, of any length, that shows intestinal metaplasia on histological examination. The rate of malignant change is estimated at 1% per annum which gives a lifetime risk of 25% if the condition is diagnosed in middle age. Other factors in the development of oesophageal malignancy are:  Obesity High fat intake Cigarette smoking, and High alcohol intake.  Specific risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma include:  Achalasia Coeliac disease, and Caustic stricture."
gastrointestinal system,91,"A 52 year old female presents with increasing fatigue over the last few months.  She has also noticed pains in the joints of his fingers.  She has noticed she is irritable and is having severe mood swings.  Recently her periods have stopped.  She has also noticed being thirsty and increased urinary frequency.  On examination she appears very tanned and there is evidence of hepatomegaly.  Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment should be initiated?",Venesection,NSAIDs,Metformin,Steroids,Hormone replacement therapy,A,The most likely diagnosis is haemochromatosis.  There is evidence of liver disease and pigmentation which is highly suggestive of this.  Arthralgia especially in the hands can occur de to iron deposition.  Deposition of iron can also lead to hypogonadism and amenorrhoea.  She is also showing symptoms of diabetes mellitus (polyuria and polydipsia) which is another feature secondary to pancreatic involvement.  Haemochromatosis is due to genetic mutation of the HFE gene on chromosome 6 which leads to excessive iron absorption.  It is an autosomal recessive inheritance and the known mutations are C282Y and H63D.  A transferrin saturation of >50% is indicative of iron accumulation and genetic testing for HFE mutations.  Ferritin is also raised but this can be raised in other conditions but is useful for monitoring in venesection.  Also ferritin does not always rise until later on in the disease as it will not rise until liver concentrations are increased.  Venesection should be commenced to reduced iron overload.  Ferritin is more useful for monitoring response to venesection as ferritin decreases steadily whilst transferrin saturation remains raised and only falls when iron deficiency occurs.  It is therefore recommended to monitor ferritin monthly and then measure transferrin saturation once ferritin is <50 microgram/L.  Haemoglobin should also be monitored.
gastrointestinal system,92,Which of the following is a recognised cause of gingival hyperplasia?,Allopurinol,Hyoscine,Penicillamine,Phenytoin,Prednisolone,D,A rare adverse effect of allopurinol includes a metallic taste. Hyoscine commonly causes a dry mouth. Penicilliamine can cause oral ulceration and loss of taste. Prednisolone commonly results in Candida infection. 
gastrointestinal system,93,A 46-year-old man with a family history of haemochromatosis presented to outpatients for advice. Investigations revealed:    Serum ferritin 453 µg/L (15-300)   Serum iron 29 mol/L (12-30)   Serum iron binding capacity 46 mol/L (45-75)   Transferrin saturation 63% (20-50)    Which is the most appropriate next step in management?,Arrange for DNA analysis,Begin a venesection programme,Monitor his serum ferritin regularly,Take no action unless the iron saturation exceeds 90%,Undertake a liver biopsy,A,"This man is likely to have hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC). Haemachromatosis is caused by dysregulated iron homeostatis due to inappropriate, increased iron absorption in the duodenum and proximal small intestine. It is an autosomal recessive hereditary condition which is associated with homozygous C282Y mutation of the HFE gene in North Europeans. Increased absorption of iron results in its deposition in the organs, notably the liver, pancreas, heart, joints, skin and pituitary. This causes cirrhosis, restrictive cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus, arthropathy, skin hyperpigmentation, and gonadal failure. Males and females are affected equally but females are often 'protected' from the clinical features by menstrual blood loss. Arthropathy is relatively common. It is chronic and progressive and mildly inflammatory. There is a predilection for the metacarpophalangeal joints and is often accompanied by chondrocalcinosis. Iron load is probably a major determinant but it does not usually respond to venesection. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in haemochromatosis as survival and morbidity are improved if phlebotomy is initiated prior to the development of cirrhosis. Transferrin saturation is suggested as the initial screening test: a level of more than 45% warrants further investigation (less than 45% usually excludes the diagnosis). Genetic screening is then performed. If the usual C282Y HFE mutation is found this makes the diagnosis. Ferritin is measured to help guide further investigation and treatment: if more than 1000 a liver biopsy should be performed and treatment initiated. If the ferritin is within normal range and the liver function tests are normal, patients can be followed closely. If the C282Y HFE mutation is not present, other genotypes should be looked for and if present a liver biopsy is indicated. The goal of therapy is to remove excess body iron stores; it is commonly done via phlebotomy. Initially, this is weekly or twice weekly (if tolerated) venesections of 500 cm^3 until the serum ferritin is less than 50 ng/mL. Transferritin saturation should also be reduced to less than 50% if possible. After these goals are reached maintenance therapy is typically required three to four times per year. The diagnosis of haemachromatosis should obviously be made before you initiate such treatment. When iron overload and anaemia are present concomitantly, chelation with desferoxamine may be required. Patients should be told to avoid vitamin C supplementation as this can enhance iron toxicity. End stage liver disease, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma (which is increased up to 200-fold) may necessitate liver transplantation. This is associated with poorer outcome compared with other indications because of increased incidence of infection and cardiac complications. A liver biopsy is not required to make the diagnosis of HHC although may be indicated for prognostic reasons if cirrhosis is suspected."
gastrointestinal system,94,Which of the following is correct regarding benign gastric ulcers?,"Are associated with increased acid secretion, especially at night",Are more common in women than men,Are usually multiple,Are usually situated on the greater curvature,Occur more frequently in patients receiving steroids,E,"Benign ulcers:  are more likely to occur on the lesser curve are precipitated by drugs occur in men, and are more likely to be single.  Ulcers in the greater curve are more likely to be malignant."
gastrointestinal system,95,"A 28-year-old woman presents with a six month history of diarrhoea and weight loss. On examination her abdomen is mildly distended. She is found to be anaemic, liver function tests are abnormal and iron and folate levels are both low. Tissue transglutaminase antibody level is elevated and duodenal biopsies demonstrate increased intraepithelial lymphocytes and villous atrophy consistent with a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Which cell type is responsible for the hypersensitivity response against gluten?",B cell,Macrophage,Monocytes,Natural killer (NK) cell,T cell,E,Coeliac disease results from small bowel inflammation and atrophy due to T-cell mediated hypersensitivity reaction to the alpha-gliadin component of gluten. 
gastrointestinal system,96,"A 17-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department complaining of intense pain on defecation, which persists for some hours after the event. The pain recurs with each bowel movement, and is so severe that he is now scared to defecate. He is passing harder stools over the past few months and has noticed fresh blood on the paper and occasionally even drips of blood into the toilet. From the history, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Anal fissure,Crohn's disease,Irritable bowel syndrome,Rectal carcinoma,Ulcerative colitis,A,"The history is of an anal fissure, which arises as a mucosal tear following passage of a hard stool. Most anal fissures occur in the posterior midline. The majority of cases respond to conservative therapy which includes stool softeners and bulking agents. Topical GTN treatment may also be useful for sphincter relaxation. Surgery is reserved for resistant cases."
gastrointestinal system,97,How soon after acute exposure to hepatitis B does hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) appear in the serum?,1-10 weeks,3-4 months,6-9 months,1-2 years,3-5 years,A,Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the serologic hallmark of hepatitis B virus infection. HBsAg appears in the serum one to 10 weeks following acute exposure to the hepatitis B virus prior to the onset of symptoms or a rise serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). In those who recover HBsAg will usually become undetectable after four to six months. Persistence of HBsAg for more than six months indicates chronic infection. Approximately less than1% of immunocompetent patients with acute hepatitis B progress to chronic infection. Of those patients with chronic HBV infection the rate of clearance of HBsAg is approximately 0.5% per year. 
gastrointestinal system,98,Which of the following is more likely to be seen in female patients with Crohn's disease who smoke?,Earlier age of disease onset,Less aggressive disease course,Older age of disease onset,Reduced risk of requiring immunosuppression,Reduced risk of requiring surgery,A,Data support an association between smoking and developing Crohn's disease. It has been shown to be associated with earlier age of onset of disease and more frequent need for immunosuppression among women with Crohn's disease but not men. Smoking is associated with a more aggressive disease course with patients more likely to require immunosuppression and surgery and a high risk of recurrence of disease following ileo-caecal resection. It is thought that smoking could alter smooth muscle tone affecting endothelial function through the production of nitric oxide production or that it affects the integrity of the gut mucous barrier. Oxidative stress may also be a cause as it has been found that mononuclear cells from smokers with Crohn's disease but not ulcerative colitis were less sensitive to anti-inflammatory protection against oxidative free radical stress. Smoking cessation is associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis. 
gastrointestinal system,99,"A 17-year-old man presents to the clinic with intermittent severe pain when passing a motion, accompanied by bright red rectal bleeding. The pain often lasts for hours afterwards and he is afraid of going to the toilet. He says he does not like eating fruit and vegetables and that his motion is usually very hard and he only passes faeces every two to three days. He has not lost any weight and otherwise feels well, holding down a job in a computer shop whilst doing his A levels. His BP is 122/72 mmHg, pulse is 72, general physical examination is normal. Investigations show:    Hb 131 g/L (135-180)   WCC 6.2 ×10^9/L (4-10)   PLT 203 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 138 mmol/L (134-143)   K 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Cr 102 μmol/L (60-120)    Given these findings, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Anal fissure,Anal fistula,Irritable bowel syndrome,Piles,Ulcerative colitis,A,"Paroxysms of pain, accompanied by episodes of bleeding are typical of anal fissure. The initiating factor for formation of an anal fissure is thought to be passage of a particularly hard motion which leads to trauma. In most people, acute tears in the anal mucosa heal spontaneously but in some, they lead to a chronic anal fissure. Stool softeners are the mainstay of therapy, with surgery reserved for those who fail medical intervention."
gastrointestinal system,100,"A 39-year-old man who is known to drink three bottles of wine per day presents to the Emergency Department with dull abdominal pain. He tells you that he has suffered from increasing abdominal swelling over the past month. On examination his BP is 105/72 mmHg, his pulse is 92 and regular. He is pyrexial 37.9°C. His abdomen is generally tender but there are bowel sounds on auscultation. He is penicillin allergic. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 105 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 11.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 125 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 134 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 3.6 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 µmol/L (79-118)   Neutrophils / ml in ascitic fluid 280 (less than250)    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Ciprofloxacin and vancomycin,Co-amoxiclav,Erythromycin and ciprofloxacin,Erythromycin and metronidazole,Piperacillin and tazobactam,A,"The diagnosis here is spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Note the history of alcohol excess, gradully increasing abdominal girth, and elevated neutrophil count in the ascitic fluid. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis should be managed aggressively, and whilst piperacillin and tazobactam are an appropriate choice in those who are not penicillin allergic. In this case ciprofloxacin and vancomycin are the default choice due to the presence of penicillin allergy. Oral continuation therapy is with ciprofloxacin alone or co-trimoxazole. Co-amoxiclav is not appropriate due to the presence of penicillin allergy, nor is the piperacillin and tazobactam combination. The two erythromycin combinations do not provide an adequate breadth of coverage."
gastrointestinal system,101,"An asymptomatic 40-year-old female underwent an abdominal ultrasound scan as part of a clinical trial and was noted to have gallstones, but entirely normal liver function tests. Which one of the following is the most appropriate management?",Chenodeoxycholic acid ,Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ,Lithotripsy ,Observation ,Ursodeoxycholic acid ,D,This patient is asymptomatic and does not require any treatment at present. andquot;If it ain't broke don't fix itandquot; is the general rule. There is no proven role for the use of oral drugs to try to reduce the formation of gallstones. The only definitive treatment would be a cholecystectomy but that is not generally offered for asymptomatic gallstones.
gastrointestinal system,102,Which of the following is true regarding childhood accidents?,Intentional injury is the most common cause of death between the ages of 1 and 14 years in the UK,Pedestrian motor vehicle accidents are an uncommon cause of accidental death in childhood,Reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured on the roads by 50% is a government target,There is a female: male ratio of 2:1,They are much more common in social classes 1 and 2,C,"Unintentional injuries including poisonings are the most common cause of death between the ages of 1 and 14 years. A government undertaking was to reduce by 50% the number of children killed or seriously injured by 2010 The causes reflect the child's stage of development and ability to understand danger, in addition to the degree of exposure to various hazards. Motor vehicle accidents (particularly pedestrian) are the most common, followed by fire and flame, and followed by drowning, followed by inhalations and ingestions. There is a marked social class gradient. This partly reflects different environmental circumstances (for example, playing on roads)."
gastrointestinal system,103,"A 36-year-old man presents with a 16-week history of indigestion. Five years previously, he had been treated for a duodenal ulcer. Investigations reveal:    Fasting gastrin 120 pmol/l (less than55)    Which one of the following statements regarding gastrin is correct?",It acts upon the G cells of the stomach,It inhibits the secretion of pancreatic bicarbonate,It is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreatic islets,It is produced by the parietal cells of the stomach,Its release is stimulated by gastric luminal peptides,E,Gastrin is mainly produced in two forms by the G cells of the gastric antrum. It stimulates the parietal cells to produce hydrochloric acid and its production is stimulated by neural reflex pathways and also by the direct effect of digested peptides on the G cells themselves. Gastrin may have some effect in stimulating exocrine pancreatic secretions.
gastrointestinal system,104,Which of the following is correct regarding reflux oesophagitis?,Can be reliably diagnosed by histology,Can be treated with anticholinergic drugs,Is associated with Barrett's oesophagus,Is characterised by increased oesophageal clearance of refluxed material,Occurs uncommonly in systemic sclerosis,C,"Reflux oesophagitis is associated with:  Barrett's oesophagus The use of agents such as steroids Obesity, and Raised intrabdominal pressure.  There is no reliable histological appearance, but it is generally a clinical diagnosis."
gastrointestinal system,105,Which of the following is correct with regard to mesenteric infarction?,Causes hyperactive or tinkling bowel sounds,Has no association with atrial fibrillation,Is commonly caused by occlusion of the inferior mesenteric artery,Leads to metabolic alkalosis,Results in oedematous bowel,E,"Mesenteric infarction may be caused due to occlusion of any of the three anterior abdominal aortic branches (coeliac, superior and the inferior mesenteric vessels). However, it is frequently caused due to occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery. The occlusion may be due to a thrombus, an embolus, dissecting aneurysm or vasculitis, although the last two are rare causes of this condition. It is frequently associated with atrial fibrillation and is more common in the elderly. Clinical features include persistent, severe and generalised abdominal pain. Bowel sounds are frequently absent. Blood gas may reveal a metabolic acidosis due to multiplication of anaerobic and putative organisms in the dead gut and the rapidly evolving sepsis. The infarcted bowel is at first pale, but then becomes oedematous and suffused before rapidly discolouring and turning dark blue as the stagnant blood in its extensive vascular bed becomes deoxygenated."
gastrointestinal system,106,"What therapy can be utilised, following a variceal bleed to reduce risk of further bleeding?",Albumin,Amlodipine,Terlipressin,Nil,Propanolol or carvedilol,E,"Although banding is very useful at the time of the variceal blood, the long term reduction and secondary prevention is achieved with propanolol or carvedilol."
gastrointestinal system,107,"An 80-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain and diarrhoea. She has a history of diabetes, recent myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation. Laboratory report showed:    Lactate 5.1 mmol/L (0.5-1.6)   Creatinine 98 µmol/L (60-110)    Which of the following is the best next management option? ",Abdominal x ray,CT scan,Intravenous antibiotics alone,Laparotomy,Ultrasound scan,B,"CT scan is important in this scenario for diagnosis of the underlying cause of pain. There are several differentials to consider including:  ischaemic bowel (embolic - atrial fibrillation, mural thrombus, or poor perfusion secondary to her myocardial infarction) diverticulitis gastroenteritis, and dehydration.  Ultrasound and abdominal x ray are unlikely to provide any more useful information. Laparotomy would be very high risk and blind treatment with antibiotics is not advisable without establishing a diagnosis."
gastrointestinal system,108,"A 84-year-old man is admitted on the surgical intake complaining of jaundice, weight loss, dark urine and urticaria. He drinks 30 units of alcohol per week. On examination he is found to have a palpable gallbladder. Admission bloods include the following LFTs:    Bilirubin 156 µmol/L (1-22)   ALT 68 U/L (5-35)   Alkaline phosphotase 1896 U/L (45-105)    What is the most likely diagnosis from the list below?",Cholangiocarcinoma,Cholecystitis,Cholelithiasis,Liver cirrhosis,Pancreatic carcinoma,E,"This gentleman's history suggests that he has obstructive rather than hepatocellular jaundice. The liver function profile also has an obstructive pattern. Courvoisier's law states that, in the presence of jaundice, an enlarged gallbladder is unlikely to be due to gallstones; rather carcinoma of the pancreas or lower biliary tree is more likely. Pancreatic cancer is far more common than cholangiocarcinoma."
gastrointestinal system,109,"A 56-year-old lady who is on long term non-steroidal drug treatment for arthritis is brought to the Emergency department with a 12 hour history of sudden onset epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting. On examination, she is pale, anxious and lies still. Her blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg and her pulse rate is 108/min (regular). Abdominal examination reveals severe tenderness over the epigastric region, generalised guarding and a board like rigidity. An erect chest x ray reveals gas under the diaphragm. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",Acute cholecystitis,Acute pancreatitis,Adhesive small bowel obstruction,Perforated peptic ulcer,Ruptured left dome of diaphragm,D,"Perforated peptic ulcer is a recognised complication seen in patients taking prolonged treatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. These drugs irritate the gastric mucosa leading to increased gastric secretion. Other risk factors for peptic ulceration (and perforation) include:  Helicobacter pylori infection Smoking Excessive alcohol consumption, and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  Severe epigastric pain, nausea and vomiting are the frequent presenting complaints. The pain may radiate to the back or shoulder tip. Patients with a perforated viscus may present with signs of hypovolaemic shock. In the early stage of peritoneal irritation, the patient is pale, anxious and loath to move. The whole abdomen is tender with board-like rigidly. The abdomen may be dull to percuss, since sufficient gas may have escaped from the perforated viscus to reduce liver dullness in the mid-axillary line. The diagnosis for a perforated peptic ulcer may be made on an erect chest x ray, where free gas under the diaphragm may be found. There may be elevated serum amylase levels, although the levels may not be as high as seen in acute pancreatitis. The complications of perforated peptic ulcer include peritonitis and upper GI bleeding. Immediate management involves:  Oxygen Intravenous access Bloods taken for appropriate investigations (full blood count, electrolytes, coagulation profile, and group and save) Intravenous fluids and antibiotics (if there is evidence of generalised peritonitis) Analgesia Keeping the patient nil-by-mouth, and Insertion of a naso-gastric tube.  Laparotomy and closure of the perforation (over-sewing the perforation with a small patch of omentum) is the surgical treatment of choice."
gastrointestinal system,110,"A 40-year-old woman with a history of Crohn's disease and multiple previous operations presents to the gastroenterology clinic. She has begun suffering from increasing symptoms of early satiety, loss of appetite, bloating and diarrhoea over the past few months. She has lost weight, and is worried as she finds it very difficult to maintain her weight anyway. On examination her BMI is 18.5 kg/m^2. Physical examination is unremarkable apart from mild abdominal distension, and a number of old scars related to previous surgery. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (115-165)   MCV 104 fL (80-96)   White cell count 6.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   ESR 11 mm/hr (less than10)   Platelets 175 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 136 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 μmol/L (79-118)   Serum albumin 32 g/L (35-50)   Hydrogen breath test Positive    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial overgrowth syndrome,Exacerbation of Crohn's disease,Functional diarrhoea,Pernicious anaemia,Short bowel syndrome,A,"Symptoms of bloating, abdominal distension and diarrhoea are very consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth syndrome. The hydrogen breath test further supports the diagnosis. The fact that the ESR is normal significantly reduces the likelihood that this is an exacerbation of Crohn's. The raised MCV is related to B12 deficiency, which is also caused by bacterial overgrowth. Both metronidazole and tetracyclines are used in the management of the condition."
gastrointestinal system,111,Which of the following is true regarding intussusception?,"Has an incidence of 1 in 10,000 infants",Is commonly ileo-ileal,Is not associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura,Is rarely reduced by air enema,May occur in the absence of rectal bleeding,E,"Intussusception occurs in 1 in 400-500 infants. Lymphoid hyperplasia is the commonest cause of the invagination, although polyps, Meckel's diverticulum and haematomas secondary to Henoch-Schönlein purpura may act as lead points. The majority are ileo-colic. Rectal bleeding, if present, is a late sign and air enema reduction is the treatment of choice."
gastrointestinal system,112,Which of the following is true in pyloric stenosis?,Hartmann's solution is the resuscitation fluid of choice,Inadequate correction of the biochemical abnormality may result in post operative apnoea and hypoventilation,Initially the kidneys excrete an acidic urine,Pyloromyotomy should not be delayed in the presence of persistent vomiting,The biochemical abnormality found in these patients is characterised by a hyperchloraemic alkalosis,B,"Congenital pyloric stenosis usually presents in male infants in the first two months of life. The electrolyte abnormality is characteristically hypochloraemic alkalosis (not hyperchloraemic), due to the loss of chloride and hydrogen ions during persistent vomiting. The initial response by the kidneys is to excrete alkaline urine (not acidic), which also contains sodium and potassium ions. Conservation of water, sodium and chloride ions causes the kidneys to excrete potassium and hydrogen ions in exchange for sodium ions. The acidic urine exacerbates the alkalaemia resulting in hypokalaemia. Performing a pyloromyotomy is not a surgical emergency, and it should be delayed until the infant has been fluid resuscitated and the biochemical profile normalised. Acceptable plasma electrolyte values are:  Chloride ions greater than90 mmol/L Sodium ions greater than135 mmol/L Bicarbonate ions less than25 mmol/L.  Post operative apnoea and hypoventilation may occur if surgery is performed before correction of the biochemical abnormality, and is due to an alkaline cerebrospinal fluid. Normal saline is the fluid of choice, as it is a hydrogen ion donor and does not contribute to the bicarbonate load. Hartmann's solution should be avoided in patients with metabolic alkalosis."
gastrointestinal system,113,A 45-year-old gentleman presents with dyspepsia of five months duration and loss of weight. Examination reveals mild pallor and slight epigastric tenderness. Gastroscopy reveals 5 mm posterior ulcer in the first part of the duodenum and 2 cm mass on the lesser curve of the stomach. Biopsy of the mass reveals mucosa-associated lymphoid tumour confined to gastric mucosa. He has tested positive for H. pylori infection. Which of the following treatment options will be appropriate for him?,Chemotherapy,H. pylori eradication,Proton pump inhibitor,Radiotherapy,Surgery,B,Lymphomas restricted to the gastric mucosa usually disappear when H. pylori is eradicated. These lesions are less likely to respond to H. pylori eradication alone if they extend beyond the gastric mucosa. Chemotherapy or surgical excision may then be indicated. Duodenal ulcer will also disappear with H. pylori eradication.
gastrointestinal system,114,"A 45 year old female, known to have systemic sclerosis presents at clinic with worsening reflux, abdominal bloating and is also having bouts of diarrhoea and constipation. She is currently on omeprazole. On examination her abdomen is soft but is tender generally. A motility study is performed and shows severe oesophageal dysmotility and a hydrogen breath test is positive. How would you manage this patient?",Amoxicillin,Metronidazole,Metoclopramide,Double dose of omeprazole,Ranitidine,B,"The most likely underlying diagnosis is bacterial overgrowth syndrome due to the history and the clinical findings and positive hydrogen breath test. Bacterial overgrowth is managed by trying to eradicate bacteria with the use of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin or co amoxiclav. These patients do however have long term problems with motility."
gastrointestinal system,115,A 28-year-old female presents with a 3 months history of diarrhea. She complains of abdominal discomfort and passing stool 20 times/day. Examination: febrile. Barium enema shows cobblestone mucosa. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Ameoba,Colon Ca,GE (gastroenteritis),CD (Crohn’s disease),UC (ulcerative colitis),D,"History of diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and patient being febrile indicate gut inflammation and cobblestone appearance on barium enema is diagnostic of CD"
gastrointestinal system,116,A 60 year old gentleman presents to his GP with tiredness and increased shortness of breath.  Bloods reveal a microcytic hypochromic anaemia and he is subsequently found to have iron deficiency anaemia.  There is no evidence of any GI symptoms.  What investigation s most appropriate to organise in this case?,Flexible sigmoidoscopy,Recheck bloods in three months time after iron supplementation,CT Chest Abdomen and Pelvis,Colonoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,D,A colonoscopy should be performed in this case as lower GI pathology is more likely to be malignant than upper GI pathology which is often oesophagitis or other benign conditions are found.  Upper GI malignancy also has a lower incidence than lower GI malignancy.  Obviously if there is any upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia or dysphagia then an upper GI endoscopy should be performed in the first instance.
gastrointestinal system,117,A 23-year-old man presents with steatorrhoea and weight loss. On examination he is found to have a vesicular rash over his elbows and knees which he describes as extremely pruritic. Which of the following immunoglobulins is characteristically present at the dermo-epidermal junction?,IgA,IgD,IgE,IgG,IgM,A,"Dermatitis herpetiformis is characterised by IgA at the dermo-epidermal junction. Dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with coeliac disease which is the underlying diagnosis in this patient. The rash which is pruritic and vesicular is found over the elbows, knees, buttocks, sacrum, trunk, face and neck. Treatment is with dapsone and a gluten-free diet. "
gastrointestinal system,118,A study comparing contrast CT colonography with the reference technique of colonoscopy for large bowel carcinoma reveals the following data in 400 patients:    Investigation CT Positive CT Negative   Colonoscopy positive 30 10   Colonoscopy negative 20 340    Which one of the following most accurately describes the performance of CT versus colonoscopy for the diagnosis of large bowel cancer?,There are 10 false positives,There are 20 false positives,There are 20 true negatives,There are 340 false negatives,There are 370 false negatives,B,"In this question colonoscopy is the reference standard whilst CT colonography is the new test being evaluated. There are 40 patients with bowel cancer as identified by colonoscopy. CT scanning correctly identifies 30 of these (true positives) but fails to identify 10 (false negatives). There are 360 patients without the disease with 20 identified as having cancer by CT (false positives), the remaining 340 are true negatives. This is perhaps best illustrated by annotating the table from above:      New Test   CT Positive CT Negative   "
gastrointestinal system,119,"A dishevelled looking middle-aged male attends the emergency department complaining of severe epigastric pain radiating to his back and vomiting. He is a frequent attendee (this being his 16th visit within 12 months) and he is smelling strongly of alcohol. His FBC, Uandamp;Es, LFT and amylase are normal, and have been on every previous occasion. On examination he has abdominal tenderness but no masses are palpable and there is no obvious abnormal enlargement of an organ What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cholecystitis,Chronic pancreatitis,Cirrhosis,Gastro-oesophgeal reflux disease,Pancreatic carcinoma,B,"Repeated attendances with severe pain are common in chronic pancreatitis secondary to alcohol abuse. Pain from chronic pancreatitis classically radiates to the back and lasts 24-48 hours, requiring opiates to gain control. Amylase levels are frequently normal or only slightly elevated as the pancreas is often 'burned out' from repeated abuse."
gastrointestinal system,120,A 45 year old gentleman presents with halitosis. He has also noticed it is sometimes difficult to swallow and sometimes regurgitates undigested food. He has also recently been diagnosed with asthma. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Oesophageal carcinoma,Achalasia,Barretts Oesophagus,Pharyngeal pouch,Hiatus Hernia,D,"The history of halitosis and regurgitation of undigested food and intermittent dysphagia is suggestive of a pharyngeal pouch. It could also represent severe reflux disease. Oesophageal cancer leads to progressive swallowing difficulties , solids then liquids and it is not intermittent. Hiatus hernia gives symptoms of indigestion and heartburn similar to Barretts Oesophagus. The diagnosis of asthma is significant as reflux can lead to aspiration of stomach acid and respiratory symptoms."
gastrointestinal system,121,Which of the following drugs is a recognised cause of pancreatitis?,Alendronic acid,Amiodarone,Amitriptyline,Atenolol,Azathioprine,E,The correct answer is azathioprine. The remaining listed options are not known to cause pancreatitis. 
gastrointestinal system,122,"A 65-year-old woman presents with a one month history of jaundice. She reports her urine is darker than normal and her stools are a pale colour. On direct questioning she admits to pruritus but denies abdominal pain. There is no history of foreign travel. She has lost approximately 1 stone in weight. On examination she is jaundiced, there are no stigmata of chronic liver disease and no asterixis. Abdominal examination reveals hepatomegaly 4 cm below the costal margin. Given the most likely diagnosis, which tumour marker is most likely to be elevated?",AFP,Beta-hCG,CA 19-9,CA 125,CEA,C,"The presentation is of painless obstructive jaundice; this is most commonly associated, particularly in the presence of systemic symptoms, with development of a hepatobiliary malignancy. The most likely diagnosis in this case is pancreatic carcinoma. The most useful tumour marker for pancreatic cancer is CA 19-9, of which the sensitivity and specificity for pancreatic carcinoma are 80% and 90% respectively. These figures are closely related to tumour size and the accuracy of using CA 19-9 to identify patients with small surgically resectable tumours is limited. CA 19-9 does not distinguish between cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic or gastric carcinoma and may also be raised in patients with severe liver injury due to any other cause. Concentrations of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) and/or the beta subunit of human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) are raised in 80-85% of men who have non-seminomatous germ cell tumours. These markers (as well as lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) are useful in prognosis, risk stratification and assessing response to treatment in testicular cancer. The serum concentration of AFP is usually raised in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However the levels do not correlate well with other clinical features such as the size of the tumour, stage or prognosis of the disease. Levels greater than 500 µg/L (normal range 10-20 µg/L) in a high-risk patient is diagnostic of HCC. AFP may also be elevated in patients with chronic liver disease without HCC for example, acute, or chronic viral hepatitis. Measurement of the CA 125 is the most widely studied biochemical method of screening for ovarian cancer. The level is raised in approximately 50% of women with early stage disease and in more than 80% of women who have advanced ovarian carcinoma. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 are associated with colorectal cancer (CRC), but they have low diagnostic ability to detect primary CRC in view of overlap with benign disease and low sensitivity for early stage disease. Other causes of raised CEA include gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, diverticulitis, liver disease, COPD, and diabetes mellitus as well as any acute or chronic inflammatory condition. Hepatocellular carcinoma would be unlikely in this case as hepatocellular carcinomas do not usually cause obstructive jaundice. Additionally, HCC is rare outside the setting of cirrhosis (typically presenting with decompensation or on routine screening) or chronic HBV. "
gastrointestinal system,123,"Regarding ulcerative colitis associated carcinoma of the colon, which of the following statements is correct?",Occurs in pseudo-polyps which are pre-malignant,Occurs when the colitis affects only a small proportion of the colon,Occurs when the colitis has been present for less than 10 years,Results in changed symptomatology,Results in multiple colonic tumours,E,"Pseudopolyps are the areas of mucosa among severe ulceration. Carcinoma in ulcerative colitis typically affects those who have had total colitis for more than 10 years, and is multi-focal in nature. The onset of malignancy is usually unheralded."
gastrointestinal system,124,A 28-year-old woman is referred by her GP to the gastroenterology clinic after a recent gastroscopy with duodenal biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of coeliac disease. What is the prevalence of coeliac disease in Europe?,1:10,1:30,0.25,0.736111111,2.125,C,"The prevalence of coeliac disease in Europe varies widely and is in the region of between 1:100 and 1:300. It is more common in the Celtic population. Coeliac disease is caused by a T cell mediated hypersensitivity reaction to gluten which causes intestinal inflammation and atrophy. It presents at any age but in adults the commonest age of presentation is 20s and 30s. Women are slightly more commonly affected. Patients usually have diarrhoea and steatorrhoea may be present. There is often a mild macrocytic anaemia with low folate. Classically iron or folate deficiency is seen. Ten per cent to 15% of patients have abnormal liver function tests. Patients may also have thrombocytosis. Low corrected calcium, vitamin D, and zinc are also seen. IgA anti-endomysial and anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies are useful serological tests. Anti-endomysial antibodies are 90% sensitive and almost 100% specific. Biopsies from the second part of the duodenum are essential and demonstrate villous atrophy. Management includes a gluten-free diet - patients should avoid wheat, barley and rye. "
gastrointestinal system,125,Which of the following is true in blunt abdominal injury?,Generalised thickening of the small bowel is usually secondary to extensive intramural haematoma,In pancreatic duct injuries the serum amylase is typically elevated,Liver lacerations are rarely associated with rib fractures,The kidney is the organ most commonly injured,The small bowel is most likely to be transected in the distal ileum,B,"In pancreatic duct injuries the serum amylase is typically elevated. There is also a leukocytosis in 90% of pancreatic injuries associated with injury to other abdominal organs. There is an average of 3.5 associated intra-abdominal injuries. Generalised thickening of the small bowel is a sign of mesenteric artery vasoconstriction secondary to hypovolaemia (ischaemia). Fifty per cent of liver lacerations have associated right lower rib fractures. In blunt abdominal injury, liver injuries are the most common. However, as 85% of those with liver injuries are stable, splenic injuries are regarded as more serious. Seat belt injuries may be caused by rapid deceleration causing transection of the jejunum within 20 cm of the ligament of Treitz. This is because of the shearing force operating between the relatively fixed proximal and the more mobile distal jejunum."
gastrointestinal system,126,Which of the following is a recognised aetiological factor in oesophageal carcinoma?,Blood group A,Gallstone disease,Helicobacter pylori infection,Obesity,Statins,D,"Obesity (which may be related to established dietary associations and lack of reducing factors such as fruit and vegetables) is a significant risk factor. Oesophageal cancer is three times more common in men. Achalasia is a recognised factor, though rare. Another factor is hot herbal tea infusates or regular consumption of very hot drinks of any kind. Barrett's oesophagus is gastric metaplasia of the lower oesophagus. The risk is significantly increased. GORD alone has a smaller increased risk. Acids or alkalis through inflammation and scarring may be associated with a later development of cancer. Aspirin, NSAIDs and statins appear to reduce the risk, as does H. pylori infection. As you work long into the night you may be reassured to know that a high coffee intake may also reduce the risk. "
gastrointestinal system,127,Which one of the following statements regarding jejunal biopsy is correct?,Electron microscopy is necessary to confirm the presence of villousatrophy,It is contraindicated over the age of 70 years,In tropical countries apparently healthy people have a mucosalstructure which would be regarded as abnormal in Europe,It can be used to diagnose Whipple's disease,Sub-total villous atrophy is diagnostic of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and is not found in other conditions,D,"The villus atrophy may be seen with a magnifying glass. There is a group of patients who present with coeliac disease in older age - sometimes in their 90s. They present with iron deficiency anaemia, osteoporosis or weight loss. A residents of a tropical country with a mucosalstructure which would be regarded as abnormal in Europe would not be described as 'healthy'. Sub-total villus atrophy is seen in a number of conditions other than coeliac disease, for instance:  Severe tropical sprue Cow's milk/soya sensitivity in children Gastroenteritis Whipple's disease Hypogammaglobulinaemia Neomycin therapy Laxative abuse, and Norwalk agent."
gastrointestinal system,128,"A 14-year-old boy has had recurrent abdominal pains, malaise and weight loss over 6 months. He has had a vague mass in the right iliac fossa. Colonoscopy and biopsy of the caecal area shows transmural inflammation and granulomata. What is the single most appropriate management?",Sulphasalazine,Appendicectomy,Aspirin,Enema and laxatives,Gluten free diet,A,"Recurrent abdominal pains, weight loss and transmural inflammation and granulomata points towards the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease which is treated with sulphasalazine"
gastrointestinal system,129,A plain abdominal x ray is useful in the diagnosis of which of the following?,Acute pancreatitis,Carcinoma of the caecum,Cholesterol gallstones,Relapsing mild ulcerative colitis,Sigmoid volvulus,E,"Up to 30% of patients with end-stage chronic pancreatitis will have diffuse calcification within the pancreas gland, best visualised by an oblique abdominal view. Caecal carcinoma is only reliably demonstrated on double-contrast barium enema, colonoscopy or CT-colonography. The 'parrot's beak' sign is the characteristic appearance of sigmoid volvulus on plain films with the distended sigmoid loop arising out of the pelvis. Cholesterol stones are typically radiolucent. Only 10% of all gallstones are radio-opaque (c.f. 90% of renal stones). Black pigment stones are more commonly calcified and therefore visible on the AXR. The plain AXR is perhaps the most useful investigation in fulminant colitis. Serial AXRs will demonstrate toxic dilatation of the colon (greater than6 cm diameter, usually the transverse colon), which is an indication for surgery."
gastrointestinal system,130,"A 24-year-old male is found to have an inflamed non-perforated appendicitis at operation. What is the most predictive symptom, sign or serological marker in appendicitis?",Low grade pyrexia,Nausea,Raised C reactive protein,Raised white cell count,Tenderness over the site of the appendix,E,"The diagnosis of appendicitis can be difficult even for the most experienced clinician. Patients with appendicitis usually present with a typical pattern of symptoms and signs. Pain is usually one of the earliest symptoms. The pain is usually periumbilical initially (irritation of the visceral peritoneum due to early obstruction, dilatation and infection of the appendix) localising to the right iliac fossa (irritation of the parietal peritoneum due to spread of infection through the appendix) a few hours later. After the initial pain, anorexia, nausea and occasionally vomiting may develop. Tenderness over the appendix is the hallmark of appendicitis. Tenderness is due to inflammation of the serosa of the appendix and overlying peritoneum. Pyrexia tends to be a late sign and may be very elevated if the appendix is perforated. Laboratory markers of infection are unreliable in appendicitis, as white cell count and C reactive protein only become raised when appendicitis is established."

gastrointestinal system,132,A 29-year-old male presents with symptoms of severe gastro-oesophageal reflux despite prolongedcourse of PPI therapy. Which one of the following is most useful in assessing the role of surgery?,Cardiac sphincter manometry,Gastric emptying study,Intragastric pH monitoring off therapy,Oesophageal motility and pH study,Water soluble contrast swallow study,D,"Laparoscopic fundoplication is the treatment of choice for patients with GORD refractory to, or intolerant of, proton pump inhibitor therapy. The patient should have had an endoscopy within the six months prior to surgery to exclude any unsuspected pathology such as Barrett's oesophagus or adenocarcinoma. An oesophageal transit study is indicated to rule out a primary motor disorder (for example, achalasia, scleroderma) when suspected, and to rule out aperistalsis, which may result in postoperative dysphagia after some forms of fundoplication.   NICE guideance states the following andquot;Oesophageal manometry and ambulatory 24-hour oesophageal pH monitoring (to quantify reflux and assess the relationship between reflux episodes and the person's symptoms). The latter investigation may help to exclude oesophageal motility disorders such as achalasia, and severe oesophageal hypomotility such as scleroderma-like oesophagus, before considering anti-reflux surgery.andquot;   "
gastrointestinal system,133,A 21-year-old man was admitted with confusion. He was noted to have Kayser-Fleischer rings and his liver function tests were consistent with acute hepatitis. Which chromosome contains the gene for this disease?,Chromosome 6,Chromosome 13,Chromosome 15,Chromosome 17,Chromosome 22,B,"The gene involved in Wilson's disease is located on chromosome 13. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder which results in copper deposition in the liver and brain, and impaired incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin. Wilson's disease is a cause of acute liver failure and can also lead to decompensated cirrhosis. Patients with neurological disease often have Kayser-Fleischer rings. In the majority of patients plasma caeruloplasmin is low (less than 200 mg/L); serum copper is less than 11 μmol/L and in 65% of patients 24-hour urinary copper is elevated at greater than 3 μmol. Liver biopsy will aid the diagnosis. Treatment includes penicillamine, which leads to urinary copper excretion. Ninety per cent of cases of haemochromatosis are caused by the substitution of tyrosine for cysteine at position 282 of the HFE gene found on chromosome 6. Marfan's syndrome is caused by defects in fibrillin; the gene responsible is located on chromosome 15. Neurofibromatosis type 1 is due to a mutation or deletion of the NF111 gene located on chromosome 17. Neurofibromatosis type 2 is the result of a mutation or deletion of the NF2 gene11 found on chromosome 22. "
gastrointestinal system,134,Which of the following is the most common cause of traveller's diarrhoea?,Entamoeba histolytica,Escherichia coli,Giardia lamblia,Shigella flexneri,Yersinia enterocolitica,B,"Enterotoxigenic E coli is the commonest cause of traveller's diarrhoea and is usually a self-limiting condition. Usually, no treatment or investigation is required for this brief diarrhoeal illness. Other causes that may be associated with prolonged diarrhoea include Giardia and amoebiasis. Chronic diarrhoea merits investigation."
gastrointestinal system,135,Approximately what proportion of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) will have a normal physical examination at the time of diagnosis?,10%,25%,50%,90%,100%,C,"Approximately half of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) will have normal examination findings at the time of diagnosis. PSC is a progressive liver disease the aetiology of which is unclear. It is characterised by inflammation and destruction of the intra- and/or extra-hepatic bile ducts which leads to liver fibrosis. It can ultimately lead to cirrhosis, increased risk of malignancy, and liver failure. PSC is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and up to 75% of patients with PSC have ulcerative colitis. Examination findings can include jaundice, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and excoriations. However half of patients will have a normal physical examination. There is no effective treatment for PSC. Ursodeoxycholic acid has not been shown to have a successful impact on the progression of disease and the majority of patients will eventually require liver transplantation. "
gastrointestinal system,136,"A 55-year-old post-menopausal woman presents with tiredness and lethargy, she denies any other symptoms. Her blood tests show that she is anaemic. Tests reveal:    Haemoglobin 103 g/L (115-165)   Mean corpuscular volume 76 fL (80-96)   Ferritin 5 µg/L (15-300)    Anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA and IgG antibodies are negative. Gastroscopy and CT colonography are both performed and do not reveal any cause for iron deficiency. She is commenced on oral ferrous sulphate and three months later her haemoglobin is 115 g/L. She comes to see you three months after this asking whether it is possible to stop the oral iron as she feels it is making her nauseated. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of iron deficiency anaemia what is the most appropriate course of action?",Change to parenteral iron,Offer transfusion as required,Refer for further investigation,Stop oral iron and monitor haemoglobin,Trial of alternative oral iron preparation,D,"Parenteral iron replacement should be considered where iron replacement is necessary but an oral preparation cannot be tolerated or absorbed. There is no indication for transfusion and there has been a response to iron supplementation that is likely to be replicated, if necessary, in the future. Initial investigations for a gastrointestinal cause for the iron deficiency have been completed and are negative, in the absence of other symptoms to suggest an alternative source for blood loss and in the presence of a good response to oral iron further investigation is not warranted. Further monitoring is required to ensure that any response is sustained. Supplementary iron is no longer required at this stage in the patient's management so switching to an alternative is not required. Alternative preparations and dose reduction may help where oral iron is not well tolerated. "
gastrointestinal system,137,A 75-year-old woman is admitted with headache and vomiting. She denies abdominal pain. She reports weight loss of one stone over the last six weeks. On further questioning it becomes apparent that she has noticed the vomitus contains food from several days ago. Abdominal x ray reveals a prominent gastric bubble. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute cholecystitis,Colon carcinoma,Gastric outflow obstruction,Peptic ulceration,Raised intracranial pressure,C,"Vomiting of food from several meals ago suggests gastric stasis or gastric outflow obstruction. In this case, with the history of weight loss, an underlying malignancy such as antral gastric carcinoma is likely. Patients with acute cholecystitis typically have abdominal pain, usually in the right upper quadrant or epigastrium. Nausea and vomiting may also occur. Patients are often febrile. Abdominal pain and change in bowel habit are the common clinical presentations of colorectal cancer. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort is the most prominent symptom in patients with peptic ulcer disease; occasionally there may be vomiting. Clinical features of raised intracranial pressure include headache, reduced consciousness and vomiting. Signs include sixth cranial nerve palsy and papilloedema. Hypertension and bradycardia (Cushing's reflex) may also be seen. "
gastrointestinal system,138,"A 19 year old female presents with a few month history of abdominal pain, watery diarrhoea and weight loss.  She has noticed on a few occasions redness of her eye causing some discomfort and bruise like lesions on her shins. A colonoscopy is performed and reveals a cobblestone appearance.  What is the most likely diagnosis? ",Colorectal Cancer,Ulcerative Colitis,Gastroenteritis,Crohns disease,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,D,This history is indicative of Crohns disease.  Bloody diarrhoea is more common in ulcerative colitis as is tenesmus.  Weight loss is often more common in Crohns disease.  The ulcers are deep and serpiginous and there is areas of normal tissue in between (skip lesions) which leads to a cobblestone appearance.  Gastroenteritis is unlikely given the chronicity and IBS does not normally results in weight loss and erythema nodosum and eyes signs are not a feature.  CRC would be unusual in a patient of this age.
gastrointestinal system,139,A patient presents with dysphagia and pain on swallowing. He has sore mouth and soreness in the corners of the mouth. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Kaposi’s sarcoma,Molluscum contagiosum,CMV infection,Candida infection,Toxoplasma abscess,D,Candida and CMV infection both can be the answer but Candida is more common than CMV
gastrointestinal system,140,"A 50-year-old man is admitted to hospital with a third attack of renal stones in the last six months. He suffers from Crohn's disease and has previously had a limited small bowel resection, but his disease is now quiescent. On examination his BP is 115/72 mmHg, his BMI is 19.5 kg/m^2, and he has a midline scar consistent with a previous laparotomy. Investigations:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 5.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 172 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 133 μmol/L (79-118)   24 hour urinary oxalate excretion Increased -    Which of the following is likely to be the most effective and appropriate intervention?",Increase fluid intake,Reduce dietary calcium intake,Reduce intake of offal,Start bendroflumethiazide,Start furosemide,A,"Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain the develop of hyperoxaluria in patients with intestinal disease. These include increased colonic permeability, reduced free intestinal calcium available to bind oxalate, and decreased levels of O formigenes to degrade intestinal oxalate.  Reducing intake of offal is most helpful at reducing urate excretion; foods such as chocolate, rhubarb, and nuts are high in oxalate. One contributor to this patient's increased oxalate excretion is undoubtedly his partial small bowel resection, and increasing dietary calcium intake decreases urinary oxalate excretion by reducing absorption (as free oxalate is bound).  Therefore, the most effective and appropriate intervention from those given is to increase his oral fluid intake significantly. Increased fluid intake restores fluid lost through the digestive tract, and also acts as a dilutional inhibitor of crystal and stone formation. Other treatments which can help enteric hyperoxaluria include:  Calcium, cholestyramine and magnesium - bind strongly to free intestinal oxalate, preventing absorption. Iron and aluminium - act as intestinal oxalate-binding agents. Potassium citrate - alkalinises the urine, which reduces urinary oxalate excretion."
gastrointestinal system,141,Which is true of achalasia of the oesophagus?,Is caused due to absence of ganglion cells in the Meissner's plexus of the oesophagus,Is more common in the elderly,Leads to progressive dysphagia to solids then liquids,Results in a characteristic gastric air bubble on a chest x ray,Usually demonstrates a double right heart border on a chest x ray,E,"Achalasia cardia is a neuromuscular failure of relaxation at the lower end of the oesophagus due to loss of ganglion cells from the myenteric (Auerbach's) plexus. The myenteric plexus contains paraasympathertic and sympathetic fibres. It is the main motor supply (motility) to the gastrointestinal tract. Absence of ganglion cells in the neural plexus of the intestinal wall leads to Hirschsprung's disease. Meissner's plexus contains only sympathetic fibres and is secretomotor to the mucosa. It is more common in females (3:2) and is frequently seen during the third decade of life. There is progressive dysphagia to both solids and liquids, chest pain and regurgitation of old food from the dilated oesophageal sac. A dilated oesophagus with a tapering lower oesophageal segment, likened to a bird's beak, which fails to relax is revealed on x ray There is absence of gastric air bubbles because the dilated oesophagus never completely empties and therefore swallowed air cannot pass into the stomach. Chest x ray shows air or fluid level behind the heart and the expanded oesophagus gives the appearance of a 'double right heart border'."
gastrointestinal system,142,A 22-year-old man returned from a back-packing holiday three weeks ago. While abroad he developed bloody diarrhoea with abdominal pain. Stool cultures have confirmed Salmonella enteritidis. Which of the following antibiotics would be first line treatment?,Ampicillin,Ciprofloxacin,Erythromycin,Metronidazole,Tetracycline,B,Ciprofloxacin is the antibiotic of choice for the treatment of Salmonella - 500 mg bd for 10-14 days. Diarrhoea occurs due to increased water in the stool. The definition of chronic diarrhoea is the abnormal passage of three or more loose or liquid stools per day for more than four weeks and/or a daily stool volume greater than 200 ml/day (weight greater than 200 g/day). Ampicillin or ciprofloxacin can be used for the treatment of Shigella. Erythromycin is used in Campylobacter jejuni. Metronidazole is used for Clostridium difficile. Tetracycline is given for Yersinia enterocolitica. 
gastrointestinal system,143,A 19-year-old student presents with weight loss and blood loss per rectum. You organise a flexible sigmoidoscopy. Which of the following histological features would favour a diagnosis of Crohn's disease and not ulcerative colitis?,Crypt abscesses,Goblet cell mucus depletion,Lymphocyte infiltrate of the lamina propria,Metaplastic polyp formation,Non-caseating granulomas,E,"Ulcerative colitis is characterised by mucosal inflammation with  General inflammatory cell infiltration Goblet-cell mucus depletion Crypt abscesses Crypt shortening Branching.  There is continuous inflammation, worsening from rectum to caecum. In contrast, Crohn's disease is characterised by transmural inflammation, with  Lymphocytic infiltrates and lymphoid aggregates Fissures Preservation of crypt architecture Non-caseating granulomata.  There is patchy inflammation from mouth to anus."
gastrointestinal system,144,A 38 year old male with known alcohol excess presents after vomiting up large amounts of fresh blood.  On examination he is hypotensive and tachycardic and there is evidence of ascites and peripheral stigmata of liver disease. He is fluid resucitated and given IV terlipressin and antibiotics. What is the next step in your management?,IV somatostatin,IV omeprazole,Upper GI endoscopy and banding,Sengstaken tube,Colonoscopy,C,Initially following fluid resucitation IV terlipressin should be given as it is a splanchnic vasoconstrictor and this aids in reduceing bleeding from vrices.  IV antibiotics should also be given as there can be translocation of bacteria during varcieal bleeding and this is to reduce risk of sepsis.  These steps should be performed initally but ultimately the patient requires and upper GI endoscopy and banding.  A sengstaken tube is only used as a last resort thus fails and the patient continues to bleed despite banding.
gastrointestinal system,145,A 42-year-old female who is obese comes with severe upper abdominal pain with a temperature 37.8C. She has 5 children. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Ectopic pregnancy,Ovarian torsion,Hepatitis,Biliary colic,Cholecystitis,E,"Fat, female, fare, forty and fertile are the pnemonic for cholecystitis! Here the presentation of severe upper abdominal pain with fever along with the pnemonic features points towards the diagnosis of cholecystitis"
gastrointestinal system,146,A 36-year-old man presented with a three-day history of bloody diarrhoea. He was apyrexial and mildly icteric. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 105 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 19 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 70 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum urea 12.5 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum aspartate aminotransferase 90 U/L (1-31)   Prothrombin time 12 s (11.5-15.5)   Blood film Fragmented red cells    Which of the following is the most likely cause of his illness?,Escherichia coli 0157 colitis,Ischaemic colitis,Leptospirosis,Salmonella enterocolitis,Ulcerative colitis,A,"The presence of thrombocytopenia and evidence of haemolysis in association with bloody diarrhoea should make you think of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). HUS is the triad of:  microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney injury.  It is classically associated with Escherichia coli O157:H7, which produces a Shiga verotoxin. Approximately 15% of cases with Escherichia coli O157 will develop HUS. It can occur up to two weeks following the initial onset of symptoms and can present after recovery from the acute illness. The incubation period of Escherichia coli O157 is one to six days. HIV, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae and Coxsackie virus can also result in HUS, but much less commonly. The verotoxin circulates and binds to endothelial receptors, particularly in the kidney, gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system, resulting in the deposition of thrombin and fibrin in the microvasculature. Haemolysis subsequently occurs as erythrocytes travel through the affected vessels. Platelets are sequestered resulting in lower circulating numbers. Treatment for HUS is primarily supportive with fluid and electrolyte management, antihypertensive therapy and dialysis where required. Plasma exchange can also be used to try to remove the circulating toxin. "
gastrointestinal system,147,"A 52-year-old male presents with general deterioration. He drinks approximately 29 units of alcohol each week and is a smoker of 5 cigarettes daily. Examination reveals that he is jaundiced, has numerous spider naevi on his chest, and he has a temperature of 37.8°C. Abdominal examination reveals tender hepatosplenomegaly. Investigations reveal:    Bilirubin 200 µmol/L (1-22)   Alkaline phosphatase 550 IU/L (45-105)   AST 258 IU/L (1-31)   Albumin 25 g/L (37-49)    Hepatitis B virus surface antigen positive. Hepatitis B virus e antigen negative. Hepatitis B virus DNA undetectable. Which of the following is the most likely cause for his acute presentation?",Alcoholic hepatitis,Autoimmune chronic active hepatitis,Carcinoma of the pancreas,Chronic hepatitis B infection,Chronic hepatitis D (delta) infection,A,"Tender hepatosplenomegaly and fever are consistent with a diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis; this frequently occurs with a  background of cirrhosis. Liver function tests typically show an AST elevated greater than the ALT with at least a 2:1 ratio, transaminases are typically only slightly elevated, rarely over 300 and virtually never over 500. The alkaline phosphatase may well be significantly elevated giving the liver profile an 'obstructive' appearance. The serology demonstrates evidence of chronic HBV infection, however, an undetectable HBV DNA load indicates that this is unlikely to be causing this acute presentation. HDV infection causes accelerated liver damage with lower HBV DNA loads however it still requires active HBV replication. Liver disease secondary to either would give rise to a 'hepatitic' rather than 'obstructive' liver panel. The same is true of autoimmune hepatitis. Whilst carcinoma of the head of the pancreas would cause an obstructive jaundice, it would not give rise to clinical features of chronic liver disease."
gastrointestinal system,148,A patient presents with haematemesis. An oesophagogastroduodenoscopy detects a bleed in the greater curvature of the stomach. Which of the following arteries is most likely to be the source of the bleeding?,Cystic artery,Right gastric artery,Right hepatic artery,Left gastroepiploic artery,Superior pancreaticoduodenal artery,D,"The superior pancreaticoduodenal artery, a branch of the gastroduodenal artery, supplies the head of the pancreas and the upper duodenum and anastomoses with the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery. The right hepatic artery supplies the right lobe of the liver and part of the caudate lobe. The right gastric artery is mainly found to supply the pylorus and the lesser curvature of the stomach. The right and left gastroepiploic arteries supply the greater curvature of the stomach."
gastrointestinal system,149,Which one of the following statements is true regarding inguinal hernias in children?,50% of hernias are bilateral,Approximately 50% of patients will develop a contralateral hernia,Are less common in preterm infants,Girls are more commonly affected than boys,In infants under one year approximately 50% present with incarceration,E,"Inguninal hernias are the commonest surgical condition of childhood. Approximately 2% of male infants will develop an inguinal hernia and 99% will be indirect. The male:female ratio is 9:1. Inguinal hernias are more common on the right and 10% are bilateral. Prematurity is a significant risk factor. The risk of incarceration is increased in infants and therefore a hernia presenting before 1 year of age requires urgent surgical assessment. Approximately 20% will develop a contralateral hernia. The role of contralateral groin exploration at the time of a unilateral herniotomy is controversial, and is not currently advised. The role of contralateral groin exploration at the time of a unilateral herniotomy is controversial."
gastrointestinal system,150,How would you initially assess someone if you suspect they have Coeliac disease?,Antiendomysial antibodies,GAD autoantibodies,Jejunal biopsy,Trial of gluten free diet,Antireticulin antibodies,A,Anti endomysial and tissue transglutaminase are detectable in the serum of patients with Coeliac disease. These are simple blood tests and much less invasive initially than performing a jejunal biopsy.  Antireticulin is not specific and GAD autoantibodies are observed in type 1 diabetes mellitus.
gastrointestinal system,151,A 55-year-old man presents having recently noticed a lump in his right groin which disappears when he is recumbent. It is accompanied by some discomfort. He has a chronic cough due to smoking. He has had an appendicectomy previously. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Epigastric hernia,Femoral hernia,Incisional hernia,Inguinal hernia,Spigelian hernia,D,Inguinal hernia is the most likely cause of a lump in the right groin in a patient of this age. The hernia protrudes through the external inguinal ring. It may:  go unnoticed for quite some time cause an ache resolve on lying flat  Femoral hernias are more common in females. The anatomical site is inconsistent with an epigastric hernia; and an incisional hernia following appendicectomy would be very unusual. This patient is at increased risk of hernias as he has a persistent cough due to his smoking. 
gastrointestinal system,152,"A 71-year-old woman has three months of vague lower abdominal pain and increasing abdominal distension. She has also noticed some blood in her stool, constipation and a sense of incomplete evacuation of her bowels She has lost 2 stone in weight in the past three months. Her abdomen is soft but a mass is felt deep in the left iliac fossa. A plain abdominal X ray shows a markedly dilated colon. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Crohn's disease,Diverticular mass,Left-sided colonic carcinoma,Sigmoid volvulus,Ulcerative colitis,C,"Elderly patients with per rectal bleeding, change in bowel habits, and weight loss should be considered to have colonic cancer unless proven otherwise. Increase in age is a risk factor for developing colonic cancer. The other risk factors include:  a family history of colon cancer familial adenomatous polyposis diet rich in red meat, and longstanding ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.  The clinical presentation of patients with colonic malignancy depends on the site of the tumour. Right-sided colonic carcinoma commonly presents with:  anaemia tiredness malaise pallor, and loss of weight.  The left sided colonic carcinoma presents with:  change in the bowel habits bleeding per rectum, and intestinal obstruction.  Rectal carcinoma, in addition to the features seen in left-sided colonic carcinoma, is associated with a sense of incomplete evacuation of the bowel (tenesmus). Tumours of the caecum affecting the ileocaecal valve can also present with symptoms of lower small bowel obstruction. Investigations for suspected colonic malignancy include:  full blood cell count renal function and electrolytes liver function tests (to rule out hepatic involvement) plain x ray of the abdomen, and ultrasound and CT scans.  Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is the commonly used tumour marker to diagnose colonic malignancy and subsequently to assess the progress, including recurrence. Surgery remains the mainstay of management of colonic tumours though a colonic stent maybe placed in left sided obstruction as a bridge to surgery. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy have their roles in selected patients. A temporary or a permanent colostomy is frequently required following the surgical treatment of left-sided colonic tumours."
gastrointestinal system,153,A patient presents with acute haematemesis. Which of the following would be regarded as an adverse prognostic feature in this case?,Age 55,A blood pressure of 118/78 mmHg,A further haematemesis during admission,An admission pulse rate of 80 beats per minute,No adherent clot on endoscopic examination,C,"Poor prognostic features of acute haematemesis include:  Advancing age (above 70) Signs of shock (tachycardia, SBP less than 100 mmHg) Adherent clot Visible vessel on endoscopic examination, and Concomitant illness, for example, cirrhosis, diabetes etc.  "
gastrointestinal system,154,A 66-year-old woman is scheduled to undergo a subtotal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma. Which of the following is an important procedure-related complication?,Bacterial overgrowth,Bilious vomiting,Constipation,Haemolytic anaemia,Pneumothorax,B,"A sub-total gastrectomy for a gastric tumour will involve a gastro-jejunostomy. The standard reconstruction is a simple retrocolic, loop gastro-jejunostomy to the remaining stomach (Polya gastrectomy). There is, obviously, no pylorus so bile can reflux into the much smaller stomach and there may be bilious vomiting. Severe bile reflux may require revision of the gastro-jejunostomy to a roux-en-y formation. Here the proximal jejunum (and bile) is disconnected from the loop gastro-jejunostomy and reattached at least 30 cm distally. Peristalsis should then direct the bile distally rather than back into the stomach. Constipation is not a recognised specific complication of gastrectomy but diarrhoea can occur as a result of large volumes of osmotically active foods entering the duodenum, or if there is impaired motility due to division of the vagus. A macrocytic anaemia may be B12 related, due to lack of intrinsic factor or as a result of an iron deficiency, as the post gastrectomy stomach does not convert iron from Fe^3+ to Fe^2+ and so it cannot be absorbed from the terminal ileum. Another important and relatively common complication is 'dumping syndrome'. This is characterised by faintness, sweating, abdominal pain and tachycardia. It is caused by a transient hypovolaemia following the passage of large volumes of osmotically active food into the duodenum, or by impaired glucose control as a result of large carbohydrate loads entering the small bowel."
gastrointestinal system,155,"A 64 year old female presents with right upper quadrant pain, fever and jaundice.  She has been suffering from right upper quadrant pain after eating for several months.  She is found to have elevated inflammatory markers and deranged LFTs with greatly elevated bilirubin and increased alkaline phosphatase.  She is commenced on IV antibiotics but is not responding well and bloods continue to worsen.  What is the next stage in her management?",Urgent endoscopic biliary decompression,Add in gentamicin to current regime,Cholecystectomy,MRCP,Change IV antibiotics,A,The patient presents with the classic Charcots triad of cholangitis.  The previous history of RUQ pain suggest previous history of gallstones and biliary colic.  This makes cholangitis the most likely diagnosis.  An US or CT abdomen can be utilised for the diagnosis of this and may exclude other diagnoses.  ERCP and MRCP should be utilised for identifying common bile duct stone however as ERCP is associated with some degree of mortality then it should be utilised only when intervention is also planned.  For cholangitis IV antibiotics should be commenced e.g. tazocin. However if the patient fails to respond to antibiotics then urgent endoscopic biliary decompression should be undertaken.  A cholecystectomy may then be indicated in the future.
gastrointestinal system,156,"A 23-year-old man was admitted with sudden onset rectal bleeding. This is his second such episode and two months previously he was also admitted for a similar problem. No specific diagnosis was made then and he was discharged as a case of andquot;pilesandquot;. There was no other significant medical history except for a few episodes of epistaxis. His preliminary blood tests revealed haemoglobin of 90 g/L, total leukocyte count of 8.2×109 /L, platelet count of 189000/µL. MCV was 69 µL and MCH was 22 pg. Clinical examination revealed a few red spots on his tongue and lips. What is the next best investigation to determine the aetiology of his disease?",Blood for autoimmune profile,Colonoscopy,Genetic study,Platelet function study,Serum iron profile,C,"This man has hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). He has arteriovenous malformations (AVM) on oral mucosa and there is epistaxis and GI bleeding. Thus, he satisfies the Curacao criteria for HHT. Usually, the clinical criteria is sufficient for diagnosing HHT. It is a genetic disease with autosomal dominant inheritance. Therefore, genetic testing is the most accurate test for diagnosis, although genetic study may be false negative because all the mutations causing this disease have not yet been ascertained. Colonoscopy will detect the AVMs in colon, but that is not a definitive diagnosis. Vasculitis and connective tissue disorders may have bleeding manifestations. These can be due to thrombocytopenia or direct vessel damage. Here, there is no thrombocytopenia. Also, epistaxis is uncommon in vasculitis except for granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Vasculitis usually has some typical skin rash. The presentation is not like platelet functional disorder. This man has iron deficiency anaemia. There is hypochromic microcytic anaemia, but doing a serum iron profile will not give us the diagnosis. It will only establish the iron deficiency anaemia, which is a consequence of chronic bleeding from different sites. Further reading: Olitsky SE.

gastrointestinal system,157,A 69-year-old man is seen in outpatients. He reports weight loss of 1 stone over three months but his history is otherwise unremarkable. On examination his abdomen is soft with no palpable masses. A PR examination is normal. His blood tests show:    Haemoglobin 80 g/L (120-160)   MCV 70 fL (80-96)    Which of the following is the most appropriate first line investigation for this patient?,Abdominal x ray and colonoscopy,CT scan of the abdomen and upper GI endoscopy,Sigmoidoscopy and upper GI endoscopy,Ultrasound scan of abdomen and colonoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy and colonoscopy,E,This man has weight loss and an unexplained microcytic anaemia. The likely site of blood loss is from the GI tract in absence of an alternative explanation. This may be due to an occult GI malignancy and therefore the initial investigations of choice are upper and lower GI endoscopy.
gastrointestinal system,158,"A 22-year-old man presented to the Emergency Department one week after returning from a six-month visit to Pakistan. He complained of fever, rigours, and headache. On examination, he was febrile (38°C) with a blood pressure of 115/65 mmHg, and a pulse of 100/minute. His abdomen was tender in the right upper quadrant.

Typhoid serology is unreliable. The differential diagnosis is mainly pyogenic or amoebic liver abscess. Pyogenic abscesses present with swinging pyrexia, neutrophilia and high inflammatory markers. Right-sided pleural effusions are common and blood cultures are often positive. The presentation of amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is very similar. Most patients do not have bowel symptoms at any time and amoebic cysts are found in stool in less than 50% of proven cases of ALA. Serology is the mainstay of diagnosis. Ultrasound scan would confirm most moderate-sized to large liver abscesses and could guide a diagnostic aspiration. Small lesions are best demonstrated by CT or MRI."

On examination he appears anxious; he is tachycardic at 105 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 122/90 mmHg. There is evidence of palmar erythema and spider naevi. Abdominal examination reveals hepatosplenomegaly and mild ascites. There is no evidence of melaena on rectal examination. He has a further episode of haematemesis while in the Emergency Department which the nursing staff estimates at approximately 500 ml. Which class of hypovolaemic shock is applicable to this patient's clinical state?,Class I,Class II,Class III,Class IV,Class V,B,"Class II of hypovolaemic shock by blood loss in adults is where there is 750-1500 ml blood loss with 15-30% loss of circulating blood volume. Systolic blood pressure may be normal or decreased but the diastolic is raised, heart rate is 100-120 beats per minute. Patients may have a normal respiratory rate but they are anxious or aggressive in view of the hypovolaemia. This patient is likely to have had a variceal haemorrhage.

gastrointestinal system,160,A 40-year-old man is referred with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD). Which of the following concerning GORD is correct?,Acid suppressant therapy should not be given continuously,Endoscopy is mandatory,"In the presence of Barrett's oesophagus, the risk of future malignancy can be assessed endoscopically without biopsy ",Oesophageal pH monitoring is a good guide to therapy,Symptoms do not correlate with mucosal status at endoscopy,E,"Symptoms of GORD do not correlate with the mucosal appearances at endoscopy. Although endoscopy should be performed in cases that are not clear-cut or do not respond to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), it is not mandatory. The risk with Barrett's and hence the diagnosis of Barrett's can only be clarified with biopsy. Monitoring of pH is not a good guide to therapy but symptomatic improvement is a good guide to the efficacy of therapy. PPIs can be given continuously where the diagnosis has been satisfactorily proven and relapse of symptoms persist after withdrawal."

What is the most appropriate next management for this man?",Barium enema,CT abdomen and pelvis,Colonoscopy,Laparotomy,Water soluble contrast enema,B,"This man's history, examination and x ray findings suggest large bowel obstruction. A CT scan should distinguish between a mechanical cause and pseudo-obstruction. If there is a sigmoid volvulus or pseudo-obstruction, a flexible sigmoidoscopy will often deflate the colon. Barium examinations should be avoided as he may require urgent surgery. As he has no signs of peritonitis, immediate laparotomy is not indicated without further investigation."
gastrointestinal system,163,"A 52 year old gentleman presents with symptoms of dyspepsia and heartburn. He does not drink excessively and is a non-smoker.  On examination there is some mild epigastric tenderness but there is no evidence of any supraclavicular nodes.  An endoscopy is performed and reveals an ulcer which is biopsied.  The pathology comes back and it looks like a low grade MALToma.  What is the most appropriate management of this patient?
",Radiotherapy,Omeprazole,H pylori eradication,Chemotherapy,Oesophagectomy,C,The diagnosis here is gastric MALTomas which in the majority of cases are associated with H pylori infection.  If these are low grade in the majority of cases H pylori eradication leads to resolution.  In severe cases where the MALTomas do not respond to this eradication there the next stage is chemotherapy with a rituximab plus or minus radiotherapy.
gastrointestinal system,164,Which one of the following is true of Meckel's diverticulum?,Can be diagnosed by a hydrogen breath test,Presents most commonly after the age of 5,Incidence of 5% of the population,May be implicated in Littre's hernia,Most commonly contains ectopic pancreatic tissue,D,"Two per cent of the population have Meckel's, which is an ileal remnant of vitello-intestinal duct. It may contain ectopic gastric mucosa (c. 60%) or pancreatic tissue (c. 6%). It is usually asymptomatic. Severe bleeding (acute) or obstruction and abdominal pain can occur. Symptoms (obstruction/volvulus/fistula/bleeding) most commonly occur before the age of 2. A technetium scan shows increased uptake in c. 70%. H2 breath test is for bacteria which split marker molecules releasing gas in the breath (for example, hydrogen 14/O2). It is not used for the diagnosis of a Meckel's where bacterial overgrowth is not a problem. Littre described a Meckel's diverticulum in a hernial sac in 1700, 81 years before Meckel was born."
gastrointestinal system,165,What differentiates Crohns disease from Ulcerative Colitis?,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Skip lesions,Weight loss,Mouth Ulcers,Bloody diarrhoea,B,"The key differentiating feature from these options is the skip lesions which are evident in Crohns disease but not ulcerative colitis. The pathology of both these differ for example in Crohns disease there is skip lesions and it can affect anywhere from the mouth to the anus. It is also tends to be a transmural inflammation and non caseating granuloma. In ulcerative colitis, only the colon is affected and it is a superficial inflammation and there is also no evidence of skip lesions between affected areas or non caseating granulomas. PSC is more common in UC but can occur in Crohns. Similarly the other options can be seen in both and are not good for differentiating between them."
gastrointestinal system,166,"A 71-year-old woman has 12 hours of severe, generalised abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Her blood pressure is 100/70 mm Hg and her heart rate is 102 BPM. She is in atrial fibrillation. Her abdomen is generally tender but there is minimal guarding and no peritonism. Her bowel sounds are absent.. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute diverticulitis,Crohn's disease,Mesenteric infarction,Perforated appendicitis,Perforated peptic ulcer,C,"The history and clinical features in this patient are very suggestive of mesenteric infarction. Although any of the three anterior abdominal aortic branches (coeliac, superior and the inferior mesenteric vessels) may occlude, it is the occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) which commonly causes mesenteric infarction. Despite the presence of collateral vessels for SMA, they may not be able to dilate sufficiently and swiftly enough to overcome the acute reduction in blood flow. The occlusion may be due to a thrombus or an embolus, and is seen in elderly patients who are in atrial fibrillation. Clinical features include persistent, severe and generalised abdominal pain. This condition is a surgical emergency as the patient rapidly becomes toxic and may die from septic shock unless the infarcted bowel is removed."
gastrointestinal system,167,A 69 year old male presents with pyrexia of unknown origin. He has no previous medical history. He has had some recent dental work. On examination he is found to be pyrexial with a temperature of 38.5oC. On auscultation of the heart there is evidence of a pansystolic murmur in the apical region. An echo is organised and reveals a vegetation and blood cultures reveal S. bovis. He is started on IV antibiotics. What investigation must be organised for this patient?,Colonoscopy,Repeat echo,Upper GI endoscopy,Repeat blood cultures,Nil required,A,The correct answer is colonoscopy as S. bovis endocarditis has been associated with an underlying colorectal cancer and thus a colonoscopy must be performed. If the colonoscopy is negative then an upper GI endoscopy should be performed. A liver ultrasound should also be performed as this is also associated with hepatobiliary disease.
gastrointestinal system,168,"A 32-year-old woman with Crohn's disease has a history of a right hemicolectomy for ileocolonic disease. Since the operation, she has had frequent diarrhoea but no blood in the stools. Investigations show:    ESR 10 mm/1st hour (0-20)   Platelets 240 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum CRP 7 mg/L (less than10)    Which is the best treatment?",Cholestyramine,Mesalazine,Metronidazole,Omeprazole,Prednisolone,A,"The ESR, CRP and platelet counts are not raised, indicating that this patient's symptoms are not due to active Crohn's. Also, the diarrhoea is not bloody which goes against active Crohn's colitis. Hence mesalazine or prednisolone would not be effective here. Metronidazole is typically given for peri-anal disease. The history includes a previous right hemicolectomy for ileocolonic disease. Loss of the terminal ileum frequently leads to bile salt malabsorption and treatment with the bile salt chelator cholestyramine quickly relieves the problem."
gastrointestinal system,169,A 38 year old male with known alcohol excess presents after vomiting up large amounts of fresh blood. On examination he is hypotensive and tachycardic and there is evidence of ascites and peripheral stigmata of liver disease.. He is fluid resuscitated. What else would you do initially?,IV somatostatin,Upper GI endoscopy,IV antibiotics,Sengstaken tube,IV terlipressin and antibiotics,E,Initially following fluid resuscitation IV Terlipressin should be given as it is a splanchnic vasoconstrictor and this aids in reducing bleeding from varices. IV antibiotics should also be given as there can be translocation of bacteria during variceal bleeding and this is to reduce risk of sepsis. These steps should be performed initially but ultimately the patient requires and upper GI endoscopy and banding. A sengstaken tube is only used as a last resort when the patient continues to bleed despite banding.
gastrointestinal system,170,An 18-year-old female is admitted with abdominal discomfort and is noted to have a bilirubin of 23 µmol/L (0-18). Which one of the following findings is compatible with a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome?,Decreasing bilirubin during fasting,Elevated alkaline phosphatase,Excess urobilinogen in the urine,Increased conjugated bilirubin,Normal liver histology on biopsy,E,"Gilbert's syndrome is associated with an isolated elevation of unconjugated bilirubin due to mild deficiency of glucuronyl transferase, with normal liver architecture and consequently no elevation in urobilinogen. Alkaline phosphatase is normal. Bilirubin concentrations are variable, and jaundice can be precipitated by drugs and infection. It is the commonest form of familial non-haemolytic hyperbilirubinaemia affecting 2-5% of the population, and is now thought to be inherited in an autosomally recessive manner, although other abnormalities may contribute to phenotype."
gastrointestinal system,171,A 30-year-old woman presents with jaundice and her investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 90 g/L (115-165)   Reticulocyte count 180 ×10^9/L (25-85)   Serum bilirubin 50 µmol/L (1-22)    Her blood film reveals the presence of spherocytes. Which of the following is the next most useful investigation?,Abdominal ultrasound scan,Direct antiglobulin test,Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity,Haemoglobin electrophoresis,Red cell osmotic fragility,B,"The results given indicate a haemolytic anaemia of which spherocytes are typical and given the age of the patient the most likely cause is immune. The first step in analysis of a spherocytic hemolytic anaemia is to determine whether the process is hemolytic or not. The best way to do it is a direct antiglobulin test. If negative, one could go on to confirm HS with other tests. The osmotic fragility test is unreliable and is no longer recommended in routine clinical practice. Osmotic gradient ektacytometry is used to differentiate hereditary spherocytosis from hereditary stomatocytosis, but is only available in specialised laboratories. If the diagnosis is equivocal, the cryohaemolysis test and EMA binding can be used. In atypical cases, gel electrophoresis analysis of erythrocyte membranes is the test of choice."
gastrointestinal system,172,A 58-year-old patient presents with altered bowel habits and bleeding per rectum. Examination and sigmoidoscopy showed an ulcer. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Colorectal carcinoma,Celiac disease,Crohns disease,UC,IBS,A,"Age, altered bowel habits, bleeding per rectum and isolated ulcer on sigmoidoscopy suggest colorectal cancer"
gastrointestinal system,173,A patient with malnourishment develops cardiac failure after being commenced on total parenteral nutrition. What treatment should have been given?,Phosphate Replacement,Sodium Replacement,Zinc Replacement,Magnesium Replacement,Potassium Replacement,A,When refeeding syndrome occurs this is secondary to phosphate deficiency. This is because when glucose is given then high levels of insulin lead to phosphate being transported into the cells and a large drop in phosphate levels which can lead to congestive cardiac failure.
gastrointestinal system,174,"A 35 year old male who has lived in Barbados for the last few years presents with diarrhoea, which sometimes difficult to flush away. This has caused about 5 kg weight loss. He is very fatigued and feverish at times. He has also noticed some ankle oedema. On examination he looks cachectic. Bloods reveal a macrocytic anaemia, low potassium and calcium levels and albumin levels. A jejunal biopsy reveals incomplete villous atrophy and inflammatory infiltrate. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Tuberculosis,Chronic pancreatitis,Tropical sprue,Crohns disease,Coeliac disease,C,"The history, having lived in Barbados and clinical findings of malabsorption are most indicative of tropical sprue. However all of the options could explain the symptoms and the key finding if Jejunal biopsy with the characteristic incomplete villous atrophy unlike coeliac disease which leads to total atrophy."
gastrointestinal system,175,"A 25 year old female of African origin presents due to intermittent diarrhoea, crampy abdominal pain, bloating , flatulence and nausea. She thinks it may be worse after she eats certain foods. Bloods are normal and a flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed and is normal. What is the next stage in the management?",Gluten free diet,Colonoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,Dairy free diet,Advice regarding IBS,D,"This patient presents with symptoms of IBS. However as she is of African descent which has an increased rate of lactose intolerance, it may be worthwhile having a trial of a dairy free diet to see if this improves her symptoms as lactose intolerance presents in a similar fashion."
gastrointestinal system,176,Which of the following is true regarding diverticular disease of the colon?,Is not associated with heavy rectal bleeding,Is rarely found in patients with recto-sigmoid cancer,May give rise to perianal fistulae,Often presents with abdominal pain,The diverticula occur most frequently on the mesenteric aspect of the colon,D,"Diverticular disease is often a cause of PR blood loss and may present with pain, particularly with diverticulitis. Diverticula are found most commonly on the antimesenteric border of the colon (specifically on the mesenteric side of the antimesenteric taeniae coli)"
gastrointestinal system,177,A 72-year-old man presents with intermittent difficulty in swallowing with regurgitation of stale food materials. Sometimes he wakes up at night with a feeling of suffocation. Choose the single most likely cause of dysphagia?,Benign stricture,Esophageal carcinoma,Esophageal spasm,Pharyngeal pouch,Systemic sclerosis,D,"In benign stricture, esophageal carcinoma and systemic sclerosis there is persistent dysphagia not intermittent. In oesophageal spasm there may be intermittent dysphagea but there will be no regurgitation of stale food material and no nocturnal regurgitation in recumbency. The clinical picture described is wellknown features of pharyngeal pouch"
gastrointestinal system,178,"A 35-year-old woman with Crohn's disease has had several episodes of relapse which are refractory to oral and rectal steroids, and to azathioprine. She presents to hospital with severe bloody diarrhoea of three days duration, associated with abdominal pain and perianal ulceration. On examination she looks pale and lethargic and baseline observations reveal BP 80/60, HR 120. All her other observations are normal. She is admitted, given intravenous fluids, and following further unsuccessful attempts at medical management, undergoes colectomy and resection of a significant amount of ileum, with end ileostomy formation. You review her on the ward three days later when she complains of severe watery diarrhoea whenever she attempts to eat. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Hypocalcaemia,Ongoing active Crohn's disease,Short bowel syndrome,Vitamin D deficiency,Zinc deficiency,C,"Short bowel syndrome occurs when there has been resection of a significant portion of the small intestine, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients. Management should initially focus on replacement of fluids and electrolytes. Gastric hypersecretion should be managed with proton pump inhibitors, and loperamide or codeine can be used to slow gastric and bowel transit time. The patient should initially be kept nil by mouth to reduce the osmotic load. Specialist teams, including dieticians, should then be consulted regarding the most appropriate feeding to initiate. The bowel often adapts after the initial post-operative period and refeeding should be initiated slowly with the aim of the patient having a normal oral diet.  As there has been a significant bowel resection, which has obviously been carefully considered following unsuccessful medical management, it is unlikely the treating time would have left the patient with bowel actively affected by Crohn's disease. Hypocalcaemia, vitamin D deficiency, and zinc deficiency can all result from small bowel syndrome, but these are longer-term complications and do not typically present so acutely, and not with this clinical picture. "
gastrointestinal system,179,"A 30-year-old female is brought to Accident and Emergency by her family; she is suffering from severe confusion and muscle twitches. They report a year long history of diarrhoea and bloating, which the patient has declined to visit the GP regarding. They also report approximately 10 kg of weight loss in the same time. Of note in her past medical history is bipolar disorder, for which she takes citalopram and lithium.  Bloods reveal:    Sodium 160 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L)   Potassium 3.0 mmol/L (3.5-4.9 mmol/L)   Creatinine 130 μmol/L (60-110 μmol/L)   Urea 10 mmol/L (2.5-7.5 mmol/L)   Adjusted calcium 2.3 mmol/L (2.2-2.6 mmol/L)   ALT 43 U/L (7-55 U/L)   ALP 65 U/L (45-115 U/L)   Bilirubin 12 μmol/L (less than22 μmol/L)   Albumin 37 g/L (35-55 g/L)   Haemoglobin 129 g/L (115-140 g/L)   White cell count 6.1 ×10^9/L (4-11 ×10^9/L)   Platelets 198 ×10^9/L (150-400 ×10^9/L)   Neutrophils 4.4 ×10^9/L (1.8-8 ×10^9/L)   CRP less than5 mg/L (less than5 mg/L)    Following acute management of her electrolyte abnormalities, she undergoes colonoscopy which demonstrates multiple dark pigmented areas in the descending colon. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Drug induced colitis,Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP),Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC),Melanosis coli,Microscopic colitis,D,"Melanosis coli is a benign condition associated with chronic laxative use, most commonly osmotic laxatives. The pigmentation is due to lipofuscin formation and accumulation in macrophages. It is most commonly identified at endoscopy and requires no treatment other than counselling on laxative use. The hypernatraemia and hypokalaemia are likely a result of chronic diarrhoea, which has also contributed to the weight loss.  Microscopic and drug induced colitis would not present in such a way with bloody painful stools to be expected.  Both FAP and HNPCC would present with numerous tumours within the bowel lumen and usually a family history of bowel cancer.  "
gastrointestinal system,180,"A 52-year-old male is admitted with haematemesis and melaena. Examination reveals that he is icteric, confused with a flapping tremor, has signs of chronic liver disease, a pulse rate of 110 bpm, and blood pressure of 100/70 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals ascites. An urgent endoscopy reveals small oesophageal varices without evidence of bleeding, but an oozing portal hypertensive gastropathy. Which of the following measures would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient?",Endoscopic banding,Endoscopic injection of ethanolamine,Intravenous terlipressin,Intravenous vitamin K,Oral propranolol,C,"Portal hypertensive gastropathy can result in upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis, specifically those with portal hypertension. It is characterised by a mosaic pattern within the stomach, usually in a proximal location. It mainly causes chronic blood loss and anaemia, but can cause acute haemorrhage. First-line treatment for chronic haemorrhage is a non-selective beta blocker (such as propranolol) and iron supplementation. If the bleeding or anaemia are not controlled with this, then transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) or shunt surgery are indicated. Management of acute bleeding, as in this case, should be with a vasoactive drug (such as somatostatin or terlipressin). If the bleeding responds, the patient must be switched to a non-selective beta blocker. Shunt therapy should be considered in patients who rebleed despite adequate beta blocker therapy. The endoscopy shows small varices with no evidence of bleeding but diffuse oozing of blood. Hence endoscopic measures like banding for small varices will not be useful. Ethanolamine is thought to be useful in peptic ulcer disease, but is less useful in portal hypertensive gastopathy. There is probably no evidence that vitamin K is helpful, unless the clotting is deranged (which we are not told is the case here). "
gastrointestinal system,181,In which of the following circumstances are radiological appearances more suggestive of ulcerative colitis than Crohn's disease?,A barium enema shows rectal sparing,A stricture is seen,Colonic involvement is discontinuous,There is a loss of colonic haustrations,Tracking of contrast within the bowel wall is present,D,"Ulcerative colitis begins in the rectum and progresses proximally. Conversely, the rectum is usually spared in Crohn's disease. The characteristic finding in ulcerative colitis is continuous, fine mucosal ulceration with loss of the haustral pattern. In Crohn's disease, there are discrete and fissured ulcers. These often track deep into the bowel wall and may progress to sinus and fistula formation. Strictures (often multiple) and skip lesions are also features of Crohn's disease."
gastrointestinal system,182,A 68-year-old male presents with alcoholic cirrhosis complicated by mild ascites. Which of the following features is likely in this patient?,Increased serum sodium,Increased vascular resistance,Reduced renin concentrations,Reduced urinary potassium excretion,Reduced urinary sodium excretion,E,"Patients with cirrhosis are frequently hyponatraemic. This is a function of an inability to excrete free water (increased ADH levels and systemic vasodilation contribute, but the underlying mechanism is complex and not entirely understood). Secondary hyperaldosteronism will result in total body sodium overload but not necessarily hypernatraemia. Remember that the sodium level is a concentration, therefore if the amount of solvent (water) is increased then it will not necessarily rise. The development of ascites is related to this process but is not the cause of dilution. There is decreased vascular resistance, increased plasma volume and low serum sodium."
gastrointestinal system,183,Which of the following is correct regarding congenital diaphragmatic hernia?,Is more common on the right than the left,Is rarely associated with other congenital anomalies,May be diagnosed readily on auscultation,Rarely presents with respiratory distress,Usually occurs through the foramen of Bochdalek,E,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernias occur in approximately 1 in 4,000 live births. Ninety percent occur in the posterior portion of the diaphragm through the foramen of Bochdalek of which 90% are on the left (the liver is on the right side so may be the reason the majority pass through the left side of the diaphragm). The commonest clinical presentation is with respiratory distress in the neonatal period and due to pulmonary hypoplasia and compression. The abdomen often has a scaphoid appearance. About 40% of patients have associated congenital anomalies. The diagnosis can be confirmed radiologically with bowel loops seen in the chest. Neonates usually require sedation, ventilation and intestinal decompression prior to surgery between 36 and 72 hours after birth."
gastrointestinal system,184,Which is the most common feature and clinical hallmark of carcinoid syndrome?,Bronchospasm,Cardiac valvular lesions,Cutaneous flushing,Diarrhoea,Venous telangiectasia,C,"Episodic flushing is the clinical hallmark of carcinoid syndrome occurring in 85% of patients. It mainly involves the face, neck, and upper chest. In severe cases flushes are accompanied by a drop in blood pressure and an increase in heart rate. The clinical manifestations of carcinoid syndrome are dependent upon the combination of bioactive substances secreted. One of the main features of enterochromaffin cells is the production, storage, and secretion of serotonin. When serotonin and other products are released into the portal circulation they undergo hepatic metabolism and do not usually cause systemic symptoms or signs. However, with liver metastases or with primary lesions in the bronchus and/or ovaries, the systemic features of carcinoid syndrome manifest. Carcinoid syndrome occurs in less than 10% of patients, typically with cutaneous flushing of the face, neck and upper chest. Up to 75% of patients have diarrhoea. Less often patients may develop cardiac valvular abnormalities mainly affecting the right side of the heart, such as tricuspid regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, and pulmonary stenosis. Bronchoconstriction and venous telangiectasia may also occur. "
gastrointestinal system,185,"A 41-year-old woman comes to the gastroenterology clinic for review. She underwent extensive resection of her distal small bowel for Crohn's disease around three months earlier. She is still suffering from diarrhoea and is worried that her Crohn's disease is still active. On examination, her BP is 105/70 mmHg with a pulse of 80. Her abdomen is soft and non-tender. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 104 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 4.5 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 195 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 3.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 140 μmol/L (60-120)   C reactive protein 9 mg/L (less than10)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Active Crohn's disease,Bacterial overgrowth syndrome,Bile acid diarrhoea,Ischaemic colitis,Short bowel syndrome,C,"We are told that this patient has undergone extensive distal small bowel resection, but she does not have an ileostomy. As such, it is most likely that she has colonic bile acid irritation leading to diarrhoea. Short bowel syndrome is usually associated with voluminous diarrhoea of up to 5 litres per day, normally through the ileostomy outlet. There is no indication of active Crohn's disease, and bacterial overgrowth syndrome is usually associated with symptoms of abdominal bloating. Cholestyramine may be effective for the treatment of bile acid diarrhoea."
gastrointestinal system,186,Which of the following is correct regarding pancreatic carcinoma?,Is associated with diabetes insipidus,Is the third most common cause of death due to cancer,Presents too late for curative surgical intervention in over 90% of cases,Produces progressive jaundice occurs in less than 40%,Usually presents with jaundice and a palpable tender gall bladder,C,"Pancreatic carcinoma is the 10th most common cancer and its incidence appears to be increasing. There are around 4000 cases per year in both men and women with almost equal incidence^1. Over 90% present late with no chance of cure, and only 25% present with Courvoisier's law, which states that if, in painless jaundice, the gallbladder is palpable, the cause will not be gallstones. Progressive jaundice occurs in over 75% and only 5% will present with pancreatitis. It is unclear whether diabetes mellitus is an aetiological factor or if pancreatic cancer induces glucose intolerance. It is the fourth commonest cause of cancer mortality in men, after lung, prostate and bowel cancer. "
gastrointestinal system,187,"A 67-year-old man is vomiting large volumes of fresh blood. He is in hypovolaemic shock. Following resuscitation, an upper GI endoscopy is performed. A bleeding vessel is injected in the posterior aspect of the first part of the duodenum. Which vessel is the cause of the bleeding?",Gastroduodenal artery,Inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery,Left hepatic artery,Right gastric artery,Right gastroepiploic artery,A,The gastroduodenal artery is a posterior relation of the first part of the duodenum. Erosion of an ulcer through the arterial wall results in severe haemorrhage. The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The gastroduodenal artery is a branch of the hepatic artery.
gastrointestinal system,188,"A 76-year-old man presents with weight loss, dark urine, and pale stools which are difficult to flush away. An excess of which of the following would account for this history?",Conjugated bilirubin,Hyperbilirubinaemia,Stercobilinogen,Unconjugated bilirubin,Urobilinogen,A,The history is suggestive of obstructive jaundice. In this condition there is an excess of conjugated bilirubin in the plasma which is water soluble and can be excreted in the urine. Reduced stercobilinogen causes the typical pale stools. Unconjugated bilirubin is strongly bound to albumin and is not water soluble so is not excreted in the urine. Urobilinogen is formed from stercobilinogen that escapes into the plasma from the colon and is colourless.
gastrointestinal system,189,A 35-year-old man is referred to the gastroenterology clinic with persistent pain in the rectum. The patient reports recurrent painful oral ulcers. On direct questioning he admits to red and painful eyes. He also reports he has recently noticed an ulcer over his scrotum. On examination there is evidence of oral aphthous ulceration; abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the right iliac fossa and a bruit on auscultation of the abdomen. Rectal examination demonstrates perianal ulceration. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Behçet's syndrome,Crohn's disease,HIV infection,Syphilis,Tuberculosis,A,"Behçet's syndrome is a vasculitis of unknown pathophysiology. Onset of disease is typically in the third and fourth decades. It is more common in men in the Middle East and women in the Far East. Diagnostic criteria include oral aphthous ulcers which are painful, recurrent and non-scarring and two of:  genital ulceration uveitis pustular vasculitis and synovitis, and meningoencephalitis.  And the exclusion of inflammatory bowel disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, Reactive arthritis and herpes. Aphthoid ulcers can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract but are most commonly found in the ileo-caecal region, right colon and oesophagus.^1 The presence of genital ulcers and the absence of significant bowel symptoms both go against a diagnosis of Crohn's disease, rather than the presence of an abdominal bruit which is a rare finding in vasculitis.^2 "
gastrointestinal system,190,"A 70-year-old male is one day post-operative, following an elective right hemicolectomy. He has a serum potassium of 2.5 mmol/L (3.5-4.9). Which one of the following statements is true?",A 12 lead ECG may show peaked T waves,Hypokalaemia may cause cardiac arrest,Oral potassium supplements will correct his deficit,Potassium can safely be given by infusion at 60 mmol/hour,Up to 20 mmol of potassium chloride should be added to his daily maintenance intravenous fluids,B,"Hypokalaemia is defined as a serum potassium of less than 3.5 mmol/L, and symptoms usually occur below 2.5 mmol/L. A common cause of post-operative hypokalaemia is inadequate potassium intake, for example, intravenous fluid therapy without sufficient potassium supplementation. The daily maintenance potassium requirement is 0.5-1.0 mmol/kg per day. ECG changes are common and includeL  T wave inversion S-T segment depression Q-T and P-R prolongation, and U waves.  Cardiac arrest may occur if attempts to raise the serum potassium are delayed and hypokalaemia is a cause of pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Treatment of hypokalaemia in this patient should be with intravenous potassium, as he may still be on restricted oral intake or even be nil by mouth. Up to 40 mmol of potassium chloride can be added to each litre bag of fluid, but this method may not raise the serum potassium quickly enough. Therefore, it should be given by intravenous infusion at a rate not exceeding 40 mmol/hour. In severe cases this upper limit may be exceeded with ECG monitoring, for example, in critical care areas, as there is a high risk of dysrhythmias, especially ventricular fibrillation."
gastrointestinal system,191,A 34-year-old man has an intermittent epigastric pain for 3 weeks. It is worse by food but helped by some tablets he obtained from the pharmacy. He had a similar episode 3 years ago and his doctor gave him a course of 3 types of tablets at the time. What is the most appropriate next investigation?,Abdomen US,Barium meal,Serum H.Pylori antibodies,C13 urea breath test,Upper GI endoscopy,D,Patient was all right for 3yrs after eradication therapy. Now symptoms again may indicate recurrence of H. Pylori infection which can be demonstrated by C13 urea breath test. Serum antibody persist (IgG) for long and not reliable for recheck
gastrointestinal system,192,A 60 year old gentleman presents with dysphagia. This initially began with solids and he is now gradually finding it increasingly more difficult to swallow liquids. He has also noticed that he has lost several kilos in weight over the past few months. He has no previous medical history however is a heavy drinker and smoker. On examination he looks cachectic and there is evidence of tenderness in the epigastrium. What investigation should be organised?,CT scan,Colonoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,Abdominal ultrasound scan,Barium swallow,C,The history in this case is indicative of an oesophageal CA and there is an increased risk factor of this with the heaving smoking and alcohol consumption. An upper GI endoscopy must be performed to assess this and to obtain biopsies of the tissue. CT abdomen although useful for assessing the stage will not provide evidence of a tissue diagnosis. A barium swallow is useful for identifying dysmotility disorders although is not as useful in detecting underlying malignancy and again does not allow a tissue diagnosis to be confirmed.
gastrointestinal system,193,"A 70-year-old woman comes to the gastroenterology clinic for review. She has been referred by her GP with a microcytic anaemia, and has recently undergone an upper GI endoscopy that demonstrated a small scar thought to be from a healed duodenal ulcer. Helicobacter pylori screening was negative. Other past history of note includes hypertension for which she is taking indapamide, and asthma for which she uses a Seretide inhaler. Examination reveals a BP of 135/70 mmHg, pulse is 75 bpm and regular. Breath sounds are normal, abdomen is soft and non tender, and her BMI is 25 kg/m^2. PR reveals an empty rectum with no masses. Investigations:    Haemoglobin 92 g/L (115-160)   Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 72 fL (76-100)   White cell count (WCC) 8.2 ×10^9/L (6-10)   Platelet count 210 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 138 mmol/L (135-145)   K 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5.5)   Creatinine 121 µmol/L (60-90)    2/3 faecal occult blood samples positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",Barium enema,Capsule endoscopy,Colonoscopy,CT abdomen,Sigmoidoscopy,C,"The absence of lower GI symptoms raises the possibility of a right-sided colonic lesion resulting in the microcytic anaemia seen here. The best way to rule out an underlying carcinoma is with a colonoscopy after adequate bowel preparation. Age-specific and sex-specific incidence rates for the UK (2009-2011) for colon cancer suggest this approximates to 3.5% per year in the 70-74 year age group. For this reason, further investigation is essential, especially given positive faecal occult blood (FOB) samples. Sigmoidoscopy will not adequately visualise the whole colon, and barium enema is not as sensitive for small polyps versus colonoscopy, although barium enema would be an alternative option if colonoscopy is not tolerated. CT abdomen with contrast also runs the risk of missing a small right-sided lesion, but CT colonography (which includes full bowel preparation) is a reasonable alternative in those unable to tolerate colonoscopy. Capsule endoscopy is generally most useful for imaging the small bowel, where it has an important role in visualising angiodysplasia."
gastrointestinal system,194,"A 24-year-old woman was referred with tiredness and intermittent bloody diarrhoea and a past history of cerebral venous thrombosis. On examination, the sclera of the right eye was inflamed and multiple mouth ulcers were noted. At the colonoscopy, which confirmed colitis, two large vulval ulcers were noted. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Behçet's disease,Crohn's disease,HIV infection,Syphilis,Ulcerative colitis,A,"This is a classical description of the presentation of Behçet's, with oral and genital ulceration, colitis and scleritis."
gastrointestinal system,195,"An 8 year old boy presented with bloody diarrhoea, fever and abdominal pain.   He is found to have haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Inflammatory bowel disease,Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,Henoch Schonlein Purpura,Gastroenteritis,Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome,E,"Haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure is classical of Haemolytic uraemic syndrome.  In the majority of cases it is secondary of E. coli 0157 which leads to bloody diarrhoea. TTP is associated with these features but also neurological features."
gastrointestinal system,196,"A 40-year-old woman presents with dysphagia and weight loss for three months as well as vomiting, which she describes as containing recognisable pieces of food. She reports that the symptoms are progressive and that it is predominantly solid food which she cannot tolerate, but on further questioning she reports she has had trouble with liquids too. A CXR shows what looks like a fluid level behind the right heart border. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Achalasia,Intususseption,Multiple sclerosis,Oesophageal adenocarcinoma,Pharyngeal pouch,A,"Achalasia is the inability of the lower oesophageal sphincter to relax, causing a functional stricturing of the oesophagus. Patients usually complain of dysphagia to both solids and liquids though the former is slightly more common. Chest x ray may demonstrate the presence of a fluid level behind the heart. Barium swallow may show a classical bird beak appearance, and treatment is primarily endoscopic or surgical with oesophageal dilatation or surgical myotomy. Pharnygeal pouch is an option in this scenario however patients classically report a gurgling sensation in their throat and also complain of halitosis. Oesophageal cancer is classically associated with significant weight loss and progressive dysphagia to solids and then liquids. One would expect other systemic symptoms if MS were the underlying diagnosis. Intusussepetion is a predominantly seen in children, where one are of bowel is invaginated by the other producing bloody andquot;redcurrant jellyandquot; stools."
gastrointestinal system,197,"A 42-year-old woman comes to the hepatology clinic for review. She has suffered increasing lethargy over the past few months to the point that she is barely able to hold down her job, and most recently has developed intermittent nausea, anorexia, and itching. Past medical history of note includes Hashimoto's thyroiditis for which she takes thyroxine 100 mcg per day. On examination her BP is 125/80 mmHg, and pulse is 72 bpm and regular. There are scratch marks over the abdomen related to the itching and you notice she has xanthelasma. Abdominal examination reveals 1 finger breadth hepatomegaly, and her BMI is 26. Investigations:    Hb 110g/l 115-160   WCC 9.9 ×10^9/L 6-10   PLT 135×10^9/L 150-400   Na 139 mmol/l 135-145   K 4.2 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 85 µmol/l 50-90   ESR 45 mm/hr less than10   Ca2+ 2.2 mmol/l 2.1-2.65   Albumin 32g/l 30-50   Total protein 75g/l 60-85   Alkaline phosphatase 291 U/l 40-120   ALT 55 U/l 0-20   Bilirubin 26 µmol/l less than22    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune hepatitis,Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Viral hepatitis,C,"The answer is primary biliary cirrhosis, (PBC). Lethargy and itching are prominent early features in PBC, which is most commonly seen in middle aged women (especially those with coexistent autoimmune thyroid disease). The elevation in alkaline phosphatase coupled with a smaller rise in ALT is typical of the condition, and the difference between total protein and albumin raises the possibility of elevated immunoglobulins, also seen in PBC. Anti-mitochondrial antibodies are seen in association with PBC at a titre of 1 in 40 or higher. Ursodeoxycholic acid may be of value in treating PBC if started very early, but ultimately patients usually require a liver transplant. Autoimmune hepatitis is less likely because there is a more marked elevation in alkaline phosphatase with a much smaller rise in ALT, and cholestatic symptoms would be less common. NASH is less likely here given the relatively normal BMI. It can be difficult to differentiate between primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and PBC, but PSC is more common in men and often in combination with inflammatory bowel disease. There are no risk factors to suggest viral hepatitis reported in this patient's history, and a more prominent rise in ALT would be expected."
gastrointestinal system,198,Which of the following is correct regarding pyloric stenosis?,Bile-stained vomitus is an important symptom,Can be misdiagnosed as a duodenal atresia,Reluctance to feed is a common feature,Usually presents at the age of 3-6 months,Weight loss is an important feature,E,Pyloric stenosis is a congenital obstruction of the stomach. It more commonly affects boys than girls. Vomiting usually starts in the 2nd or 3rd week of life and patients usually present by 6 weeks. Babies vomit and therefore lose weight but remain hungry and so feed enthusiastically. Differential diagnosis for pyloric stenosis are reflux and overfeeding. The vomitus is not bile stained as it may be in duodenal atresia (depending on the site of obstruction). In pyloric stenosis gastric peristaltic waves may be visible and a small 'olive' may be palpable. These features would not be present in duodenal atresia. Abdominal x rays in patients with duodenal atresia may show the characteristic double bubble sign which is as a result of distension of the stomach and duodenum with a constricting pylorus between them.  Ultrasound is the standard investigation of pyloric stenosis. This should demonstrate the pyloric 'tumour' and confirm the clinical diagnosis.
gastrointestinal system,199,A 72-year-old man is discharged from hospital following a stroke. During his stay he was started on several new medications. He presents with diarrhoea. Which of the following medications is most likely to be the cause?,Clopidogrel,Enalapril,Metformin,Pioglitazone,Simvastatin,C,Although all the medications listed could cause gastrointestinal disturbances it is metformin that is by far the most likely.
gastrointestinal system,200,Which of the following is activated by cholera toxin?,Adenylate cyclase,Guanylate cyclase,Peroxisome proliferator receptor (PPAR) gamma,Sodium/potassium ATPase,The glucose-sodium transporter,A,Cholera toxin activates adenylate cyclase with generation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).
gastrointestinal system,201,You are reviewing a patient who had an angiogram via a right groin puncture. He was well post-procedure but developed pain in the right flank with bruising in the the groin and flank. On examination he is tender in the flank and there is a lump in the right groin. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Critical limb,Perforated peptic ulcer,Right femoral pseudoaneurysm,Right retroperitoneal haematoma,Ruptured AAA,D,This patient has a large retroperitoneal haematoma from bleeding from the puncture site or a ruptured iliac artery during wire placement. This is an unusual complication from catheterisation and is associated with the puncture of the artery above the inguinal ligament. He will require a CT angiogram or angiogram to assess the extent of bleeding and decide on further treatment. Femoral pseudo-aneurysm is a more common recognised complication that may occur in 0.5-2% of femoral catheterisation. This can be treated by ultrasound guided compression.
gastrointestinal system,202,A patient being investigated for anaemia has been found from one of the biopsies to have anti parietal antibodies present. Where is the biopsy likely to have been taken from?,Terminal Ileum,Duodenum,Body of Stomach,Antrum of Stomach,Jejunum,C,This patient has Pernicious anaemia and anti parietal antibodies are present. These can be found in the blood and also are most likely to be found in the body of the stomach as parietal cells are predominantly located in the body of the stomach.
gastrointestinal system,203,A 55 year old patient has chronic liver disease secondary to alcohol and hepatitis C infection.  He presents with decompensated liver disease with increasing ascites.  There is no evidence of GI bleeding.  His AFP is normal.  An ultrasound shows a focal lesion within the liver.  What is the most likely reason for this decompensation?,Hepatocellular carcinoma,Upper GI bleed,Constipation,Alcohol binge,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,A,In any patient with decompensated liver disease then HCC should be considered.  If there is evidence of a focal liver lesion as in this case then HCC should be suspected even if the AFP is not elevated as in up to 20% of cases AFP may not be elevated.  Obviously all the options can lead to a decompensation and should be excluded however with the finding of a focal liver lesion HCC is the most likely cause.
gastrointestinal system,204,Which of the following is correct regarding reflux of gastric contents into the oesophagus?,Can be excluded by a normal appearance at endoscopy,Can be improved by Helicobacter pylori eradication,Is a cause of asthma,Is neutralised by bicarbonate secreted by the oesophageal mucosa,Occurs during transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter,E,"Diagnosis is based predominantly on history, with a proportion of patients with reflux disease having a normal endoscopy. H. pylori eradication is indicated in long term healing of gastric and duodenal ulceration, but not reflux disease. Whilst it is true the oesophageus secretes bicarbonate, the statement here is not true. It is a fairly weak defence and is not able to neutralise any gastric contents which reflux up the oesophagus. More effective Brunner's glands which secrete alkaline mucus are found in the duodenum. The link between asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease is a complex one, but a recent systemic review indicates that there is a significant association but there is a lack of data on the direction of causality. It is therefore not possible to conclude that GORD is a cause of asthma. "
gastrointestinal system,205,"A 50 year old gentleman presents with intermittent diarrhoea and bloating. He has some associated anorexia and weight loss. On further questioning he also admits to having intermittent pains in his joints and a chronic cough. On examination his abdomen is soft and non tender but there is evidence of lymph node in his axilla, supraclavicular and groin regions. His bloods reveal a low haemoglobin and albumin. A small bowel biopsy is performed and shows expanded villi with PAS positive macrophages. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Tropical sprue,Lymphoma,Coeliac disease,Crohns disease,Whipples disease,E,The history and clinical findings and small biopsy results reveal the most likely cause is Whipples disease. The malabsorption leads to anaemia and hypoalbuminemia. Whipples disease is caused by T. whippelii and the main stay for treatment is amoxicillin or co trimoxazole.
gastrointestinal system,206,"A 25-year-old man who is known to have diabetes mellitus and suffers from recurrent chest infections is referred to the gastroenterology team with chronic diarrhoea. The letter from his GP states the patient has had persistently abnormal liver function tests over the last three months and an abdominal ultrasound scan showed a fatty liver and gallstones. Given the most likely diagnosis, what is the disease prevalence in northern Europe?",0.25,0.736111111,2.125,3.513888889,1:10000,C,"This patient has cystic fibrosis which has a disease prevalence of 1:3000 northern Europeans and gene carriage 1:25. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disorder which results from mutations in the gene for the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator). This is a cAMP-activated chloride channel found in secretory epithelia. Patients have dry protein-rich secretions which lead to complications of the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems. CF is the commonest cause of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The disease presents with failure to thrive, steatorrhoea, and abdominal pain. Diabetes mellitus can occur. Twenty per cent have a fatty liver and gallstones are seen in 15% of young adults with the disease. Patients may also develop secondary biliary cirrhosis with mucus plugging of bile ducts and portal hypertension. Diagnosis is usually clinical based on the pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations, family history, and a positive sweat test. Confirmation is with genetic studies. Management requires a multi-disciplinary team approach with attention to nutrition. Vitamin deficiencies require replacement and pancreatic enzyme supplements are given for exocrine insufficiency. There has been success with lung and liver transplantation; gene therapy remains the ultimate goal for treatment. "
gastrointestinal system,207,A 57 year old man presents with epigastric pain radiating through to his back.  This has been associated with nausea and vomiting and he has had significant weight loss in the past few months.  He is known to be a heavy drinker and smoker.  On examination there is evidence of epigastric tenderness.  An upper GI endoscopy is performed and reveals oesophagitis.  What investigation would you organise next?,CT Abdomen,Abdominal ultrasound,Urea breath test,Colonoscopy,CA 19 9,A,In this history you should suspect a diagnosis of pancreatic cancer due to the weight loss and pain.  Although the upper GI endoscopy shows an oesophagitis this may not explain all the symptoms and you should have a low threshold for organising further imaging and a CT abdomen is the most appropriate to look at the pancreas.  A CA 19 9 could be performed but is not diagnostic on its own.
gastrointestinal system,208,A 65 year old gentleman has been referred due to jaundice. His LFTs show an increased bilirubin and ALP and a transaminitis. He has recently had a course of co amoxiclav and he has a past medical history of osteoarthritis for which he takes naproxen occasionally. He is not known to drink excessively and has no family history of liver disease. An ultrasound of the abdomen shows no abnormalities. What is the most likely cause of his jaundice and deranged LFTs?,Wilsons disease,Gallstones,Naproxen,Co amoxiclav,Hepatitis A,D,The most likely cause here is the recent course of co amoxiclav which has led to a cholestatic jaundice. Gallstones can lead to a cholestatic jaundice but there is normally history of pain and you would expect them to be seen on ultrasound. In Wilsons disease then neurological abnormalities would be present and it would present at a much earlier age.
gastrointestinal system,209,A 28 year old female presents with a history of diarrhoea for numerous years. She has been off work on several occasions due to this. On examination this is unremarkable and her bloods are normal except for a low potassium. She is brought into hospital for assessment and is asked to keep a stool chart which shows no evidence of diarrhoea. A colonoscopy is performed and this reveals brown discolouration of the mucosa and a biopsy reveals pigment laden macrophages. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Coeliac Disease,Laxative abuse,Microscopic colitis,Ulcerative Colitis,Irritable Bowel Syndrome,B,The colonoscopy finding of melanosis coli and the biopsy findings are in keeping with chronic laxative abuse.
gastrointestinal system,210,"A 40 year old gentleman had a previous duodenal ulcer. He had eradication therapy for H. Pylori. He has represented some six months later with similar symptoms. A repeat endoscopy is performed and shows multiple small ulcers. He is on long term omeprazole, has no past medical history and is a non smoker and takes very little alcohol. What investigation do you organise?",Repeat H pylori eradication and a further OGD in 3 months time,CT abdomen,Colonoscopy,Gastrin levels,Biopsy of ulcers,D,"A young patient with no risk factors for development of duodenal ulcers who has recurrent and multiple ulceration, gastrinoma should be suspected and serum gastrin levels measured. Zollinger Ellison syndrome/gastrinoma is a tumour in the pancreas or duodenum that secretes excessive amounts of gastrin which ultimately leads to ulceration in the duodenum. stomach and small intestine. It also can present with severe diarrhoea."
gastrointestinal system,211,Which of the following statements is true of autoimmune hepatitis?,It is associated with hypogammaglobulinaemia,It may be associated with keratoconjunctivitis sicca,It rarely interferes with menstruation except in later stages,It rarely presents before 20 years of age,It usually presents as an acute hepatitis,B,"It occurs frequently in young (10-20 years) and middle-aged women. Twenty-five percent present as acute hepatitis but usually the onset is insidious. Some may be asymptomatic for years and then are found to have signs of chronic liver disease. Amenorrhoea is common. It is associated with hyperglobulinaemia and other autoimmmune disease. Sixty percent are associated with HLA-B8, DR3 and Dw3. The sicca syndrome (xerostomia/dry eyes, keratoconjunctivitis sicca) may occur."
gastrointestinal system,212,"A 28-year-old man presents with change in bowel habit and a mass in his right iliac fossa. He states that his father, grandfather, and uncle have had bowel cancer previously and his sister breast cancer. He is subsequently diagnosed with bowel carcinoma, and is referred to genetics where he is diagnosed with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal carcinoma (HNPCC). How would he have been screened had he been diagnosed with HNPCC prior to developing bowel carcinoma?",Colonoscopy every five years,Colonoscopy every two years,Computed Topography (CT) scan every two years,CT scan every five years,Sigmoidoscopy every two years,B,"HNPCC (also known as Lynch syndrome) is an autosomal dominant disorder of DNA mismatch repair gene on chromosome 2 and 3. Affected individuals have a 50-80% lifetime risk of developing colorectal carcinoma. Individuals found to have HNPCC have colonoscopy every two years from the age of 25. If they have a relative who has been diagnosed with a bowel carcinoma prior to the age of 30, then colonoscopic screening might be recommended from an earlier age. Sigmoidoscopy is not adequate: the whole colon needs to be visualised. CT is not as sensitive as colonoscopy at diagnosing bowel malignancy, and the use of radiation in this context is not justified."
gastrointestinal system,213,A 61-year-old man has a 2 cm adenoma removed from his sigmoid colon. The biopsy results confirm an adenocarcinoma in situ with moderately differentiated dysplastic cells. The pathology report confirms total excision with clear resection margins. What is the most appropriate follow-up management for this patient?,Annual carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA),Chemotherapy,No follow up,Regular follow up with colonoscopy,Regular follow up with no colonoscopy,D,"The first thing to note is that the question is about planned management This patient has been picked up early and has had a tumour resected. His CEA would be normal and would not be expected to be elevated until the disease was quite established on the TNM scale. However, this patient's prognosis would be excellent but he is by definition someone with increased risk. Therefore he should continue to be reviewed with colonoscopy annually for at least two years."
gastrointestinal system,214,A 2 year old child with Down's Syndrome is brought to A+E with constipation. He has not moved his bowels for 2 weeks. He was noted to have delayed passage of meconium at birth. On examination there is evidence of abdominal distension. What is the most likely cause of his constipation?,Hirschsprung's Disease,Hypothyroidism,Functional,Intussusception,Cystic Fibrosis,A,"Hirschsprung's disease is more common in Down's syndrome with estimates of it affecting approximately 2%. Although constipation in general is common in Down's syndrome, which may be due to poor GI motility, the delayed passage of meconium after birth is a feature of Hirschsprung's disease rather than the other causes. It can present in older infants as chronic constipation with abdominal distension. Intussusception is associated with pain and classically a red currant jelly stool. There is no other features of hypothyroidism."
gastrointestinal system,215,"A 68-year-old man with a past medical history of myocardial infarction and hyperparathyroidism is brought into the emergency department. He is complaining of severe abdominal pain that came on suddenly. The pain is radiating to the left side of his back. His initial observations are: blood pressure of 106/70 mmHg, pulse of 108/min, saturations of 84% on air. You go to see him in the trolley bay area. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute mesenteric ischaemia,Acute pancreatitis,Perforated diverticular disease,Renal colic,Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,E,"The diagnosis to think of first is a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. This should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of possible renal colic. In this case the nature of the pain (sudden onset, radiating to the back), hypotension, and previous history of vascular disease mean that a ruptured aortic aneurysm is the most likely diagnosis."
gastrointestinal system,216,"A 71-year-old woman comes to the clinic for advice. Over the course of the past year or two, she has had increasing problems with regurgitation of rotten food, has lost weight and acquired a chronic cough. According to her partner, she has problems with halitosis which have not improved on multiple visits to the dentist. On examination her BP is 145/82 mmHg, pulse is 70 and regular and her BMI is 27. She has a neck mass which appears to gurgle when she swallows. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 132 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 7.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 161 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 95 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Achalasia,Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD),Oesophageal carcinoma,Pharyngeal pouch,Plummer-Vinson's disease,D,"The history of regurgitation of rotten food, coupled with chronic cough and a gurgling mass on examination fits best with a pharyngeal pouch. Aspiration of food from the pouch may lead in some cases to pneumonia. Management involves either diverticulectomy for larger lesions or endoscopic diverticulotomy (Dohlman's procedure) for smaller pouches. Whilst GORD is a possible alternative diagnosis, a pouch would not be found on examination. Achalasia is usually associated with progressive dysphagia to both liquids and solids, oesophageal carcinoma with progressive dysphagia first to solids then liquids. Again, external examination is typically normal.  Plummer-Vinson's disease is associated with progressive dysphagia due to oesophageal webs and is associated with chronic iron deficiency. A neck mass would not be typical. Oesophageal carcinoma often presents with systemic malaise as well as progressive dysphagia. The patient may appear cachetic, and there may be palpable nodes in the neck (if the carcinoma is proximal), but a gurgling mass would be less typical. If left untreated for a couple of years, you would expect the presence of metastatic disease and absolute dysphagia."
gastrointestinal system,217,"A 54-year-old man comes to the gastroenterology clinic for follow up of his ulcerative colitis. Over the past few months, he has suffered problems with increasing lethargy, and most recently has been off his food and has begun to suffer from intense itching. On examination, his BP is 145/82 mmHg and pulse 78. He has mildly jaundiced sclerae, and some scratch marks, predominantly on his arms. The rest of the physical examination was unremarkable. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (135-177)   White cells 7.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 189 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 95 μmol/L (79-118)   Albumin 35 g/L (35-50)   Alanine aminotransferase 85 U/L (5-40)   Alkaline phosphatase 395 U/L (39-117)   pANCA Positive    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune hepatitis,Churg-Strauss syndrome,Pancreatic carcinoma,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,E,"This man's history of lethargy and itching, together with a blood picture consistent with obstructive liver disease is typical of the condition. In total, between 75 and 90% of patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are thought to have co-existent inflammatory bowel disease, although only around 4% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease develop the condition. There is often an increase in IgM; and pANCA, aCL antibodies, and ANA are present in up to 84%, 66%, and 53% of patients, respectively. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), the gold standard investigation, demonstrates multiple intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct strictures and dilatations, although the non-invasive magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is often performed initially. PSC is chronically progressive with median time to liver failure put at around 12 years. Patients are additionally at increased risk of developing cholangiocarcinoma."
gastrointestinal system,218,A patient who is pregnant is suffering from severe nausea and vomiting.  She is dehydrated and is found to have deranged LFTs.  What is the most likely cause of her deranged LFTs?,HELLP syndrome,Acute fatty liver of pregnancy,Viral hepatitis,Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,Hyperemesis gravidarum,E,Patients with hyperemesis gravidarum present with severe nausea and vomiting and dehydration.  In up to half of cases there may be deranged LFTs.
gastrointestinal system,219,A 68 year old male presents with severe colicky abdominal pain.  Surprisingly there is only minimal generalised tenderness and no evidence of guarding.  He gives a history of weight loss and pain after eating for the last 6 months. He has previously had a myocardial infarction.  His bloods reveal raised inflammatory markers and a metabolic acidosis.  What might you see on abdominal Xray which would be more specific of the diagnosis?,Free air in the biliary tract,Faecal loading,Thumb printing,Free air under the diaphragm,Distended small bowel loops,C,"This history is indicative of acute on chronic mesenteric ischaemia.  This often presents with severe pain with surprisingly little to find on examination in the early stages.  The history of postprandial angina is typical of chronic mesenteric ischaemia.   Due to his history of an MI then he us likely to be an arteriopath and thus thrombus formation leading to ischaemia.  AS well as atherosclerosis and thrombus formation, there may be emboli such as AF or other causes include hypotension, coagulopathic states, infection and certain drugs such as cocaine. Raised inflammatory markers and metabolic acidosis is typical.  AXR is useful in the first place to to exclude other causes and may show thumbprinting (focally oedematous bowel wall) in late disease but most often now a CT of the abdomen is performed and may show bowel wall and mesenteric oedema, pneumatosis intestinalis and thumbprinting.    The gold standard was p[previously angiography however CT angiography is now more commonly used.  Multidetector CT with IV contrast is thought to be very useful for the diagnosis of superior mesenteric artery occlusion. Treatment options include medical management with papaverine (relieves vasospasm) and thrombolytics and surgical management such as angioplasty, embolectomy and bowel resection."
gastrointestinal system,220,"A 50 year old farm worker presents with a one year history of feeling generally unwell with arthralgia, fever, cough and chest pain. He has also notice that he has intermittent diarrhoea. On examination you find evidence of finger clubbing and a purpuric rash. In the abdomen you find hepatomegaly and a pansystolic murmur is heard of auscultation of the heart. Bloods reveal deranged LFTs and a high ESR and CRP. What investigation would you order to make the definitive diagnosis?",Echo,Blood cultures,CT CAP,Serology testing for coxiella,CXR,D,"The most likely diagnosis here is chronic Q fever caused by coxiella burnetii. A major hint is the fact that this patient is a farm worker and this is often contracted from cattle, sheep, goats and other farm animals. In the acute phase it can lead to flu like systems and an atypical pneumonia as there is evidence of a dry cough. There is often also GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. This infection can also lead to a hepatitis with hepatomegaly. It can also lead to a vasculitis and lead to myocarditis or pericarditis. Coxiella can also lead to an endocarditis but typically the cultures are negative and this should raise suspicion of coxiella. The other diagnosis you would be considering here are coeliac and Whipples but neither is associated with an endocarditis."
gastrointestinal system,221,A 48-year-old woman is admitted to emergency department with a productive cough and moderate fever. She has often central chest pain and regurgitation of undigested food most times but doesn’t suffer from acid reflux. These symptoms have been present for the last 3.5 months which affects both food and drink. A CXR shows an air-fluid level behind a normal sized heart. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pharyngeal pouch,Hiatus hernia,Bulbar palsy,Achalasia,TB,D,Points in favour of achalasia: Points in favour: Aspiration pneumonia due to retained food and fluid in oesophagus. In achalasia usually there is no acid reflux. Dysphagia for both food and drink. Air-fluid level behind heart. This is not hiatus hernia because i) In hiatus hernia usually you will get associated GORD ii) Also in hiatus hernia there may be nausea or vomiting. This is not pharyngeal pouch as there is no halitosis
gastrointestinal system,222,A 66-year-old male presents with painful swallowing. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Nesseria meningitides,Cryptococcus neoformans,Candida albicans,Isospora belli,Mycobacterium avium,C,Oropharyngeal and/or esophageal candidiasis
gastrointestinal system,223,"On liver biopsy, what would you expect to find in viral hepatitis?",Depleted interlobular ducts and granulomas,Hyalin globules,"Fatty change, centrilobular inflammation, Mallorys hyalin","Acidophil bodies, portal tract inflammation and cholestasis",Liver cell rosettes and plasma cells,D,"I*n viral hepatitis there is typically apoptotic necrosis producing acidophils, portal inflammation and cholestasis. Fatty change, centrilobular inflammation and mallorys hyalin is typical of alcohol liver disease.  Hyalin globules are normally seen in alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency whilst rosettes and plasma cells are observed in autoimmune hepatitis.  Primary biliary cirrhosis  leads to depleted interlobular ducts and granulomas."
gastrointestinal system,224,"A 42-year-old man with a history of ulcerative colitis (UC) comes to the gastroenterology clinic. He currently takes mesalazine and has quiescent disease. He has had three episodes of severe disease, the last one some two years ago. On examination he looks well, his BP is 115/72 mmHg, his pulse is 75 and regular, and his BMI is 23. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (135-177)   White cells 7.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 189 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 95 μmol/L (79-118)   Albumin 40 g/L (35-50)   Alanine aminotransferase 35 U/L (5-40)    He asks questions about his UC and risk of colonic malignancy with respect to his UC. Which of the following features would give you most cause for concern?",Disease confined to the rectum only,Disease duration of six years,Disease throughout the colon,No signs of primary sclerosing cholangitis,Three episodes of severe disease flare ups,C,"Of these factors, pancolitis would give most cause for concern with respect to risk of colonic malignancy. The relative risk for colonic carcinoma versus the general population is 14.8 for pancolitis, versus 1.7 for distal disease only. Other features of concern in patients with UC include:  primary sclerosing cholangitis presence of dysplastic lesions within the colon, and prolonged disease (8-10 years after diagnosis or more).  High-grade dysplasia or carcinoma necessitates colectomy, while many also recommend colectomy in patients with low-grade dysplasia."
gastrointestinal system,225,Acute pancreatitis carries a worse prognosis when it is associated with which of the following?,Aged under 55 years,Biliary calculi aetiology,Negative blood cultures,Normocalcaemia,Peri-pancreatic fluid on CT,E,"If a patient has an modified Imrie score of 3 or greater, then they are considered to have severe acute pancreatitis (which carries a mortality rate of 30% or more). The Imrie/Glasgow score allots 1 point for each of the following:    PaO2 less than60 mmHg   Albumin less than32 g/L   Calcium less than2 mmol/L   WBC greater than15 ×10^9/L   AST/ALT greater than200 IU/L   LDH greater than600 IU/L   Glucose greater than10 mmol/L   Urea greater than16 mmol/L   Age greater than55    A CT scan of the abdomen should be performed on day 6-10 following the onset of symptoms; findings which carry a worse prognosis are peri-pancreatic fluid or evidence of haemorrhage or necrosis. Positive blood cultures are significant, as they may represent infected pancreatic necrosis (patient mortality more than 50%). There appears to be no difference in outcome depending on the aetiology, however alcoholics appear to have more attacks of acute pancreatitis."
gastrointestinal system,226,A 34 year old has presented with recurrent heart burn. An upper GI endoscopy is performed and reveals a Barretts Oesophagus with mild dysplastic change occurring at the gastrocardiac junction. What is the next stage in the management?,Lifestyle advice,PPI introduction and repeat endoscopy,Oesophagectomy,Fundoplication,Gastrectomy,B,"Although this patient has Barretts oesophagus with dysplastic changes, in about 20 percent of patients there is findings of dysplastic changes at the gastrocardiac junction. As this is mild then the recommended management is acid suppression and repeat endoscopy. This would obviously be reconsidered if there was any suspicion of neoplasia."
gastrointestinal system,227,A 34-year-old woman is referred to the gastroenterology clinic. The GP referral letter states the patient has persistent lethargy and blood results have demonstrated iron deficiency anaemia. Which of the following statements regarding iron deficiency anaemia is correct?,Endomysial antibody serology to investigate for coeliac disease should always be requested in addition to duodenal biopsies,Low serum iron with a low total iron-binding capacity confirms iron deficiency,Microcytosis may be absent where there is combined iron and folate deficiency,The presence of Howell-Jolly bodies on blood film would go against coeliac disease,Thrombocytosis indicates chronic blood loss,C,"Iron-deficiency typically results in a microcytosis, but this can be absent when the is concurrent folate deficiency (which typically results in a macrocytosis). Coeliac disease is the cause of iron-deficiency in 2-3% of cases, and needs to be excluded. The gold-standard for diagnosis are distal duodenal (D2) biopsies. Endomysial antibody serology can be useful to confirm the subtotal villous atrophy is not due to another cause, or as a screening test prior to endoscopy. Antibody titres can also help to determine whether or not a patient is adhering to a gluten-free diet. However, it is not true to say that serology should ALWAYS be requested with biopsies. Low serum iron (less than10 pmol/L) with a high total iron-binding capacity (greater than70 pmol/L) confirms iron deficiency. Howell-Jolly bodies on blood film indicate hyposplenism and are consistent with a diagnosis of coeliac disease. Thrombocytosis may occur in acute haemorrhage but is also found in a number of other situations such as inflammatory conditions. "
gastrointestinal system,228,A 32-year-old female who is known to have Crohn's disease presents with increased frequency of micturition. She is demonstrated to have sterile pyuria. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Colo-vesical fistula,Recto-vesical fistula,Ileo-vesical fistula,ileo-ureteric fistula,Vesico-vaginal fistula,C,In Crohn's disease the most common origin of a fistula to the urinary tract is the ileum:  ileum - 64% colon - 22% rectum - 8%.  The most common urinary tract connection is the bladder:  bladder - 90% ureter - 5% urethra - 2% urachus - 3%.
gastrointestinal system,229,"A 50 year old female with known alcohol related liver disease is noted by her husband to be confused and disorientated. She has been recently commenced on furosemide and spironolactone for recurrent ascites.  Over the last few days she has complained of increased urinary frequency and dysuria.  On examination there was evidence of ascites, which were not tense, and asterixis.  Bloods revealed acute renal failure and deranged LFTs.  What is the most likely cause of her confusion?",Sepsis,UTI,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Acute renal failure,Hepatic encephalopathy,E,The most likely cause of her confusion is hepatic encephalopathy precipitated by renal failure secondary to diuretic use and sepsis secondary to a UTI is likely to have contributed.  It is important to exclude SBP.  In this patient case it is important to treat the ARF and infection and hopefully the encephaolpathy will resolve.
gastrointestinal system,230,"A 58-year-old man complains of tiredness, fever, weight loss, arthralgia and diarrhoea. Jejunal biopsy reveals flattened mucosa containing periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive macrophages. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Coeliac disease,Parasitic infection,Tropical sprue,Tuberculosis,Whipple's disease,E,"Whipple's disease is rare and most commonly affects middle-aged males. It can affect any organ but is dominated by involvement of small bowel, causing malabsorption. The organism (Tropheryma whippelii) can be identified both between and within abnormal macrophages which stain magenta with PAS. Treatment is with prolonged antibiotics, for example, parenteral penicillin and streptomycin for two weeks, followed by one year of doxycycline."
gastrointestinal system,231,"In ulcerative colitis, which of the following carries the greatest risk of developing colorectal cancer?",Relapsing and remitting disease,Proctitis,Pancolitis,Onset in adulthood,Poor compliance,C,"The risk of colorectal cancer in ulcerative colitis is greatest in pancolitis, onset in childhood, unremitting disease and in those who have had the disease for over ten years."
gastrointestinal system,232,Which of the following regarding Helicobacter pylori is true?,A urea breath test is more reliable than a urease test,Infection may elevate serum amylase,It is a Gram positive spiral flagellated organism,It is associated with oesophageal adenocarcinoma,It is the cause of ≥60% of gastric ulceration,E,"A urease test (from a biopsy) has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of over 99%. A urea breath test has a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 90%. Helicobacter pylori is Gram negative. Infection results in a chronic gastritis which, if it involves the body of the stomach, reduces acid secretion resulting in an increased gastrin synthesis. Serum amylase is not affected. Although gastric cancer is rare, Helicobacter pylori is an associated risk factor in 75%. It is not associated with oesophaeal cancer. Sixty per cent of gastric and 95% of duodenal ulcers are related to Helicobacter pylori. Also, mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas result from active infection and 80% regress after successful eradication of the organism."
gastrointestinal system,233,"With regards to cancer of the oesophagus in the UK, which one of the following is true?",Chest pain is a late symptom,Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common histology,Is associated with Crohn's disease,The commonest site is the lower third of the oesophagus,When occurring at the gastro-oesophageal level is equally likely to be an adenocarcinoma as a squamous carcinoma,D,"The commonest site of oesophageal carcinoma is the lower third of the oesophagus, at ~45-55% (increasing in incidence), followed by the middle third, at ~25-30%, then the upper third, with ~15%. Some tumours overlap these artificial divisions. Adenocarcinoma accounts for 65% of oesophageal cancers in the UK, but squamous cell still remains the most common form worldwide. Adenocarcinoma is the most common form at the gastro-oesophageal level. Chest pain is the presenting symptom in 20% (invasion/achalasia) and it is associated with Barrett's and coeliac disease."
gastrointestinal system,234,A 28-year-old woman was admitted with severe upper abdominal pain. Upper GI endoscopy revealed an active duodenal ulcer. Rapid urease test from the ulcer biopsy specimen was positive. She was started on oral triple-drug therapy for H. pylori infection. What is the best test to follow her up to confirm eradication of H. pylori?,Blood serology,Clinical symptoms,Repeat endoscopy and biopsy,Stool antigen test,Urea breath test,E,"Eradication of H. pylori is tested using a C-13 urea breath test.  The NICE guidelines of 2004, amended 2014 clearly state that the C-13 Urea breath test is the preferred method for testing eradication. Stool antigen test has not been validated yet. Blood serology is a good test for detecting infection but it is not validated at follow-up because the antibodies may remain positive for a long time after eradication. Clinical symptoms are not a good guide to determine eradication. Repeat endoscopy can determine healing of the ulcer, but it is an invasive procedure and not always feasible. "
gastrointestinal system,235,Which one of the following pathogens is uncommonly isolated from intra-abdominal pus?,Actinomyces,Clostridia,Escherichia coli,Enterococci,Klebsiella spp.,A,"The commonest aerobic bacteria in descending order are:  Escherichia coli Enterococci Proteus, and Klebsiella spp.  The commonest anaerobic bacteria in descending order are:  Bacteroides Clostridia. and Peptostreptococci.  Commonly found in breast abscesses are:  Actinomyces, and Bacillus anaerobes."
gastrointestinal system,236,A 65-year-old woman had an excision of colonic tumor 3 years ago. Now she is losing weight and feels lethargic. Examination: pale but no abdominal findings. What is the most appropriate investigation?,CA 125,CA 153,CA 199,CEA,AFP,D,CA 125 = ovarian cancer; CA 153 = cancer breast; CA 199 = pancreatic cancer; CEA = colorectal carcinoma; AFP = hepatocellular carcinoma
gastrointestinal system,237,An alcoholic 56-year-old man had ascitic fluid analysis done which was found to be yellow color. What is the most appropriate cause?,Alcoholic hepatitis,Decompensated cirrhosis,TB peritonitis,Pyogenic peritonitis,Neoplasm,B,"If the patient experiences serious problems described below his disease has progressed from compensated cirrhosis to decompensated cirrhosis: 1.	Bleeding varices (internal bleeding) 2.	Ascites (fluid in the belly) 3.	Encephalopathy (confusion) 4.	Jaundice (yellowing of eyes and skin)"
gastrointestinal system,238,Which one of the following is used for the treatment of pseudomembranous colitis secondary to Clostridium difficle infection?,Cefotaxime,Clindamycin,Co-amoxiclav,Gentamicin,Metronidazole,E,Antibiotic-associated colitis is caused by colonisation of the colon by Clostridium difficle following antibiotic therapy. It is a particular hazard with broad spectrum antibiotics. Oral vancomycin or metronidazole are the antibiotics of choice however more modern alternatives such as fidaxomicin are now available and microbiology advice is generally indicated.
gastrointestinal system,239,A 58-year-old female with type 2 diabetes is admitted with diarrhoea and vomiting. She has noticed small amounts of blood in her stools. The vomiting had commenced one day after a meal of chicken and chips. The patient's type 2 diabetes is treated with diet alone. Stool cultures taken by the GP reveal Campylobacter jejuni. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy?,Amoxicillin,Cefaclor,IV fluids,Metronidazole,Trimethoprim,C,"Campylobacter is a leading cause of diarrhoeal illness, often caused by ingestion of undercooked meat harbouring the pathogen. It is also a major cause of traveller's diarrhoea. The use of antibiotic therapy for the management of Campylobacter infection in adults is controversial. Antibiotic of choice in this infection is erythromycin, although ciprofloxacin and tetracycline may also be appropriate. However, appropriate fluid replacement and anti-emetics are initially indicated; most units advocate no antibiotic treatment."
gastrointestinal system,240,"A frail, 81-year-old man was admitted with a stroke. He had eight days of being nil by mouth so nasogastric feeding is commenced. Following the commencement of nasogastric feeding, which biochemical abnormality is most likely to cause drowsiness?",Hyperglycaemia,Hypermagnesaemia,Hypernatraemia,Hypocalcaemia,Hypophosphataemia,E,"The presentation suggests hypophosphataemia associated with refeeding syndrome. He has had a period of starvation and then feeding has been commenced.  This is well described in elderly, frail subjects who may have prior poor nutrition in addition to any period of oral starvation. Other electrolyte abnormalities are also described in association with NG feeds, for example, hypernatraemia, but with this briefest of histories and the eight days, hypophosphataemia is the most likely."
gastrointestinal system,241,"A 35-year-old woman was referred to the gastroenterology clinic with rectal bleeding. She underwent a colonoscopy which showed dark brown pigmentation of the entire colon, along with a small polyp in descending colon. Also, internal piles were found. Further questioning revealed that the patient had a history of chronic constipation for which she was taking some form of herbal medicine for a long time. Which of the following histopathological picture may be found in colonic biopsy of this patient?",Fungal hyphae in colon,Increased melanocytes in colonic epithelium,Macrophage infiltration of colonic mucosa lamina propria with lipofuscin pigment inside the macrophages,Malignant changes of colonic epithelium,Malignant melanoma changes of colonic epithelium,C,"This patient, with history of laxative abuse, shows diffuse pigmentation of colon. This is suggestive of melanosis coli, a phenotypic consequence of chronic abuse of anthraquinone laxatives. Chronic use of anthraquinone laxatives cause injury to the colonic epithelium, with generation of lipofuscin pigment. This pigment is subsequently engulfed by the macrophages to give rise to the histological picture. Generally, these changes are reversible and stopping the laxative may lead to disappearance of the phenotypic changes. The modern laxatives such as liquid paraffin and polyethylene glycol do not cause these changes. However, alternative andquot;medicineandquot; drugs contain ingredients like cascara which contain anthraquinones. Colonic fungal infection does cause this type of colonoscopic appearance. In melanosis coli, there is not increased melanocytes but rather, increased abnormal lipofuscin pigment. Malignant changes of the colon are usually seen as localized growth or polypoidal mass. Diffuse pigmentation is not found. Melanoma of the colon is very rare. Usually, it presents as a localized mass, which may or may not be pigmented. The rectal bleeding in this patient has no relation to melanosis coli. Melanosis coli is an asymptomatic condition and diagnosed incidentally on colonoscopy. The bleeding in this case is caused by either the piles or the polyp.  "
gastrointestinal system,242,With which of the following is Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) associated?,Columnar metaplasia,Endoscopic evidence of oesophageal ulceration in the majority of cases,Increased gastric emptying,Increased oesophageal clearance of refluxed acid,Relief of symptoms after eradication of Helicobacter pylori,A,"The development of columnar metaplasia is described as Barrett's oesophagus. This is defined as endoscopically visible columnar epithelium of any length, which shows intestinal metaplasia on histological examination. It is a pre-malignant condition. A secondary cause of GORD is impaired gastric emptying. There is no evidence of a reduction in GORD after elimination of Helicobacter pylori. "
gastrointestinal system,243,"A 76-year-old man presents with dysphagia and 1.5 kg unintentional weight loss for three months. He reports some andquot;funny feelings in his throatandquot; when swallowing food. His wife also reports that he has become increasingly short of breath. He reports no changes in his bowel habit and denies melaena or fresh rectal bleeding. An examination reveals a palpable lump in the throat which has an audible gurgle when the patient swallows, but there are no other abnormalities. Bloods show the following:    Sodium 140 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L)   Potassium 4 mmol/L (3.5-4.9 mmol/L)   Creatinine 90 μmol/L (60-110 μmol/L)   Urea 5. 4 mmol/L (2.5-7.5 mmol/L)   Adjusted calcium 2.3 mmol/L (2.2-2.6 mmol/L)   ALT 37 U/L (7-55 U/L)   ALP 60 U/L (45-115 U/L)   Bilirubin 14 μmol/L (less than22 μmol/L)   Albumin 45 g/L (35-55 g/L)   Haemoglobin 140 g/L (115-140 g/L)   White cell count 10 ×10^9/L (4-11 ×10^9/L)   Platelets 200×10^9/L (150-400 ×10^9/L)   Neutrophils 2.7×10^9/L (1.8-8 ×10^9/L)   CRP less than5 mg/L (less than5 mg/L)     Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Achalasia,Barrett's oesophagus,Follicular thyroid carcinoma,Oesophageal carcinoma,Pharyngeal pouch,E,"A pharyngeal pouch is a herniation between the thyropharyngeus and cricopharyngeus muscles (Killian's dehiscence, in the inferior constrictor of the pharynx), resulting in a diverticulum where food and other debris can collect. The aetiology is not fully understood, but malfunction of the upper oesophageal sphincter probably contributes. Patients typically present with dysphagia, regurgitation of food, aspiration, chronic cough, and weight loss. Clinical signs are often lacking, but there may be a palpable lump in the neck which gurgles on palpation. Food decaying in the pouch can also result in halitosis. Endoscopy should only be performed with caution, as it can result in perforation of the pouch and therefore barium swallow is preferred as an initial investigation. Management depends on the size of the lesion. Larger lesions can still be treated with diverticulectomy, but minimally invasive techniques and cricopharyngeal myotomy and the mainstay of treatment of smaller lesions.  Oesophageal carcinoma would definitely be high on the list of differential diagnoses in this patient, but you might expect more progressive dysphagia (initially to solids, then progressing to liquids) and more marked weight loss. It would be unusual to have a palpable neck lump in oesophageal carcinoma (unless it is an involved lymph node). Barrett's oesophagus is essentially an asymptomatic condition diagnosed on endoscopy, although you would expect the patient to have symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. Follicular thyroid carcinoma might present in an enlarged thyroid resulting in some dysphagia, and the thyroid may be palpable but this would be an unusual presentation and the lump would not gurgle on swallowing. Achalasia typically presents with dysphagia to solids, regurgitation and chest pain but a palpable lump in the neck would not be expected.  "
gastrointestinal system,244,"A 52-year-old man returns for repeat endoscopy. He was last scoped some six months earlier after persistent indigestion, upon which both duodenal ulceration and Helicobacter was found. He underwent eradication therapy but his indigestion has worsened, particularly over the past four to six weeks. On examination his BP is 132/72 mmHg, his pulse is 70 and regular. He has mild epigastric tenderness. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 109 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 7.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 240 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 143 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (79-118)   Serum gastrin 850 pg/ml (less than200)    Repeat endoscopy: extensive duodenal ulceration. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",Calcium stimulation test,CT abdomen,Omeprazole 40 mg,Partial gastrectomy,Secretin stimulation test,E,"This patient's gastrin is moderately elevated, levels above 1,000 are strongly indicative of a gastrinoma. Unless there is concomitant high-dose PPI therapy, at a gastrin level of 850 this patient should be subject to stimulation testing. Secretin is the first choice, and a rise of greater than 200 is a pointer towards a gastrinoma as the underlying diagnosis. It would be sensible to perform the secretin first, prior to attempting pancreatic imaging. He should not be committed to high dose PPI therapy until gastrinoma has been ruled out."
gastrointestinal system,245,"A 43-year-old wine buyer for a supermarket presents to the gastroenterology clinic for review. He has suffered from diarrhoea over the past 6-9 months, which is slowly worsening, and he tells you that this is difficult to flush away and often sticks to the toilet bowl. He also suffers from dull epigastric pain which comes on 1-2 hours after a meal, and has lost 4 kg in weight over the past three months. One previous episode of acute pancreatitis 18 months ago is noted. On examination his BP is 115/82 mmHg, pulse is 80 bpm and regular. He is mildly tender in the epigastrium, and is thin with a BMI of 19 kg/m^2. Investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (135-180)   Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) 104 fL (76-100)   White cell count (WCC) 7.9 ×10^9/L (6-10)   Platelet count 112 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 134 mmol/L (135-145)   K 3.4 mmol/L (3.5-5.5)   Creatinine 89 µmol/L (60-110)   Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 112 U/L (0-35)   Alkaline phosphatase 185 IU/L (40-120)   Albumin 25 g/L (30-50)   Amylase 205 U/L (30-110)    Which of the following is the best way to confirm exocrine pancreatic insufficiency?",Abdominal CT,Faecal elastase,Faecal fat,Hydrogen breath test,MRCP,B,"Confirmation of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency requires a functional test, and faecal elastase is the best option. One gram of stool is required for analysis, and the level of elastase-1 can indicate:  less than100 mcg/g - severe pancreatic insufficiency 100-200 mcg/g - moderate insufficiency greater than200 mcg/g - normal.  The advantage of this versus other options is that the test can be performed on a single spot faeces sample. Abdominal CT and MRCP may be useful in demonstrating pancreatic anatomy, including areas of calcification and fibrosis consistent with chronic pancreatitis; they are not a functional measure. Faecal fat is generally avoided now because of difficulties for the patient in collecting all their faeces. Hydrogen breath testing is used in the diagnosis of bacterial overgrowth syndrome."
gastrointestinal system,246,"A 49-year-old female presents with a six-month history of pruritus. Examintation reveals jaundice, xanthelasma, scratch marks, vitiligo and 3 cm hepatomegaly. She was afebrile. Liver function tests reveal raised bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyl transferase and mildly elevated alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be found in this woman?",Constipation,Haemolysis,Lymphadenopathy,Vitamin A deficiency,Vitamin B complex deficiency,D,"The most likely diagnosis is primary biliary cirrhosis as evidenced by  pruritus hypercholesterolaemia jaundice raised ALP, and γ-GT.  Malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, K) is common."
gastrointestinal system,247,What is the best way to monitor a patient's nutritional status?,Weight,BMI,Clinically,Albumin,Serum levels of elements,C,There is no real best way however it is advisable to monitor clinically based on how the patient looks and feels.  BMI and weight is good for monitoring change and serum levels of elements and albumin have numerous factors which can affect them such as albumin is an acute phase response and thus may be falsely elevated.
gastrointestinal system,248,What proportion of patients diagnosed with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) are positive for anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA)?,25%,45%,65%,85%,95%,E,"Anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are the serologic hallmark of primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and are positive in approximately 95% of patients. Occasionally AMA are found in patients with no other features suggestive of PBC. Many of these patients will eventually develop features of PBC. Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) can be seen in up to 70% of patients with PBC. PBC is a progressive autoimmune liver disease characterised by a triad of:  chronic cholestasis circulating AMA, and characteristic liver biopsy findings of non-suppurative destructive cholangitis and interlobular bile duct destruction.  It is thought to be related to environmental exposure in genetically vulnerable individuals and typically occurs in middle-aged females. The main clinical features include:  fatigue pruritis jaundice xanthomata osteoporosis, and dyslipidaemia.  Ursodeoxycholic acid is the mainstay of treatment which works partly by reducing the concentration and injury from toxic bile acids. Liver transplantation is the definitive therapy for advanced disease with a ten year survival rate of approximately 70% post-transplantation. "
gastrointestinal system,249,Which one of the following suggests a diagnosis of Hirschsprung's disease?,A contrast study showing dilatation of the aganglionic bowel segment,Early presentation with vomiting,Neonatal large bowel obstruction,Presentation after one year of age,Red current jelly stools,C,Hirschsprung's disease is a common cause of neonatal large bowel obstruction. It results from failure of migration of ganglion cells to the affected segment of bowel. This always involves the distal colon but the proximal extent of the involvement is variable and in rare cases may involve the whole of the large bowel. Eighty percent of cases present in the neonatal period. Contrast studies show the affected segment to be tonically contracted. Rectal irrigation or an emergency colostomy may be required before a definitive 'pull-through' procedure. Patients present typically with constipation and present late with vomiting and obstruction.
gastrointestinal system,250,Which of the following is correct with regard to H-type tracheo-oesophageal fistula?,H-types account for 20% of tracheo-oesophageal fistulae,H-types have a recognised associated with hemivertebrae,H-types have an associated mortality of 1-2%,In the majority of patients there are no residual oesophageal motility problems,Tracheo-oesophageal fistula results from posterior deviation of septum dividing the primitive foregut at 12 weeks fetal age,B,"H-type fistulae are an uncommon variant of the tracheo-oesophageal fistulae and have an associated mortality of 10-20%. Disruption to division of the embryonic trachea and oesophagus occurs in the fourth week of fetal life. Vertebral, renal, tracheal, anal and limb abnormalities are associated. The condition has a high mortality rate. Persistent abnormalities in the distal oesophagus at the site of repair occurs (for example, strictures). Dilatation may be required."
gastrointestinal system,251,"In infantile pyloric stenosis, which of the following is correct?",Babies usually present with hyperchloraemic metabolic alkalosis,Projectile bilious vomiting is characteristic,Ramstedt's pyloroplasty is performed,The pyloric canal is lengthened,The pylorus is palpable in 50% of cases,D,"Infantile pyloric stenosis presents with milky, projectile vomiting. The muscular hypertrophy causes increase in diameter and length of the pylorus which is palpbale in 85% of cases. Vomiting results in hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis, sometimes with hypokalaemia. When this has been corrected with fluid resuscitation Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy (not pyloroplasty) is performed. The muscle is split and no sutures are required, but the mucosa is not breached (that is, it should not be breached - you can check by putting saline in the pyloromyotomy and blowing air through the NG tube). Pyloroplasty is a completely different procedure, designed to widen the pylorus."
gastrointestinal system,252,A 26-year-old man presented with abdomen distension and pain. His stools have been mucoid and sometimes blood stained. What is the most appropriate investigation?,Stool C&S,Gastroscopy,IgG tissue transglutaminase,Barium meal,Jejunal biopsy,D,Probable diagnosis is Crohn’s disease
gastrointestinal system,253,"A 43-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with an eight hour history of severe right upper quadrant pain and vomiting. She says that the pain exacerbates on breathing and is radiating to her right scapula. On examination, she is pale. Her pulse rate is 104/min and temperature is 38.8°C. Abdominal examination reveals a tender mass over the right hypochondrium. She says that she used to get this type of pain following a fatty meal, although not this severe. Serum amylase is not elevated. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute appendicitis,Acute cholecystitis,Acute pancreatitis,Cirrhosis of the liver,Gall stones,B,"Acute cholecystitis is the acute inflammation of the gall bladder. Gallstones are the commonest cause for inflammation. They may obstruct the common bile duct which in turn prevents the flow of the bile. This leads to accumulation of bile and inflammation leading to an acutely inflamed gall bladder. Build up of bile within the gall bladder also increases the pressure within the gall bladder, thus increasing the chance of perforation. Other risk factors for acute cholecystitis include:  Alcohol abuse, and Tumours of the gall bladder.  Acute cholecystitis is more common in females over 40 years of age who have a high BMI; the incidence increases with fertility. The frequent signs and symptoms of acute cholecystitis include:  Severe right hypochondrial pain which is exacerbated by breathing Nausea and vomiting, and Pyrexia.  A tender, inflamed gall bladder is frequently, but not always, palpable. . Pain associated with gall stones is typically seen after a fatty meal and the mere presence of gall stones do not present with signs of inflammation (for example, pyrexia). The other differential diagnoses for acute cholecystitis include:  Acute pancreatitis Peptic ulcer Appendicitis, and Pleurisy.  Since the clinical diagnosis of acute cholecystitis may be difficult, an ultrasound scan or a cholescintigraphy may be necessary to clinch the diagnosis. The immediate management of acute cholecystitis involves rest, intravenous antibiotics, and analgesia. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is probably the preferred managment in early acute cholecystitis in expert hands. Cholecystitis was previously managed with antibiotics and interval cholecystectomy but it is now recognised that acute cholecystectomy is safe when performed by a suitably qualified surgeon and if interval cholecystectomy is planned many patients represent in the interim with ongoing symptoms."
gastrointestinal system,254,"A 55 year old gentleman presents to his GP with intermittent abdominal pain and diarrhoea which is sometimes difficult to flush away. He has also had a cough, fever and has noticed aches and pains in his joints. A biopsy of the duodenum reveals periodic acid Schiff stain positive macrophages with intracellular clumps. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Whipples disease,Coeliac disease,Inflammatory Bowel Disease,Carcinoid Syndrome,Bacterial Overgrowth,A,"Whipples disease leads to the above symptoms and can also lead to pericarditis, lymphadenopathy, neurological abnormalities, pleural effusion and hyperpigmentation. The key to this diagnosis is the evidence on biopsy of PAS positive macrophages with intracellular clumps of T. Whipplei. This is characteristic of Whipples disease and excludes the other diagnoses."
gastrointestinal system,255,A 55-year-old woman presents with lethargy and diarrhoea together with joint pains and intermittent fever. These symptoms have developed over the last six months during which time she has lost 6 kg in weight. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy is noted. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Bacillary dysentery,Campylobacter infection,Coeliac disease,Giardiasis,Whipple's disease ,E,"Whipple's disease is caused by Tropheryma whippelii and symptoms include:  chronic diarrhoea arthralgia weight loss diarrhoea joint symptoms (up to 80% cases)  CNS maneifestation in 10-40% (therefore may not be present)  Diagnosis is by microscopy of jejunal biopsy specimen which shows macrophages with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain positive granules. Treatment is by IV penicillin or cephalosporin, followed by a year of cotimoxazole (sulphamethaxazole is the active component; trimethoprim does not work). Bacillarary dysentry and Campylobacter jejuni infection are characterised by bloody diarrhoea and are not chronic. Coeliac disease and giardiasis have no lymph involvement. "
gastrointestinal system,256,"A 29-year-old man presents with anaemia, bleeding tendency, diarrhoea, and abdominal pain. Examination reveals a palpable mass in the right lower quadrant and anal skin tags. What is the most likely underlying condition?",Chronic pancreatitis,Coeliac disease,Crohn's disease,Intestinal lymphoma,Ulcerative colitis,C,"Crohn's disease commonly presents with diarrhoea, abdominal pain and weight loss. It can affect the whole gastrointestinal tract, the most common being ileocolitis. Anaemia is usually due to blood loss and less commonly B12/folate malabsorption. An abdominal mass is often palpable in the presence of small bowel disease which can lead to Vitamin K malabsorption. Anal tags, fissures, perianal fistulae and abscesses are associated with Crohn's disease and not ulcerative colitis."
gastrointestinal system,257,How does lactulose work?,Increased faecal pH,Reduced gastric motility,Bulk forming laxative,Increased motility,Softens faecal matter,E,Lactulose is an osmotic laxative and therefore acts to soften faecal matter. It has a very important role in ALD as it leads to the reduction of ammonia. This is due to the fact as it is broken down by bacteria in the lower part of the intestines which leads to the environment becoming acidic which neutralises the ammonia and reduces the amount absorbed. This leads to reduction of encephalopathy.
gastrointestinal system,258,"A patient presents with a number of episodes of rectal bleeding over the last week. He describes a cup full of fresh red blood present in the toilet following defecation, but denies any pain on passing stool. He has no other past medical history of note nor does he take any medications. He does however report a history of his father having a andquot;bowel problemandquot;. Bloods show:    Sodium 140 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L)   Potassium 4 mmol/L (3.5-4.9 mmol/L)   Creatinine 99 mmol/L (60-110 mmol/L)   Urea 11 μmol/L (2.5-7.5 μmol/L)   Adjusted calcium 2.3 mmol/L (2.2-2.6 mmol/L)   ALT 37 U/L (7-55 U/L)   ALP 87 U/L (45-115 U/L)   Bilirubin 11 μmol/L (less than22 μmol/L)   Albumin 39 mmol/L (35-55 mmol/L)   Haemoglobin 79 g/L (115-140 g/L)   White cell count 6.3 ×10^9/L (4-11 ×10^9/L)   Platelets 156 ×10^9/L (150-400 ×10^9/L)   Neut 3.0 ×10^9/L (1.8-8 ×10^9/L)     On clinical examination you notice a number of small red areas on the patients lips, about 1 mm in diameter which disappear on pressure before refilling. Which of the following is the inheritance pattern of the underlying condition?",Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Mitochondrial,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,A,"The patient here likely has hereditary haemorrhagic telangectasia. This is an autosomal dominant form of angiodysplasia associated with lip telangiectasia. It is present in 5 per 100,000 patients and often presents with lower or upper GI bleeds, due to telangiectasia within the gastrointestinal tract. Patients can also have arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) affecting the viscera, such as the lungs, brain, or spine. Gastrointestinal bleeding is usually managed with iron supplements or blood transfusion, and AVMs may require surgery.  HHT is not inherited in any of the other mechanisms given in the question."
gastrointestinal system,259,Which of the following drugs is a P450 hepatic enzyme inducer?,Ciprofloxacin,Erythromycin,Ketoconazole,Phenobarbitone,Sodium valproate,D,The correct answer is phenobarbitone. The remainder of the listed options are all inhibitors of cytochrome P450. 
gastrointestinal system,260,A 12-year-old has recurrent abdominal pain which is worse when he is hungry. The pain is relieved by food or meal. He is tender in the epigastrium. Test has revealed Helicobacter pylori infection. What is the single most appropriate management?,Proton pump inhibitor,Enema and laxative,Aspirin,Gluten free diet,Metoclopramide,A,As patient has H. pylori infection the most appropriate management is triple therapy. But as it is not in the given options Proton pump inhibitor is the next answer
gastrointestinal system,261,A 60 year old gentleman presents to his GP with tiredness and increased shortness of breath.  Bloods reveal a microcytic hypochromic anaemia and he is subsequently found to have iron deficiency anaemia.  There is no evidence of any GI symptoms.  What investigation s most appropriate to organise in this case?,Recheck bloods in three months time after iron supplementation,Colonoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,CT Chest Abdomen and Pelvis,Flexible sigmoidoscopy,B,A colonoscopy should be performed in this case as lower GI pathology is more likely to be malignant than upper GI pathology which is often oesophagitis or other benign conditions are found.  Upper GI malignancy also has a lower incidence than lower GI malignancy.  Obviously if there is any upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia or dysphagia then an upper GI endoscopy should be performed in the first instance.
gastrointestinal system,262,A 64-year-old lady presents with symptoms suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome. Which of the following would represent a 'red flag' indicator and prompt further investigation?,A recent change to more frequent stools in the last two months,Abdominal pain,Bloating,Change in bowel habit present for at least the last two years,Weight gain,A,"The 'red flag' indicators are listed in the NICE guidelines as:  unintentional and unintended weight loss rectal bleeding a family history of bowel or ovarian cancer, and a change in bowel habit to looser and/or more frequent stools persisting for more than six weeks in a person aged over 60 years.  Also on clinical examination, the other 'red flag' indicators are:  anaemia abdominal mass rectal mass, and inflammatory markers for inflammatory bowel disease.  "
gastrointestinal system,263,A 48 year old woman presents with dysphagia. This is both to liquids and solids. She has also associated retrosternal pain and she does sometimes regurgitate food. She has not had any weight loss. There is no past medical history and she is well otherwise. There is nil of note on examination and bloods are normal. A barium swallow is organised which shows a dilated oesophagus and birds beak appearance at the distal end of the oesophagus. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hiatus hernia,GORD,Chagas disease,Achalasia,Oesophageal cancer,D,"The patient gives a history of dysphagia to both liquids and solids which is suggestive of dysmotility disorder, AKA achalasia. This is supported by her otherwise well appearance and her associated features of retrosternal pain. The birds beak appearance at the distal end on a barium swallow is also very indicative of achalasia."
gastrointestinal system,264,Conditions predisposing to carcinoma of the oesophagus include which of the following?,Aspirin ingestion,Blood group A,Crohn's disease,Excess alcohol consumption,Partial gastrectomy,D,"Excess alcohol intake is mainly associated with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the oesophagus. Other factors in the development of SCC of the oesophagus are:  smoking human papilloma virus Plummer-Vinson syndrome, and tylosis (autosomal dominant with a risk of 70%).  Cancer of the stomach is associated with:  blood group A pernicious anaemia partial gastrectomy atrophic gastritis.  "
gastrointestinal system,265,"A 28-year-old woman presents with three months of diarrhoea and rectal bleeding. She has had similar episodes in the past, and has diagnosed herself with lactose intolerance. She currently reports 10-12 watery bloody stools per day and is becoming distressed by the effect it is having on her quality of life. Examination reveals a diffuse tender abdomen. Bloods show the following:    Sodium 136 mmol/L (135-145 mmol/L)   Potassium 4.6 mmol/L (3.5-4.9 mmol/L)   Creatinine 119 μmol/L (60-110 μmol/L)   Urea 8.1 mmol/L (2.5-7.5 mmol/L)   Adjusted calcium 2.1 mmol/L (2.2-2.6 mmol/L)   ALT 44 U/L (7-55 U/L)   ALP 66 U/L (45-115 U/L)   Bili 13 μmol/L (less than22 μmol/L)   Albumin 32 g/L (35-55 g/L)   Haemoglobin 104 g/L (115-140 g/L)   White cell count 5 ×10^9/L (4-11 ×10^9/L)   MCV 86 fl (80-96 fl)   Platelets 170 ×10^9/L (150-400 ×10^9/L)   Neutrophils 5.3 ×10^9/L (1.8-8 ×10^9/L)   CRP 30 g/L (less than5 g/L)    A biopsy from colonoscopy reveals crypt abscess formation and lymphocytic infiltration of the lamina propria. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Coeliac disease,Colorectal carcinoma,Crohn's disease,Ulcerative colitis,Whipple's disease,D,"A history of bloody diarrhoea in a young female with anaemia, mildly raised CRP, and the above findings on colonoscopy biopsy are diagnostic of ulcerative colitis. Treatment during an acute flare is dietary support, oral and/or rectal steroids followed by immunosuppression and surgery if medical treatments are unsuccessful. Crohn's disease is classically associated with strictures, transmural inflammation, fistulae, ulcers, and cobblestoning on endoscopy. Coeliac disease does not present with bloody diarrhoea. A histological diagnosis is usually only possible if the duodenum is biopsied during colonoscopy. Whipple's disease is caused by Tropheryma whippelii, a gram-positive bacterium, which results in malabsorption, arthritis, and endocarditis.  Colorectal carcinomas are often characteristic in their appearance and so suspected during endoscopy, and the biopsy would be diagnostic of malignancy. It is thankfully rare in this age group."
gastrointestinal system,266,"A 75 year old gentleman with acid reflux symptoms, bloating and weight loss. He has had previous surgery for a perforated duodenal ulcer many years ago. He has a medical history of hypertension and is currently on ramipril. On examination there is nil of note except a mid line laparotomy scar. Bloods are performed and reveal a macrocytic anaemia. What is the next most appropriate investigation?",Upper GI endoscopy,Oesophageal manometry and pH studies,Colonoscopy,Hydrogen breath test,CT CAP,D,This gentleman has a previous history of upper GI surgery and thus bacterial overgrowth should be suspected. The Hydrogen breath test is a non invasive test to confirm the diagnosis. At this gentlemans age however there should always be a low threshold for upper GI endoscopy.
gastrointestinal system,267,A 73-year-old woman has had abdominal discomfort and distension for two days. She has not opened her bowels for a week or passed flatus for two days. She appears slow and has a temperature of 35.5°C. Her pulse is 56 BPM. Her abdomen is not tender. An abdominal X ray shows dilated loops of small and large bowel. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Colitis,Colonic cancer,Diverticulitis,Pseudo-obstruction,Small bowel obstruction,D,"This woman appears to have pseudo-obstruction related to hypothyroidism as suggested by the slowness and hypothermia. Other causes of pseudo-obstruction include:  Hypokalaemia Diabetes Uraemia, and Hypocalcaemia, etc.  "
gastrointestinal system,268,"An elderly male patient with prior history of hematemesis is having history of long term use of aspirin and other drugs, now presents with severe epigastric pain, dysphagia and vomiting. He was connected to vital monitors which were not reassuring. What is the management?",Oral antacids,IV PPI,Oral PPI,Endoscopy,Analgesia,D,Long term use of an nsaid predisposes to peptic ulcers. This may cause considerable bleeding leading to shock
gastrointestinal system,269,"A 50 year old female presents with fatigue and pruritus.  Bloods reveal a raised ALP and high normal bilirubin.  Antimitochondrial antibodies are found and raised IgM.  Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment should be commenced?",D penicillamine,Azathioprine,Ursodeoxycholic acid,Methotrexate,Rifampicin,C,"Primary biliary cirrhosis leads to destruction of interlobular bile ducts due to chronic granulomatous inflammation causing progressive cholestasis, cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  It is thought to be autoimmune.  PBC is often found incidentally however common presenting features are fatigue and pruritus. Signs can occur later in the disease such as xanthelasma, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hyperpigmentation and jaundice.  Early in the disease ALP is often the only abnormal blood findings although later bilirubin and transaminases can become elevated.  It can be associated with other diseases such as thyroid disease, coeliac and systemic sclerosis.  The raised IgM and finding of antimitochondrial autoantibodies is the key to making the diagnosis and antimitochondrial antibodies have a high specificity. Ursodeoxycholic acid at high doses is thought to slow progression.  Colestyramine is useful for pruritus as this can be severe.  If this fails then rifampicin or naltrexone may be considered.  Liver transplantation is used in end stage liver disease or severe intractable pruritus."
gastrointestinal system,270,Which of the following statements regarding the genetic and immunological basis of coeliac disease is correct?,50% of patients are HLA-DQ 2 or HLA-DQ 8 positive,Alpha-gliadin specific CD8 cells can be identified in the intestinal wall of untreated patients with coeliac disease,Cow's milk proteins may precipitate an immune-related enteropathy indistinguishable from coeliac disease,Tissue transglutaminase generates the antigenic epitopes present in alpha-gliadin,TNF-alpha plays a critical role in the inflammatory response in the intestinal wall of patients with untreated coeliac disease,D,"The prevalence of coeliac disease is 1% in western societies and is thus one of the commonest immune-mediated diseases. It arises as a result of genetic predisposition (at least 95% of patients are HLA-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive) and also from the specific immune response to the alpha-gliadin component of gluten. Cow's milk can produce an immunologically mediated enteropathy but the condition is rare and transient. The action of tissue transglutaminase on alpha-gliadin generates epitopes to CD4+ T-lymphocytes, which provoke an inflammatory response in the intestinal wall. In untreated individuals, alpha-gliadin specific CD4+ T cells can be found producing interferon-gamma in the intestinal wall."
gastrointestinal system,271,A 32-year-old man presented with slow progressive dysphagia. There is past history of retro-sternal discomfort and he has been treated with prokinetics and H2 blockers. What is the probably diagnosis?,Foreign body,Plummer vinson syndrome,Pharyngeal puch,Peptic stricture,Esophageal Ca,D,Progressive dysphagia (to mostly solid) is suggestive of peptic stricture which is supported here by the use of prokinetic drugs and H2 blockers which are used for reflux oesophagitis
gastrointestinal system,272,Which of the following may cause acute pancreatitis?,Aspirin therapy,Azathioprine therapy,Hypocalcaemia,Hypolipidaemia,Parvovirus B18,B,"Precipitants of acute pancreatitis include:  Gallstones Alcohol Hypercalcaemia Pancreatic neoplasms, and Type V hyperlipidaemia (hypertriglyceridaemia).  Other causes include infections such as mumps, coxsackie, EBV or the hepatits viruses. Hypocalcaemia may be caused by pancreatitis."
gastrointestinal system,273,Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia is seen in which of the following?,Biliary atresia,Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas,Cholecystitis,Gilbert's disease,Polycystic liver disease,D,"Unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia occurs when the liver is unable to cope with the breakdown of red blood cells as occurs in sickle cell, hereditary spherocytosis and Gilbert's. Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas results in conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia as is biliary atresia"
gastrointestinal system,274,Which of the following gut hormones stimulates acid secretion in the stomach?,Cholecystokinin (CCK),Gastrin,Polypeptide P,Secretin,Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),B,"Gastrin is secreted from the antrum of the stomach when stimulated by parasympathetic nerves and the presence of amino acids in the stomach. It stimulates gastric motility, growth and acid secretion, and intestinal motility. The secretion of gastrin is inhibited by acid in stomach and somatostatin."
gastrointestinal system,275,"A 92 year old gentleman presents to his GP with abdominal discomfort, bloating, flatulence and intermittent diarrhoea. He has previously had a partial gastrectomy due to gastric carcinoma. There is nil of note on examination and his bloods results show a macrocytic anaemia. What investigation would you next organise?",CT abdomen,Hydrogen breath test,Upper GI endoscopy,Colonoscopy,Serum B12,B,The history of a previous partial gastrectomy and the symptoms are indicative of bacterial overgrown syndrome. A hydrogen breath test will confirm the diagnosis. If there is any concern of a recurrence of a gastric carcinoma then an upper GI endoscopy should be performed. Due to the partial gastrectomy this patient is likely to be low in intrinsic factor and thus leading to a macrocytic anaemia as seen here.
gastrointestinal system,276,A 54-year-old man attends his GP with recurrent problems with acid reflux despite changes to his diet and reduction of his alcohol intake. An endosocopy is performed which reveals Barrett's oesophagus with biopsy inconclusive for signs of dysplasia. Which of the following is the optimum management for this patient in regards to symptom control and disease monitoring?,Endoscopy only every year,Long term PPI and endoscopy every year,Long term PPI and endoscopy every five years,Trial of PPI and endoscopy every five years,Trial of PPI only,B,"Barrett's oesophagus is found in 10-20% of patients with chronic acid reflux. It is a premalignant change to the oesophageal mucosa and increases patients risk of developing adenocarcinoma by 50-100 times. Symptomatic relief is with long term proton pump inhibitors, which help to reduce further dysplastic changes. Endoscopy and biopsy annually is the optimum surveillance method for detection of early transformation to oesophageal adenocarcinoma."
gastrointestinal system,277,"A 36 year old female, who has recently been in Safari in Africa, presents with diarrhoea and lower abdominal pain which has been on going for several weeks. Her stools were initially loose however the diarrhoea is now bloody and there is evidence of mucous. A stool sample contains trophozoites and leucocytes. What is the likely organism leading to these symptoms?",Adenovirus,Entamoeba histolytica,Salmonella enterica,Giardia Lamblia,C. Difficile,B,"The key to the answer to this question is the evidence of trophozoites and leucocytes in the stools. Entamoeba histolytica is a parasite and is an enteroinvasive organism and can thus lead to bloody diarrhoea. It is normally asymptomatic passage of cysts in stools however it can present as above, initially with abdominal pain and diarrhoea which becomes bloody. It can present more severely with evidence of tenderness and distension or present similarly to diverticulitis with haemorrhage There may be evidence of trophozoites and leucocytes in stools and examining 3 stools improves the sensitivity. The diagnosis should be confirmed with stool culture, antigen testing or PCR. Diloxanide furoate is the treatment of choice."
gastrointestinal system,278,Which of the following is true of Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis?,A survival rate of over 50% is expected at one year,Gentamicin is the treatment of choice,Is characteristically caused by anaerobic bacteria,Is diagnosed by culture and examination of ascitic fluid,Is due to intestinal perforation,D,"SBP is a frequent complication of the ascites of cirrhosis. It is diagnosed by ascitic fluid examination which reveals a PMN count of greater than250/ml. SBP has poor prognostic significance with a one-year survival after a diagnosis of between 30-50%. It is, as the name suggests a spontaneous event that is not a consequence of intestinal perforation. It is speculated that the infective organism may leak into the ascitic fluid via the blood or from intestinal overgrowth. Organisms should be cultured by directly collecting into blood culture bottles. It is typically caused by aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Hence, antibiotics such as co-amoxiclav, tazoscin, or ciprofloxacin are typically used as first line treatment. E. coli and Klebsiella should be considered aerobic organisms. They are more precisely defined as facultative anaerobes, that is to say, they reproduce best in aerobic conditions but can also reproduce in anaerobic conditions. Obligate anaerobes (e.g. Clostridia) are killed by the presence of oxygen as opposed to aerotolerant anaerobes (e.g. Lactobacillus) which have exclusively fermentative (anaerobic) metabolism but are not sensitive to the presence of oxygen."
gastrointestinal system,279,A 19-year-old male presents with a single stab wound to the right side of his abdomen following a fight in a nightclub. On examination he has a pulse of 120 bpm and a blood pressure of 80/40 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals generalised tenderness. There are no other obvious injuries. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this patient?,Abdominal ultrasound scan,Abdominal CT scan,Diagnostic peritoneal lavage,Laparoscopy,Laparotomy,E,"Rapid detection and early intervention can dramatically affect the outcome of patients with intra-abdominal injuries. A haemodynamically unstable patient with obvious intra-abdominal injury requires immediate laparotomy to control the source of bleeding. Fluid resuscitation (preferably with blood) should be initiated, although this should not be allowed to delay the operative intervention. Haemodynamically stable patients with abdominal injury require investigation as the ability to detect intra-abdominal injury clinically is limited. In the trauma situation, chest radiographs are usually performed in the supine position and have a limited value in detecting free intra-abdominal air. Other special diagnostic studies include diagnostic peritoneal lavage (a cannula is introduced via the umbilicus, saline introduced and allowed to drain to identify blood in the peritoneal cavity), however this modality has now been superseded by the improvements in ultrasound and CT. Both ultrasound and CT have high sensitivities in picking up intra-abdominal bleeding but may miss bowel injuries. Laparoscopy is useful if ultrasound and CT are equivocal but the patient fails to improve. If the patient becomes unstable a laparotomy is mandatory."
gastrointestinal system,280,You suspect a patient with Crohns disease nay have bile acid malabsorption.  What treatment might be useful?,Loperamide,Increased dose of preexisting treatment,Codeine,Infliximab,Colestyramine,E,"When there is severe involvement of the terminal ileum, this can lead to bile acid malabsorption and thus diarrhoea related to this. Colestyramine is the most useful drug to counteract this.  The other drugs are not useful for bile acid malabsorption."
gastrointestinal system,281,"A 57-year-old man with blood group A complains of symptoms of vomiting, tiredness, weight loss and palpitations. Exam: hepatomegaly, ascites, palpable left supraclavicular mass. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Gastric carcinoma,Colorectal carcinoma,Peptic ulcer disease,Atrophic gastritic,Krukenburg tumor,A,"i) blood group A is associated with gastric cancer ii) vomiting, tiredness, weight loss are general features of gastric cancer iii) palpitation from anemia of cancer iv) hepatomegaly (metastasis) and ascites are late features of gastric cancer.v) palpable left supraclavicular mass- is Vershow’sgland, has long been regarded as strongly indicative of gastric cancer"
gastrointestinal system,282,"A 77-year-old female presented with progressive difficulty in swallowing both solid and liquid food for the last two years. This time, when seen in the clinic, she was grossly emaciated and complained that she had not had any major meal for the last one week. She also had a nagging cough for the last two years. She had been investigated extensively for a cough with sputum for AFB, pulmonary function test and bronchoscopy, among other things, but all tests had turned out negative. On examination, there was no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. The only other clinical feature of note was a strikingly bad breath. The patient also remarked that her partner had complained to her about this foul odour but even after countless visits to the dentist and changing her toothpaste, she had been unable to tackle the problem. What is the likely diagnosis?",Chronic sinusitis,Esophageal carcinoma,Gastro-colic fistula,Lung abscess,Pharyngeal pouch,E,"Pharyngeal pouch (or diverticula) usually presents in the elderly. They can easily be diagnosed by barium studies. Pharyngeal pouch is a diverticulum in the posterior pharyngeal wall which can give rise to the above symptoms. The opening of the pouch acts as an alternative passage for swallowed food. As the food items get trapped inside, the pouch enlarges and gives rise to both mechanical obstruction of the esophagus and also the bad breath.  Chronic sinusitis can present with a bad breath, but dysphagia is unlikely. Esophageal carcinoma is a strong differential diagnosis in this case. The age of the patient is also suggestive of malignancy, but a malignancy usually progresses rapidly and it is unlikely to remain undiagnosed for two years. Gastro-colic fistula is another important cause of bad breath. But dysphagia is unusual. Rather, there would be nausea and vomiting. Weight loss is also a feature of this condition. In lung abscess, the chronic cough and bad breath are possible. Usually, lung abscess presents as an acute event with fever, cough, hemoptysis etc. However, sometimes, in tubercular and fungal abscess, such chronic presentation is possible. Weight loss can also occur in chronic infection anywhere. But dysphagia is unlikely. "
gastrointestinal system,283,"A 30-year-old Caucasian male presents with a six-month history of weight loss, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. On examination you note finger clubbing. Which of the following diagnoses is least likely?",Coeliac disease,Crohn's disease,Ileo-caecal TB ,Ulcerative colitis,Whipple's disease,C,Ileo-caecal TB is the only condition mentioned not associated with clubbing and would be very rare in a young Caucasian in the United Kingdom.
gastrointestinal system,284,You are asked to review the blood results of an 18-year-old woman who is known to have anorexia nervosa. She is under close review by the dietician who has asked you to ensure electrolytes are checked daily. Which of the following is a feature of the potentially life-threatening complication this lady is at risk of developing?,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypermagnesaemia,Hyperphosphataemia,Hypophosphataemia,E,"There are potentially fatal complications which can result from refeeding patients who have had periods of starvation, including those with anorexia nervosa. Hypophosphataemia is a key feature of refeeding syndrome. Refeeding syndrome is defined as the clinical complications which arise as a consequence of fluid and electrolyte shifts during the nutritional support of malnourished patients. Refeeding syndrome comprises:  Hypophosphataemia Hypokalaemia Hypomagnesaemia Deficiencies in vitamins, for example, thiamine and trace minerals, and Fluid overload with oedema.  The fluid retention may contribute to cardiac failure."
gastrointestinal system,285,A 56-year-old male presents with persistent watery diarrhea. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Treponema pallidum,Nesseria meningitides,Cryptosporidium,Staph aureus,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,C,"Cryptosporidiosis mainly affects children. It can affect adults as well. It causes a self-limited diarrheal illness in otherwise healthy adults. However, it is also recognized as a cause of prolonged and persistent diarrhea which can result in malnutrition. Cryptosporidiosis can manifest as chronic severe diarrhea in persons with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)"
gastrointestinal system,286,"A 26-year-old woman is referred with intermittent diarrhoea, present for a couple of years. She states that her weight has been steady but describes watery motions up to six stools per day and has also noted abdominal discomfort with bloating. She has not been aware of any blood in the motions or melaena. She describes no other medical history and denies taking any medication. Investigations show:    Full blood count Normal   Urea and electrolytes Normal   Albumin 39 g/L (37-49)   Corrected calcium 2.2 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Alkaline phosphatase 94 U/L (45-105)   C-reactive protein 6 mg/L (less than10)   Prothrombin time 12 s (11.5-15.5)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Crohn's disease,Intestinal tuberculosis,Small bowel bacterial overgrowth,Laxative abuse,Microscopic colitis,D,"The normal albumin and C-reactive protein level count against a diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's or microscopic colitis) or an infection pathology such as intestinal tuberculosis. Whilst small bowel bacterial overgrowth does not typically produce a raised C-reactive protein level it is very unusual in patients without risk factors for the condition (previous bowel surgery, Crohn's disease, motility disorders such as scleroderma). This leaves laxative abuse as the most likely diagnosis. Laxative abuse, where not a function of chronic constipation, is usually closely linked to eating disorders (bulimia and anorexia) and as such is typically over-represented in young, female patients. Patients may well present to medical services and be referred on to secondary care with symptoms relating to overuse of laxative agents. They may well also deny abusing any medications on initial questioning."
gastrointestinal system,287,A 70-year-old woman presented with a history of pancreatitis and persistent diarrhoea. She also gave a history of osteoporosis and had had a deep vein thrombosis. Which one of the following drugs will become less effective after she starts taking cholestyramine to relieve intolerable itching?,Aspirin,Folic acid,Thiamine,Vitamin D,Warfarin,D,Cholestyramine is an anion exchange resin and will interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. Thus vitamin D absorption will be reduced making treatment with this drug less effective when given with cholestyramine. Cholestyramine may enhance or reduce the anticoagulant effect of warfarin (see BNF).
gastrointestinal system,288,Which of the following is true of Crohn's disease?,A concordance of 15% in monozygotic twins,Erythema marginatum,Increased association with a low fibre diet,More likely to have HLA B27,Premature puberty,C,"The concordance of Crohn's disease in monozygotic twins is 65%. There is also a 6-15% familial association. Erythema marginatum is seen in rheumatic fever. Erythema nodosum is seen in Crohn's disease. It is true that there is increased association with a low fibre diet and high refined sugar diet, though the links are unclear (high fibre low sugar diet over two years had no effect on disease). That there is a link with luminal factors is suggested from the observation that Crohn's colitis tends to heal when the colon is rendered non-functional by ileostomy and an elemental diet can be an effective treatment in active disease. Those with ankylosing spondylitis have HLA B27. In Crohn's disease there are weak links with ATG16L1 (chromosome 16), Nod2, IGRM an IL23R. There are also associations with variations on chromosomes 5 and 10. There is no point in remembering any of these as no major gene has yet been identified. Puberty may be delayed by malabsorption and reduced growth rate."
gastrointestinal system,289,A patient is referred to hepatology department for possible treatment of hepatitis B. He has stigmata of chronic liver disease. There is portal hypertension and ascites. His INR is 2.2 (less than1.4) and albumin 25 g/L (37-49). HBsAg and HBeAg positive. Hepatitis C screen is negative. What will you suggest for treatment?,Beta interferon,Entecavir,Lamivudine plus interferon,Ribavirin alone,Ribavirin plus interferon,B,"This patient has hepatitis B related decompensated liver disease. High viral load is associated with poorer prognosis for these patients, and therefore prompt treatment with antivirals can improve outlook. Entecavir or tenofovir are the most appropriate medications and can be used in combination. However, their use in this situation is not without risk and may precipitate a lactic acidosis so careful monitoring is required Interferon use is discouraged for patients with hepatic decompensation associated with hepatitis B, as it has been associated with life-threatening disease flares and infectious complications.  Lamivudine alone is safe in decompensated HBV infection however it is no longer the drug of choice in this setting as there is increasing concern with regard to lamivudine resistance. Additionally, entecavir and tenofovir give more rapid control of HBV DNA levels.  Ribavirin is used for hepatitis C infection. Its combination with interferon confers more success in treating HCV infection. "
gastrointestinal system,290,Which of the following is true regarding post-operative ileus?,Can occur following parasympathetic overactivity,Is characterised by increased bowel sounds,May occur after most abdominal operations,Of the small bowel usually resolves after gastric and colonic stasis has resolved,Resolution can be reliably predicted by the return of bowel sounds,C,"Intestinal atony occurs to some extent after most abdominal operations. However, even in the presence of this post-operative ileus, small bowel activity can continue despite gastric and colonic stasis. The aetiology is thought to include:  Intra-operative bowel manipulation Sympathetic overactivity Peritoneal irritation (for example, from blood), and Electrolyte imbalances, especially hypokalaemia.  The presence of increased bowel sounds and colicky abdominal pain suggest mechanical obstruction, which can follow an ileus. The ileus usually resolves within 48 hours, although the presence of bowel sounds is not a reliable indicator."
gastrointestinal system,291,A 79-year-old lady who is otherwise well recently started abdominal pain. She is afebrile and complains that she passed air bubbles during urination. A urethral catheter showed fecal leakage in the urinary bag. What is the likely pathology?,Diuretics,CD,Rectosigmoid tumor,Large bowel perforation,UC,B,"D/D is rectosigmoidaltumour. As there is no constitutional features of cancer like anorexia, weight loss, fever rectosigmoid tumour is unlikely. Crohn’s disease can occur at any age, but is most frequently diagnosed in people ages 15 - 35. About 10% of patients are children under age 18. So Crohn’s disease can occur in this age also and the feature like fistula is a common association of CD"
gastrointestinal system,292,"With respect to liver cirrhosis, which of the following statements is correct?","Endothelin causes dilatation of the sinusoids, thus decreasing portal hypertension","In end stage cirrhosis, liver transplantation is associated with 20% five- year survival",The final common pathway of hepatic fibrosis is mediated by the hepatic stellate cell,Transforming growth factor is a potent promoter of the fibrogenic response by hepatocytes,Tumour necrosis factor is an anti-inflammatory effector in fibrotic liver injury,C,"The hepatic stellate cells reside in the space of Disse and are central to the process of fibrosis within the liver. Tumour necrosis factor-α is a pro-inflammatory effector in fibrotic liver injury, through activation of the stellate cells. These cells then secrete the fibrillar collagen constituting the defining features of hepatic fibrosis. Interleukin-10 is thought to exert anti-inflammatory effects on the stellate cell. Endothelin is a vasoconstrictor in the hepatic sinusoids (similarly in the endothelium of the systemic circulation) and functions by causing contraction of the hepatic stellate cells thus increasing intrahepatic sinusoidal resistance and promoting portal hypertension. Nitric oxide antagonises the effects of endothelin in the liver. Five-year survival after liver transplantation is now 75%. "
gastrointestinal system,293,Which of the following would score 3 on the Child Pugh classification?,Encephalopathy grade I,PT of 2.0,Bilirubin of 50,Mild ascites,Albumin less than 28,E,"An albumin of less than 28, severe ascites, grade III or IV encephalopathy, bilirubin of greater than 50 and an INR of greater than 2.2 would score 3 points."
gastrointestinal system,294,A 28-year-old female presented with complains of difficulties in swallowing liquids only. She also suffers from recurrent chest infection in the past few months. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Foreign body,Plummer vinson syndrome,Achalasia cardia,Peptic stricture,Esophageal carcinoma,C,Dysphagia to both solid and liquid or mostly to liquid is common feature of achalasia. In early stages of achalasia there may occur aspiration due to regurgitation during lying down to sleep which may result in recurrent chest infection and cough
gastrointestinal system,295,Which is true of Hirschsprung's disease?,A barium enema confirms the diagnosis,Is associated with Down's syndrome,It is usually autosomal recessive inheritance if there is a family history,Long-segment Hirschsprung's disease is more common in boys,Only involves the colon,B,"Hirschsprung's disease is the most common cause of neonatal colon obstruction. About 80% are short segment disease (not involving the whole of the colon). Males are more commonly affected than females at a ratio of 5:1. Long segment Hirschsprung's disease (greater than40 cm) (20%) affects boys and girls equally. Around 9% of cases are associated with Down's syndrome. There is a familial element which is usually autosomal dominant inheritance. The condition may rarely extend into the small bowel. It results from the absence of ganglionic cells in part or the entire wall of the colon (myenteric plexus) resulting in the state of chronic contraction. Indications include:  Constipation Distension, and Bilious faeculent vomiting that typically presents in the newborn period.  There may be a delayed appearance of stool and children may present with loose motions as a result of overflow. Cases with very short segment Hirschsprung's disease may not become manifest until adolescence or even adulthood. Diagnosis may be suspected on barium enema by the appearance of a megacolon proximal to the aganglionic segment. Confirmation must be made by the demonstration of an aganglionic segment of bowel on a biopsy strip. Surgical resection of the aganglionic segment of bowel is required (pull-through operation)."
gastrointestinal system,296,"A 36-year-old alcoholic has an endoscopy some 16 hours after his admission with a variceal haemorrhage. This is his second admission in six months with an upper GI bleed and he has required a 4 unit blood transfusion. Endoscopy reveals a number of large oesophageal varices, including one with adherent clot. Which of the following is the therapy with the best evidence with respect to reducing the risk of a variceal bleed over the next few months?",High dose omeprazole,Propanolol,Sclerotherapy,Variceal banding,Vasopressin,D,"The answer is variceal banding. Banding is proven to eliminate varices with fewer procedures and complications than injection sclerotherapy. A recent trial has demonstrated that beta blockade and sclerotherapy are better than beta blockade alone in prophylaxis against bleeding. The vasopressin analogue, terlipressin is used to control bleeding acutely, along with somatostatin analogues."
gastrointestinal system,297,"A 53-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis was referred with iron deficiency anaemia. Endoscopy revealed several superficial antral erosions with small bowel biopsy showing mild villous blunting, apopotic bodies, occasional eosinophils and mild increase in chronic inflammatory cells. Colonoscopy was reported as normal. What is the most likely cause of these findings?",Coeliac disease,Crohn’s disease,Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy,Small bowel lymphoma,Whipple’s disease,C,"This salient features in this patient's case revolve around the fact that she has rheumatoid arthritis (hence the requirement for NSAIDs), the iron deficiency anaemia and the superficial ulceration on endoscopy with features indicative of inflammation due to the chronic NSAID use. Coeliac disease is associated with villous atrophy and lymphocyte infiltration. There is no suggestion on the biopsy of lymphocyte infiltration which argues against lymphoma or coeliac."
gastrointestinal system,298,A 43-year-old female presents with abdominal pain and watery diarrhoea. She is taking ibuprofen for joint pains and has been previously investigated for infertility. She was given a proton pump inhibitor by her GP for six weeks with no relief of her symptoms. Investigations:    Haemoglobin 122 g/L (115-165)   Calcium 2.86 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Albumin 42 g/L (37-49)   Phosphate 0.8 mmol/L (0.8-1.4)   CRP 10 mg/L (less than10)   Endoscopy Multiple small duodenal ulcers   H. pylori Negative    What is the likely diagnosis?,Crohn's disease,Cushing's syndrome,Multiple endocrine neoplasia,NSAID induced PUD,Small bowel lymphoma,C,"The CRP is not raised, making a diagnosis of Crohn's unlikely. The duodenal ulcers (DUs) have persisted despite a lengthy treatment with PPIs. Small bowel lymphoma is suggested by narrowing of the intestine lumen resulting in paraumbilical pain made worse by eating, with weight loss, vomiting and occasional intestinal obstruction. Small bowel lymphoma is diagnosed by contrast radiographs and intestinal biopsy. The most likely diagnosis here is MEN; likely MEN1a (Wermer's syndrome). Multiple DUs make a diagnosis of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome likely, due to gastrinomas. Hypergastrinaemia may be the cause of the diarrhoea. There is also hypercalcaemia as a result of the parathyroid hyperplasia indicative of this condition. There may not necessarily be a family history, sporadic cases make up 10% of new cases. The infertility would fit with a prolactinoma."
gastrointestinal system,299,"A 20 year old has been having bloody diarrhoea for the last 2 months. She is brought to A and E as she is very unwell, moving her bowels about 15 times a day even through the night and is having abdominal pain. On examination she is very tender generally in the abdomen and she is hypotensive and tachycardic. How would you next manage this patient?",IV steroids,Inflammatory markers,IV antibiotics,Flexible Sigmoidoscopy,Fluid resuscitation and AXR,E,This patient has toxic megacolon which is most likely secondary to undiagnosed ulcerative colitis given the 2 month history of bloody diarrhoea. This patient needs fluid resuscitation and an urgent AXR to asses for toxic megacolon and an urgent surgical review if this is found to be the case. Obviously IV steroids are key to the management of inflammatory bowel disease but the toxic megacolon must be treated first.
gastrointestinal system,300,"A 30-year-old man presents with acute, profuse, watery diarrhoea with some blood after returning from a holiday in Tanzania. He had been taking oral rehydration salts. Which one of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Ciprofloxacin ,Loperamide , Metronidazole,Prednisolone ,Vancomycin,A,The most likely cause of such traveller's diarrhoea is Escherichia coli and hence ciprofloxacin is recommended for first-line antibiotic therapy (when needed) before stool culture results are available. Metronidazole would be suitable for Giardia infection but its course is usually more insidious.
gastrointestinal system,301,Which of the following is a recognised cause of toxic megacolon?,Acute mesenteric ischaemia,Amoebic dysentery,Diverticulitis,Pancreatitis,Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis,B,"Toxic megacolon is mainly associated with severe ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease. It may occur with ischaemic colitis but usually where the ischaemia involves less than the full thickness of the bowel wall. This may result in ischaemic stricture after recovery if no surgery is required. Amoebic dysentery may progress to:  amoeboma fulminant colitis (made worse by loperamide) toxic megacolon, and colonic ulcers.  It may also lead to perforation. Other complications of amoebiasis include stricture formation, haemorrhage, and amoebic liver abscess. Toxic megacolon can also result from Clostridium difficile infection. Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by Clostridium difficile and associated with antibiotic use. Symptoms vary from mild diarrhoea to fulminating toxic megacolon. Salmonella is also a recognised cause, particularly in children. Salmonella enterocolitis produces colitis, acute appendicitis in the young and mesenteric thrombosis in the elderly. Pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis is associated with chronic bronchitis (multiple gas filled cysts in sub-mucosa of colon). It is mainly asymptomatic, but can cause abdominal pain, diarrhoea and rupture to produce pneumoperitoneum."
gastrointestinal system,302,A 42-year-old female who is obese comes with severe upper abdominal pain and right shoulder tip pain with a temperature of 37.8C. She has 5 children. What investigation should we do for diagnosis?,ERCP,LFT,Serum amylase,MRCP,US abdomen,E,"The diagnosis is cholecystitis. The diagnosis of cholecystitis is suggested by the history (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever) and physical examinations in addition to laboratory and ultrasonographic testing. Boas's sign which is pain in the area below the right scapula, can be a symptom of acute cholecystitis. Pnemonic for cholecystitis is 5 “f”. Fat, female, fair, forty, fertile = cholecystitis"
gastrointestinal system,303,A 60 year old gentleman with known alcohol excess presents with epigastric pain radiating to his back.  This has occurred several times.  He also describes steatorrhoea and weight loss.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute pancreatitis,Coeliac disease,Alcoholic liver disease,Chronic pancreatitis,Gastritis,D,This patients history is highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis given the features of malabsorption i.e. steatorrhoea and weight loss.  The epigastric pain radiating to the back is also indicative.  It is less likely to be just acute pancreatitis given the malabsorption symptoms however there may an acute on chronic element.  It can also lead to diabetes due to pancreatic insufficiency.
gastrointestinal system,304,A 17-year-old student returns from a backpacking trip to Nepal with a two-week history of offensive diarrhoea and weight loss. Which is the most likely infective organism?,Escherichia coli 0157,Giardia intestinalis (G.lamblia),Salmonella typhi,Shigella flexneri,Yersinia enterocolitica,B,"The history of diarrhoea over a couple of weeks makes giardiasis the most likely diagnosis here. Giardia lamblia is a protozoan which can cause traveller's diarrhoea. It is transmitted by cysts from faecally contaminated water or between people. The incubation period is three days to three weeks and the symptoms can persist for several weeks. Diarrhoea tends to be the presenting symptom and classically has a highly offensive smell. This is often followed by nausea, cramps, abdominal pain, and bloating. The diarrhoea can become persistent and lead to malabsorption and weight loss. Unlike other infective causes of chronic diarrhoea, Giardia readily affects immunocompetent hosts as well as the immunocompromised. Giardia is diagnosed by visualising cysts in stool or trophozoites in small bowel mucosal biopsy. It is treated with tinidazole (2 g single dose), or metronidazole (3-10 days). Metronidazole has been shown to cure over 90% of patients and is often better tolerated than tinidazole. Paromomycin can be used in pregnancy as there is no systemic absorption. Resistant infection can often be cured with a combination of metronidazole and quinacrine. Escherichia coli 0157 is a rare cause of infectious gastroenteritis. It usually causes bloody diarrhoea which lasts less than a week. It can be complicated by haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Shigella and Yersinia also usually cause dysentery. Salmonella typhi causes typhoid fever which typically presents as a systemic illness with intermittent diarrhoea. "
gastrointestinal system,305,Which of the following is correct regarding familial adenomatous polyposis?,Has an increased incidence of ampullary carcinoma,Is an autosomal recessive condition,Is associated with colonic carcinoma in 100% of individuals by age of 40 years,May be associated with peripheral nerve tumours,The gene is found on chromosome 21,A,"Familial adenomatous polyposis has an increased incidence of ampullary carcinoma, hence the need to follow up even after total colectomy. It is an autosomal dominant condition. It is associated in almost all, but not 100% of individuals with colonic carcinoma. It may also be associated with CN tumours. Gardner's syndrome is associated with soft tissue tumours. The gene is found on chromosome 5q 21-22d - Turcot's syndrome."
gastrointestinal system,306,"A 51-year-old man was brought to the Emergency Department for loose stools. He was dehydrated, weak, and in shock. He had previously been complaining of large stool volumes for a one month period. Stool colour was normal. There was no history of laxative abuse and no significant past medical history. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Carcinoid syndrome,Diabetic diarrhoea,Gastrinoma,Systemic mastocytosis,VIPoma,E,"VIPomas are endocrine tumours that secrete excessive amounts of VIP 32 which cause a distinct syndrome characterised by  large-volume watery diarrhoea hypokalaemia, and dehydration.  This syndrome is also called Verner-Morrison syndrome, pancreatic cholera, or WDHA syndrome (for Watery Diarrhoea, Hypokalaemia, and Achlorhydria) which some patients develop. The mean age of patients is 49 years; however, it can occur in children and when it does is usually caused by a ganglioneuroma or ganglioneuroblastoma. A stool volume of less than700 mL/d excludes the diagnosis of VIPoma."
gastrointestinal system,307,"A 33-year-old man was admitted to the hospital with acute bloody diarrhoea. He had had blood in stool occasionally over the last 6 months but he had not visited any doctor for it. This time, he presented with fever and tachycardia. After admission, an emergency colonoscopy showed inflamed mucosa with occasional bleeding spots. A biopsy was taken from the colonic mucosa which revealed inflammatory cellular infiltration only in the mucosa with aggregation of neutrophils in crypts. What is the first line of management in this patient?",Aminosalicylate enema,Intravenous corticosteroids,Oral aminosalicylates,Oral ASA plus oral steroids,Oral steroids,B,"This patient has ulcerative colitis (UC). There are typical clinical features and also, mucosal biopsy shows crypt abscesses. According to Truelove and Witts' criteria, this patient has severe UC. Thus, according to the NICE guidelines, intravenous corticosteroids are used to induce remission. Topical aminosalicylate is used in mild to moderate UC especially that limited to rectum or sigmoid colon. Oral ASA is also used in mild to moderate UC, according to the patient's preferences although it alone is less effective than topical preparation. In inflammatory exacerbations, high dose oral ASA induction may be used. Oral ASA plus oral steroids is used in acute exacerbation of mild to moderate UC or left sided UC. Oral steroids are usually add-on in step-2 therapy. It may be used as firstline if there is intolerance to oral ASA. Further reading: Ulcerative colitis: management: Clinical guideline [CG166]"

She also complained that recently, she had become constipated with one bowel movement every 3 to 5 days. Both of her brothers had died from colon cancer recently and she is afraid that andquot;it runs in the familyandquot;. What is the next line of investigation to screen for colon carcinoma in this lady?",Stool for occult blood test (OBT),Colonoscopy,CT enterography,CECT abdomen,Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level,B,"In suspected colonic carcinoma, colonoscopy is the best test for diagnosis, according to NICE guidelines. Stool for OBT can be positive in colorectal cancer, but it is not specific. Any colitis, piles or upper GI pathology can also cause positive result in stool. CT enterography or colonography is a new test which has shown promise in detecting early colorectal cancer, but its sensitivity has not been tested in any adequately powered study yet. Also, CT colonography cannot be used to take tissue sample. CECT abdomen is used to stage colon Ca. But it is not a good screening test. CEA is not a good screening test. It can be used to detect recurrence after therapy.  "
gastrointestinal system,309,A 52-year-old male is admitted with vomiting and acute epigastric abdominal pain which radiates through to his back. Investigations confirm severe acute pancreatitis. Which of the following figures most accurately reflect the mortality associated with severe acute pancreatitis?,Less than 5%,Approximately 10%,Approximately 20%,Approximately 30%,Approximately 40%,C,"Mortality in acute pancreatitis varies according to age, co-morbidities and severity and is scored through the Ranson scoring system. However, average mortality has remained pretty much unchanged over the last two decades with severe disease, and is approximately 20%."
gastrointestinal system,310,"A young woman complains of diarrhea, abdominal cramps and mouth ulcers. Abdominal X-ray shows distended transverse colon with globet cell depletion on rectal biopsy. What is the most probable diagnosis?",CD (Crohn’s disease),UC (Ulcerative colitis),Bowel Ca,Bowel obstruction,IBS (Irritable bowel syndrome),B,In UC there is goblet cell depletion and less mucous production in contrast with CD where there may be goblet cell hyperplasia and mucous secretion is not reduced. Please note aphthous ulcer can develop in both CD and UC
gastrointestinal system,311,"A 45-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with a 48 hour history of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, dyspnoea, non-productive cough and high temperature. She says that the pain is radiating to her right shoulder tip. She had undergone repair of a perforated duodenal ulcer three weeks ago. On examination, her temperature is 39.3°C and she is acutely tender over the right hypochondric region. Chest x ray reveals a right sided pleural effusion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute cholangitis,Acute pancreatitis,Crohn's disease,Pyonephrosis,Subphrenic abscess,E,"Subphrenic abscesses usually arise as a result of direct contamination after surgery especially of the biliary tract, duodenum or stomach, or a perforated viscus. The other causes include infections or trauma to the liver and gall bladder. The subphrenic space is in direct contact with the para-colic gutter, thereby allowing peritoneal contamination such as bile, blood or bowel contents to spread. Clinical features include:  pyrexia (sometimes swinging) anorexia loss of appetite, and loss of weight.  Chills and rigors may be seen in some patients. Diaphragmatic irritation may affect the right lung, which may result in chest pain, dyspnoea and non-productive cough. Basal atelectasis, pneumonia and pleural effusion are also recognised complications which cause percussion dullness and decreased breath sounds on the affected side. An ultrasound scan or CT scan is the investigation of choice to diagnose subphrenic abscess, and, if an abscess is identified, ultrasound guided percutaneous drainage catheter may be placed at the same time. However, if the abscess is diagnosed early (but no air fluid level) it may then be treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a short duration."

She is found to be hypertensive  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Limited cutaneous scleroderma,CREST syndrome,Ehlers Danlos,Systemic lupus erythematous,Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma,E,"Diffuse cutaneous scleroderma is the most likely diagnosis.  It begins with swelling and stiffness of the fingers and then sclerosis.  Raynaud's can often occur just before the onset, whereas in limited scleroderma it is often ongoing for many years.. Heartburn, reflux or dysphagia are very common.  It can involve the kidneys and thus lead to hypertension.  It can lead to pulmonary fibrosis and hypertension."

Which of the following concerning lactulose is true?,Absorbed from the gut,Causes hypermagnesaemia,Contraindicated in diabetes mellitus,Inhibits proliferation of ammonia-forming organisms in the gut,Reduces absorption of spironolactone,D,"Lactulose, an osmotic laxative:  causes hypomagnesaemia associated with diarrhoea is not absorbed does not affect the absorption of spironolactone, and may be used in diabetics.  It is used in patients with cirrhosis/hepatic encephalopathy to limit the proliferation of ammonia-forming gut organisms and increase the clearance of protein load in the gut."
gastrointestinal system,314,"A 58-year-old man presents to your clinic with dysphagia for solids for the past three months. He also complains of weight loss and loss of appetite. There is no other past medical history, apart from symptoms of indigestion and heartburn for the past five years. He regularly takes Gaviscon and Rennie tablets. He is a heavy smoker and a regular drinker. He undergoes endoscopy, which reveals a small tumour at the lower end of the oesophagus. What is the most likely aetiological cause for the tumour?",Familial adenomatous polyposis,Barrett's oesophagus,Helicobacter pylori,Oesophageal candidiasis,Oesophageal pouch,B,"The history suggests a five-year history of gastro-oesophageal reflux. This can cause metaplasia of the oesophageal mucosa, resulting in replacement of the normal squamous epithelium with columnar epithelium (also known as Barrett's oesophagus), which is a premalignant state. Surveillance endoscopies are recommended every two to five years, depending on the length of the Barrett's segment, for metaplasia. The detection of dysplasia prompts more intense surveillance or therapeutic intervention. The development of dysphagia for solids and weight loss suggests the presence of oesophageal carcinoma. "
gastrointestinal system,315,"A 35-year-old obese Afro-Caribbean lady presents with abnormal liver function tests. She claims to be a teetotaler and her BMI is 30 kg/m^2. Investigations reveal the following results:    Haemoglobin 140 g/L (115-165)   U+Es Normal -   Bilirubin 25 µmol/L (1-22)   Aspartate transaminase 140 U/L (1-31)   Alanine transaminase 155 U/L (5-35)   Alkaline phosphatase 160 U/L (60-110)   Random blood glucose 11.2 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Hepatitis A IgG Positive -   Hepatitis B and C screening Negative -   Antinuclear antibodies 1:16 titre -    Ultrasound abdomen reveals hyperechogenic hepatic parenchyma. Liver biopsy reveals lesions suggestive of alcoholic liver disease. On review of her notes, liver function tests performed six months previously showed similar values. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcoholic liver disease,Autoimmune hepatitis,Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Viral hepatitis,C,"This is a case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, the diagnosis of which is made only by histology of liver biopsy which shows lesions suggestive of ethanol intake in a patient known to consume less than 40 g of alcohol per week. The diagnosis is supported by the presence of obesity, hyperglycaemia, and hyperechogenic hepatic parenchyma. In alcoholic hepatitis, the AST is normally raised more than the ALT typically with a ratio of at least 2:1."

Hence there must be another reason in this case. The only abnormal result given is a raised IgG. This suggests that myeloma is the diagnosis. Plasma immunoelectrophoresis to look for an M and paraportein band is the most appropriate next investigation. If the pararotein is monoclonal it is a malignant process, if it is polyclonal it is a reactive process. A bone marrow trephine is the definitive investigation but is traumatic and painful to the patient and so is not the next investigation of choice."

Barium swallow is not the usual first line investigation, with upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy preferred for the majority of patients. Magnesium trisilicate is an antacid used for short term relief of symptoms only. Ranitidine is predominantly used now as an over the counter indigestion relief tablet. Omeprazole is standard pharmacological therapy for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, although not until an endoscopy has excluded a serious underlying diagnosis in this case."

gastrointestinal system,322,Which of the following is true regarding total parenteral nutrition (TPN) delivered into a central vein?,Does not affect liver function tests,Contains typically 14-16 g nitrogen as D-amino acids,Contains typically 50 g glucose,Is a hypo-osmolar solution,Is associated with metabolic disturbances in about 5% patients,E,TPN can cause a range of metabolic complications including fluid and electrolyte imbalances; micronutrient and essential fatty acid deficiencies; glucose intolerance; metabolic acidosis; hepatic steatosis; and hyperlipidaemia. TPN is hyperosmolar. Consequently it is advocated that it is given centrally to reduce the risk of thrombophlebitis. Each bag typically contains 14-16 g of L-amino acids and 250 g of glucose. It can induce derangement of liver function and therefore liver function tests should be performed regularly. 
gastrointestinal system,323,A 19-year-old male presents vomiting fresh blood following a 48 hour drinking binge. He denies regular alcohol abuse. On examination he has a pulse of 92 beats per minute and a blood pressure of 146/90 mmHg. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aortoduodenal fistula,Mallory-Weiss tear,Meckel’s diverticulum,Oesophageal varices,Peptic ulcer,B,"Mallory-Weiss tears occur in the region of the gastro-oesophageal junction from forceful or prolonged coughing or vomiting, often after excessive alcohol intake. They may also be caused by epileptic convulsions. These tears result in vomiting bright red blood or by passing blood per rectum (melaena). Although bleeding can be profuse, it usually stops spontaneously. Aortoduodenal fistula results from erosion of the duodenum into the aorta due to tumour or previous repair of the aorta with a synthetic graft. Meckel's diverticulum occasionally occurs in the ileum and may contain ectopic gastric mucosa, which may result in rectal bleeding. Oesophageal varices represent dilated venous collaterals and result from portal hypertension in patients with liver cirrhosis. Bleeding from peptic ulcers is the commonest cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeds. Mucosal erosions develop, commonly due to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, steroids or prolonged alcohol abuse."
gastrointestinal system,324,Which of the following demonstrates autosomal co-dominant inheritance?,Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency,Cowden's disease,Familial adenomatous polyposis,Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia,Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,A,"Alpha-1-antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency is an autosomal co-dominant disorder - both alleles contribute to the phenotype. The most common allele is M (normal), whilst there are over 100 abnormal alleles (leading to decreased A1AT levels) the most common are Z and S. Individuals with a single normal allele may have reduced levels of A1AT but still produce sufficient normal protein to prevent development of a disease phenotype, this is why some texts will refer to the condition as autosomal recessive. In the disease state there is impaired cellular transport of alpha-1-antitrypsin leading to accumulation within the liver and hepatic injury.  Cowden's disease is an autosomal disorder resulting in multiple hamartomas of skin and mucous membranes. Familial adenomatous polyposis is the commonest adenomatous polyposis syndrome demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance. Hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia demonstrates autosomal dominant inheritance and is characterised by telangiectasia affecting the skin and mucous membranes; severe gastrointestinal haemorrhage may occur. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome demonstrates autosomal dominant inheritance. There is characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation; polyps can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract but are commonly in the small bowel. "
gastrointestinal system,325,"A 51-year-old male labourer presents with a haematemesis and undergoes urgent upper GI endoscopy. Using the Rockall score, which one of the following features would categorise him into a high risk group for a subject presenting with GI bleed?",A blood pressure of 134/88 mmHg,A history of ischaemic heart disease,A plasma glucose of 7.2 mmol/L,A pulse of 90 beats per minute,His age,B,"There are a number of available scoring systems which stratify subjects with gastrointestinal bleed into high and low risk groups. The Rockall scoring system is based on:  Age (the higher the age the worse the prognosis) Comorbidities, e.g. ischaemic heart disease (IHD) Presence of shock, and Endoscopic abnormalities.  The Canadian Consensus Conference Statement utilises a similar system, incorporating endoscopic factors including:  Active bleeding Major stigmata of recent haemorrhage Ulcers greater than 2 cm in diameter, and The location of ulcers in proximity to large arteries.  The Baylor bleeding score attaches a score to pre- and post-endoscopic features. The Blatchford score is based on clinical parameters alone:  Elevated blood urea nitrogen Reduced haemoglobin A drop in systolic blood pressure Raised pulse rate The presence of melaena or syncope, and Evidence of hepatic or cardiac disease."
gastrointestinal system,326,Which of the following symptoms is most commonly seen in patients with achalasia?,Aspiration,Dysphagia to liquids,Dysphagia to solids,Regurgitation,Retrosternal fullness,C,"Dysphagia is the most common symptom in patients with achalasia, with 91% presenting with dysphagia to solids and 85% with dysphagia to liquids. Achalasia involves the selective loss of inhibitory neurones in the myenteric plexus. This leads to the production of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, nitric oxide, and inflammatory infiltrate responsible for abnormal lower oesophageal sphincter dysfunction and failure to relax in response to swallowing. The mechanisms responsible for the loss of inhibitory neurones is not well understood. Previous studies suggest hereditary, neurodegenerative, genetic, infectious and autoimmune mechanisms. It is thought most likely to be caused by viral and autoimmune factors leading to the inflammatory changes and damage to the myenteric plexus. Regurgitation of undigested food or saliva also occurs in patients with achalasia and regurgitation may lead to aspiration (occurring in 8%). Patients may also suffer from a sensation of retrosternal fullness following a meal. "
gastrointestinal system,327,A 64-year-old alcoholic who has been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis presents with a massive ascites. What is the mechanism of fluid accumulation in a patient with liver disease?,Cirrhosis,Portal HTN,Hypoalbuminemia,Liver failure,Hepatic encephalopathy,C,"Mechanism of fluid accumulation (in general, not only ascites) is hypoalbuminaemia"
gastrointestinal system,328,Which of the following analgesics would be most suitable for the management of liver capsule pain?,Codeine,Dexamethasone,Naproxen,Oramorph,Paracetamol,B,"Corticosteroids can be used in the management of liver capsule pain and dexamethasone is usually the choice of steroid. Pain-sensitive structures in the region of the liver include the liver capsule, vessel, and biliary tract. Stretching of the liver capsule by a primary hepatoma or metastases within the liver can cause chronic cancer pain. This commonly presents as dull, right-sided subcostal pain. Referred pain at the top of the ipsilateral shoulder occurs due to diaphragmatic irritation if the superior aspect of the capsule is involved. Dexamethasone 8-16 mg can be administered in single or divided doses. If there is no improvement after four to seven days of use then it should be discontinued by gradually reducing the dose by 2-4 mg every three to five days with the aim of stopping completely. "
gastrointestinal system,329,Which of the following stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas and liver?,Cholecystokinin (CCK),Gastrin,Motilin,Secretin,Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP),D,"Secretin is secreted from the small intestine when there is acid in the small intestine. It inhibits gastric motility and acid production and stimulates bicarbonate secretion from the pancreas and liver. CCK stimulates gallbladder emptying and pancreatic enzyme release. Gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion and gastric motility. Motilin stimulates intestinal peristalsis. VIP induces smooth muscle relaxation, stimulates secretion of water into pancreatic juice and bile, and causes inhibition of gastric acid secretion; whilst in the intestine, it greatly stimulates secretion of water and electrolytes."
gastrointestinal system,330,Which of the following is true regarding carcinoma of the pancreas?,Has a better prognosis than ampullary adenocarcinoma,Is less common in smokers,Is most commonly situated in the body of the pancreas,Is not associated with chronic pancreatitis,Rarely causes pancreatic calcification,E,"Pancreatic cancer is the 10th most common cause of cancer deaths in the UK. Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas is highly malignant and has usually metastasised by the time of diagnosis due to the extensive lymphatic drainage of the pancreas to other organs. The disease occurs most commonly in head of the pancreas (in 80% of cases). Risk factors for the development of pancreatic cancer include:  smoking obesity diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis.  "
gastrointestinal system,331,What factor is not associated with an increased risk of developing a peptic ulcer?,NSAIDs,Zollinger Ellison syndrome,H. pylori infection,Smoking,Stress,E,Stress is the only option that has not been proven to lead to an increased risk of peptic ulcer disease.
gastrointestinal system,332,A 54-year-old woman presented with an 18-month history of chest pain and dysphagia for both solids and liquids. She smokes 20 cigarettes per day and drinks 16 units of alcohol per week. Clinical examination was normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Achalasia,Bronchial neoplasm,Oesophageal neoplasm,Oesophageal web,Pharyngeal pouch,A,"A longstanding history of dysphagia to both solids and liquids suggests a functional rather than mechanical cause for the dysphagia. This patient has dysphagia to both liquids and solids. This pattern of dysphagia is usually suggestive of a motility disorder rather than an obstructive issue. Obstructive causes tend to cause progressive symptoms and a bronchial carcinoma large enough to cause significant oesophageal compression is likely to be so advanced that 18-month survival without treatment and no other additional symptoms would be a rarity. Dysphagia as a function of extrinsic compression of any source, but particularly due to a large bronchial Ca is comparatively rare compared to oesophageal causes. Hence a neoplasm or other obstructive lesion is unlikely. Chest pain is not a typical feature of a pharyngeal pouch. Achalasia, in which there is failure of oesophageal peristalsis and of relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter, typically causes the symptoms described above."
gastrointestinal system,333,From where is the hormone somatostatin released?,Duodenum,Jejunum,Liver,Pancreas,Stomach,D,Somatostatin is released from delta cells in the pancreas and is a strong inhibitor of insulin and glucagon secretion. 
gastrointestinal system,334,"In ulcerative colitis, which of the following is not an indication for the use of Azathioprine?",Two or more steroid courses in one year,Disease relapses after reducing steroids,As first line with mesalazine,Disease relapses within 6 weeks of stopping steroids,Intolerant to steroids,C,All are indications for the use of azathioprine except it is not commonly utilised as a first line management with mesalazine.
gastrointestinal system,335,"A 46-year-old male returns from Spain with jaundice. His liver function tests show a raised bilirubin of 74 µmol/L (2-18), with the remainder of the liver profile and INR being normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alcoholic hepatitis,Crigler-Najjar type 1,Gilbert's syndrome,Hepatitis A,Wilson's disease,C,"The diagnosis of Gilbert's is based on a bilirubin of less than 102 µmol/L and otherwise normal liver function. Patients with Crigler-Najjar type I do not survive to adulthood, whereas those with type II do. Both syndromes are due to defects in the glucuronosyl transferase enzyme complex, responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin. Gilbert's affects 2-7% of the population and there is a family history of jaundice in 5-15% of patients. Bilirubin rises on fasting and mild illness. Hepatitis of any cause (including Wilson's disease) will show abnormal liver enzyme levels."
gastrointestinal system,336,A 55-year-old man has had severe pain in the right hypochondrium for 24 hours. The pain comes in waves and is accompanied by nausea. Nothing seems to relieve the pain. He feels hot and sweaty but has normal temperature. What is the most appropriate next investigation?,US Abdomen,ERCP,MRCP,Serum amylase,UGI endoscopy,A,The features like i) severe right hypochondrial pain. ii) colicky nature of the pain (comes in waves) iii) nausea iv) absence of fever iv) absence of jaundice favours diagnosis of biliary colic and most appropriate next investigation is US abdomen
gastrointestinal system,337,A 16-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis presents with abdominal pain. There is no associated nausea and vomiting.  Which of the following is most likely to be the cause?,Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome,Irritable bowel syndrome,Pyelonephritis,Renal calculi,Ulcerative colitis,A,"Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome occurs in 10-20% of patients with cystic fibrosis and incidence increases with age. About 80% of cases present for the first time in adults. The pathogenesis is partially due to loss of CFTR function in the intestine which results in deregulation of chloride secretion from the crypts, bicarbonate secretion from Brunner's glands and sodium transport. This leads to the accumulation of viscous mucus and faecal material in the terminal ileum, caecum and ascending colon. Investigation should include a plain abdominal radiograph which classically shows faecal loading in the right iliac fossa, dilatation of the ileum and an empty distal colon. Ultrasound may be helpful in identifying an obstruction mass but cannot be relied upon to exclude other causes of pain and bowel obstruction. CT can help with diagnosis and shows dilated small bowel and proximal colon with or without intestinal wall swelling. Treatment for mild and moderate episodes is initially with hydration and full dietetic review to ensure that the pancreatic enzyme dose is titrated to fat intake. Regular laxatives should be given, for example senna and lactulose. In addition. N-acetylcysteine can be used in moderate episodes. This loosens and softens the plugs, presumably by 'opening' the disulphide bonds in the abnormal intestinal mucus and maintains luminal patency. Severe episodes can be treated with gastrograffin or Klean-Prep taken regularly. If there are signs of peritoneal irritation or complete bowel obstruction, surgical review should be obtained. Surgeons will often treat initially with intravenous fluids and a NG tube whilst keeping the patient nil by mouth. N-acetylcysteine can be put down the NG tube. In resistant cases phosphate or gastrograffin enemas can be used, or colonscopy with installation of gastrograffin. "
gastrointestinal system,338,The C282Y mutation on chromosome 6 is associated with which disease?,Haemophilia A,HNPCC,FAP,Haemochromatosis,Gilberts syndrome,D,The C282Y mutation of HFE on chromosome 6 is the most common mutation which leads to hereditary haemochromatosis.
gastrointestinal system,339,With which of the following is ascites complicating cirrhosis usually associated?,A low serum sodium,Decreased renin levels,Increased vascular resistance,Reduced urinary potassium excretion,Reduced urinary sodium excretion,E,"It should be remembered that a patient with ascites complicating cirrhosis will have hyperaldosteronism, i.e. sodium retention with consequent potassium loss. There is:  Decreased vascular resistance Increased plasma volume High serum sodium Low serum potassium and low magnesium, and Raised renin level."
gastrointestinal system,340,Which of the following drugs does not undergo extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism?,Budesonide,Carvedilol,Ketoconazole,Salbutamol,Warfarin,E,The correct answer is warfarin. The remaining listed drugs all undergo extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism. 
gastrointestinal system,341,"A 24-year-old man has returned a few days earlier from a Nile cruise. He has begun suffering from profuse bloody diarrhoea. He opens his bowels several times per day, and blood and mucus are mixed in with the motion each time. He is also complaining of dull abdominal pain. There is no past medical history of note. On further questioning, he admits to buying fruit from local stalls on the river side. On examination, he has a low grade temperature of 37.8°C, and has generalised lower abdominal tenderness. His other observations are stable. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 121 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 11.4 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 204 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 125 μmol/L (60-120)   Stool Blood   White cells ++   Trophozoites    Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapy?",IV cefotaxime,Oral ciprofloxacin,Oral diloxanide,Oral metronidazole,Supportive therapy only with fluid resuscitation,D,"This man has amoebic dysentery which occurs around seven days after exposure to Entamoeba histolytica. Acute amoebic dysentery is managed with a course of oral metronidazole or tinidazole, to be followed by a ten-day course of diloxanide to eradicate colonisation of the gut. With appropriate diagnosis and treatment, mortality from amoebiasis is less than 1%. Amoebic liver abscess may appear at any time from eight weeks after infection, and presents with night sweats, anorexia, and right upper quadrant pain."
gastrointestinal system,342,"A 60-year-old man presents with a five-day history of lower abdominal pain and diarrhoea. He has a history of chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) and has had numerous acute infective exacerbations over the last three months. On examination, he was dehydrated, with a temperature of 38.6°C, a blood pressure of 102/72 mmHg and has a distended, tender abdomen. Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",Chest x ray,Plain abdominal x ray,Sigmoidoscopy and biopsy,Stool microscopy,Ultrasound scan of the abdomen,B,"This is pseudomembranous colitis due to Clostridium difficile secondary to antibiotic usage for his COAD. Plain AXR is useful for diagnosing toxic dilatation and would be the investigation of choice here due to his abdominal distension. Toxic dilatation should be excluded prior to sigmoidoscopy. However, it does not establish the diagnosis. Stool microscopy has no value but stool toxin assay is useful. A patient with diarrhoea normally has involvement of the distal colon; rectum and sigmoidoscopy with biopsy is helpful for rapid diagnosis but should not be performed if toxic dilatation is suspected. Patients with involvement of right colon usually have little or no diarrhoea."
gastrointestinal system,343,"A 68-year-old man presents with a history of abdominal discomfort that is relieved by passing flatus and stool. His symptoms have been present on and off for six or seven years and have improved with the reduction of dairy products in his diet. In the past month, his stools have been looser in nature but there is no passage of blood or mucus. He has lost 3 kg in weight over the last month and his appetite is reduced. There is no family history of note. Examination of the abdomen is unremarkable and rectal examination is normal. Which ONE of the following is the most appropriate diagnostic investigation?",Barium enema,Barium follow through,Colonoscopy,CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis,Flexible sigmoidoscopy,C,"This man may have irritable bowel syndrome or diverticular disease. The symptoms of benign disease and malignancy are frequently similar and malignancy may arise equally in patients with a long or short history of a change in bowel habit. Change in bowel habit due to malignancy may arise due to the partially obstructing effects of a bowel cancer and is always significant. Weight loss may be caused by dietary modification but may also indicate metastatic spread of a cancer. A diagnosis of colon cancer, diverticular disease, or colonic inflammation is most readily excluded by colonoscopy and biopsy and this is initially the most helpful investigation. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is helpful in the investigation of patients with symptoms typical of benign anorectal disease such as painful bright red bleeding during or after the passage of a stool but colonoscopy remains the preferred investigation for a possible cancer, inflammatory bowel disease or diverticular disease. If colonoscopy is normal the patient will require further investigation of his symptoms. Irritable bowel syndrome remains a diagnosis of exclusion."
gastrointestinal system,344,Which of the following stimulates the secretion of gastrin?,Amino acids,Fasting,High level gastric acid in the stomach,Low gastric pH,Somatostatin,A,"Gastrin is released from specialised endocrine cells, called G cells, in response to a meal. Protein, peptides, and amino acids are specific components which will stimulate gastrin release. Fasting and increased gastric acid in the stomach both inhibit the release of gastrin. High gastric pH is a strong stimulus for the secretion of gastrin. G cells are tightly regulated by two hormones: gastrin-releasing peptide has a stimulatory effect causing the secretion of gastrin, while somatostatin is inhibitory."
gastrointestinal system,345,"A 35-year-old female presents with acute severe abdominal pain associated with tachycardia, hypotension and tachypnoea. Which of the following is likely concerning the finding of a raised serum amylase in this patient?",Could indicate a perforated duodenal ulcer,Is diagnostic of acute pancreatitis,Makes diabetic ketoacidosis less likely,Makes ectopic pregnancy less likely,Makes mesenteric ischaemia less likely,A,A raised serum amylase may occur in all these conditions.
gastrointestinal system,346,A patient admitted due to repeated attacks of pancreatitis presents with dementia and loss of proprioception in the legs. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Thiamine,Pyridoxine,Cobolamin,Lipase,Antibiotics,C,"Pancreatic insufficiency can lead to malabsorption and B12 (cobalamin) deficiency. Dementia and diminished vibratory sensation and proprioception in the lower extremities were the most common objective findings of cobalamin deficiency. The damage to the myelin due to cobalamin deficiency results in a condition known as subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord (SCDSC). This condition affects various parts of the spinal cord, including the dorsal columns, the lateral corticospinal tracts, and the spinocerebellar tracts, resulting in a loss of proprioception, ataxia, the development of peripheral neuropathy, and dementia"
gastrointestinal system,347,"A 42 year old male who is obese and has type 2 diabetes mellitus has been found to have deranged LFTs on routine bloods.  He gives a vague history of fatigue and right upper quadrant pain.  On examination it is difficult to assess if there is hepatomegaly due to his BMI.  He denies any excessive alcohol intake, blood transfusion or IV drug use.  His liver screen is negative.  An ultrasound reveals a hyperechogenic bright liver.  Given the most likely diagnosis what would you expect to see on liver biopsy?",Fatty infiltration,Regenerating nodules,"Fatty infiltration, inflammation and fibrosis",Nil,Lymphoid follicles and plasma cell infiltration,C,"The history of obesity and type 2 diabetes and lack of alcohol history and negative liver screen makes non alcoholic steatohepatitis most likely.  NASH can lead onto cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.  Obesity, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia are risk factors for its development.  It leads to similar changes as alcohol liver disease with fatty infiltration, inflammation and fibrosis.  This is thought to be secondary to triglyceride and lipid accumulation in hepatocytes."
gastrointestinal system,348,"A 62-year-old surgical patient has undergone anterior resection for a rectal mass. The histology report describes a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which invades into the muscle, but not through the wall. One out of 13 lymph nodes is involved by metastatic tumour, but the high tie node is tumour free. A liver biopsy from a suspicious lesion in the liver shows 'no evidence of malignancy'. What stage is this patient's cancer?",Dukes' A,Dukes' B,Modified Dukes' C1,Modified Dukes' C2,Modified Dukes' D,C,This patient has Dukes' grade C1 carcinoma of the colon as local nodes are involved but apical nodes are spared.  Dukes' A involve lesions confined to the bowel wall Dukes' B reach the serosa Dukes' C2 involve the apical nodes Dukes' D with the worst prognosis have distant metastases.
gastrointestinal system,349,Which of the following is correct regarding solitary rectal ulcer syndrome?,The highest incidence is seen between the ages of 55 and 75 years,The surrounding mucosa is usually normal,The ulcers are usually located on the posterior rectal wall,There is a weak association with rectal prolapse,Ulcer histology is helpful in making the diagnosis,E,"There are well described histological abnormalities in the condition. Many of the epithelial cells demonstrate cytological atypia with:  Hyperchromasia Eosinophilic nucleoli Pleomorphism, and Mitoses.  These cytological features may suggest high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma, but the cells typically show evenly distributed chromatin and evidence of maturation toward the luminal surface in contrast to cells from neoplastic tissue. Important additional differential diagnostic considerations include:  Inflammatory pseudopolyps of ulcerative and Crohn's colitis Ischaemia Benign pseudopolyps Drugs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs, corticosteroids, and oral contraceptives) Infection, and Stercoral ulceration associated with faecal stasis.  Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is most common between the ages of 25 and 35 years, but has been described in elderly patients. The surrounding non-ulcerated mucosa usually has characteristic histological findings. The ulcers are usually located 6-12 cm above the anus. Rectal prolapse can be shown in the majority of patients. The aetiology is thought to involve chronic trauma due to repeated mucosal prolapse associated with puborectalis muscle dysfunction. Persistent contraction of the puborectalis muscle during attempted defecation maintains an acute anorectal angle, which keeps the anal canal closed and results in increased intra-rectal pressure. This leads to severe straining during defecation in an attempt to overcome the functional obstruction. Consequently, the mucosa of the anterior rectal wall is forced against or into the anal canal, and the stress of repeated mucosal prolapse induces focal ischaemia and ultimately ulceration. Patients will often report attempts to remove hard stool digitally from the rectum; self-induced trauma may thus also contribute to ulceration."
gastrointestinal system,350,A man is admitted with acute abdominal pain and vomiting. He is diagnosed and treated for acute pancreatitis. Which of the following features is associated with a worse prognosis in acute pancreatitis?,Plasma glucose of 11.9mmol/L (3.5-5.5),Plasma sodium of 125 mmol/L (133-144),Serum amylase of 1200 IU/L (24-100),The patient is 50 years of age,White cell count of 13.9 ×10^9/L,A,"There are a number of criteria used in the Ranson's scoring system which reflect prognosis associated with acute pancreatitis. Ranson's criteria on admission that signify a worse prognosis include: Criteria present at 0 hours:  Age greater than55 years old: 1 point WBC greater than16 ×10^9: 1 point Glucose greater than11.0 mmol/L: 1 point LDH greater than350 U/L: 1 point AST greater than250 U/L: 1 point  Criteria present at 48 hours:  Hematocrit fall of 10% or greater: 1 point Urea rise of 1.8 mmol/L or more despite fluids: 1 point Serum Calcium less than2 mmol/L: 1 point pO2 less than60 mmHg: 1 point Base deficit greater than4 meq/L: 1 point Fluid sequestration greater than6000 mL: 1 point  The Glasgow pancreatitis score is simpler so tends to be used in preference to the Ranson score. Dr John Ranson graduated from Oxford in1963 before moving to the USA. He was surgeon at New York University Medical Centre. The Ranson criteria were published in 1974. He died, aged 57 in 1995."
gastrointestinal system,351,Oxygen-requiring metabolic reactions occur predominantly in which type of liver cells?,Ito (stellate) cells,Kupffer cells,Zone 1 hepatocytes,Zone 2 hepatocytes,Zone 3 hepatocytes,C,"The liver is made up of many small subunits called acini. Each acinus has a dual blood supply from firstly, a branch of the hepatic artery (oxygen rich) and secondly, a branch of the portal vein (solute rich). The blood from these flows though the hepatic sinusoids which allow quite free movement of solutes and oxygen from the blood cells into the hepatocytes. Eventually the blood joins a venule and drains into the hepatic vein and back to the systemic circulation. Hepatocytes near the hepatic arterial supply and portal vein supply (periportal region) are called zone 1 hepatocytes. Zone 3 hepatocytes are furthest from the arterial supply and closest to the branch of the hepatic vein (perivenular region). Zone 2 hepatocytes are in the middle. Zone 1 hepatocytes receive an oxygen-rich, solute-rich supply which makes them highly metabolically active, but more at risk of damage through the effects of toxins coming from the gut. Most of the highly oxygen-requiring reactions occur here including the electron transport chains, Krebs' cycle, fatty acid oxidation, and urea synthesis. Zones 2 and 3 receive less oxygen and tend to be involved in reactions requiring little or no oxygen, such as glycolysis. Ito cells store fats and vitamin A and are involved in production of connective tissue. In liver disease, they are thought to be fundamental in the development of fibrosis and cirrhosis. Kupffer cells are part of the reticuloendothelial system and are specialised macrophages. They are involved in the breakdown of haemoglobulin and the removal of haem for further metabolism in the hepatocytes. Kupffer cells also have a role in immunity."
gastrointestinal system,352,"A 33-year-old woman has worsening crampy, lower abdominal pain for two days. She has had less severe intermittent pain for three weeks. She has diarrhoea 8-10 times/day and loss of appetite. She has lost 2 stone in weight in the last three months. She has not noticed any blood in her stool. She returned from a holiday visiting her parents in India a month ago. She pale and her temperature is 37.8°C. She has a slightly tender mass in the right iliac fossa.  Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Appendix abscess,Acute diverticulitis,Crohn's disease,Ileocaecal tuberculosis,Ulcerative colitis,C,"This patient is most likely to have Crohn's disease. The precise aetiology of Crohn's disease remains unclear, however the following have all been implicated:  An altered response by the body's immune system to normal intestinal bacteria Smoking Environmental factors Familial predisposition Pathogenic bacteria, and Viruses.  The most common presentation of patients with Crohn's disease is related to a chronic inflammatory process involving the ileocaecal region which includes low-grade fever, loss of appetite, weight loss, anaemia and general fatigue. The patients may have crampy or constant pain over the umbilical region or over the right iliac fossa. The pain may be relieved by defecation. Diarrhoea may be troublesome. This is usually non-bloody and intermittent. If the colon is involved, patients may present with diffuse abdominal pain accompanied by mucus, blood and pus in the stool. Perianal fissures or fistulae may be present. Acute exacerbation of Crohn's disease affecting the terminal ileum (terminal ileitis) may be difficult to differentiate from acute appendicitis, although the symptoms associated with Crohn's disease tend to be of insidious onset. Abdominal ultrasound, small bowel enemas and CT scan may help to establish the diagnosis. However, if the diagnosis remains uncertain and the patient becomes clinically unstable, a laparotomy may be indicated. The management of Crohn's disease depends on the severity and the stage of the disease. The treatment may be conservative (including medical) or surgical. Some important complications of Crohn's disease include:  Fistula formation (for example, entero-colic, entero-cutaneous) Abscesses (for example, perianal) Haemorrhage, and Intestinal obstruction."
gastrointestinal system,353,Intussusception is associated with which of the following?,An abdominal mass,An empty rectum on examination,Fever,Fluid levels on a supine abdominal x ray,Reduced bowel sounds,A,"An infant presenting with sudden onset of colicky abdominal pain needs to be assessed for intussusception. There is not usually any fever. The baby may have a palpable abdominal lump in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Erect abdominal x ray may show signs of small bowel obstruction. The diagnosis is confirmed by ultrasonography, or with a barium enema, which may reveal the claw sign at the point of the bowel invagination. Hydrostatic enema is the mainstay of non-operative treatment, whereby reduction can be achieved."
gastrointestinal system,354,A 35 year old has H. Pylori eradication. Which of the following investigations would you organise to confirm eradication?,Stool test,Repeat endoscopy and biopsy for culture,13c breath test,Repeat endoscopy and biopsy for rapid urease test,Serology,C,To confirm eradication has been successful then a urea/13c breath test should be performed as it is non invasive and highly sensitive and specific. It also is quickly negative following eradication whilst serology can take over a year for titre levels to fall by 50%. The stool test for H pylori is also sensitive and specific but is less commonly used. Culture and rapid urease breath test require and invasive endoscopy to be performed and therefore are inappropriate.
gastrointestinal system,355,Which is correct regarding colorectal carcinoma?,In familial cases the inheritance pattern is typically autosomal recessive,In familial polyposis coli the increased cancer risk is due to inheritance of a mutated suppressor gene,"In non-familial cases, gene mutations in the cancer cells are unusual",It is a rare feature of the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome,It occurs most commonly in the ascending colon,B,"The rectum and sigmoid colon are the commonest sitesfor colon cancer. Both familial polyposis coli and Gardner's syndrome are autosomal dominant. An allelic deletion of a putative tumour suppressor gene on 5q. Quantitative and qualitative alterations in gene expression accumulate in colorectal cancer cells. These include alterations of pro-oncogene expression and chromosomal abnormalities (deletions at 17p and 18q are seen in 70% of colorectal carcinomas). Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is dominantly inherited pigmentation of skin and mucous membranes, and hamartomatous polyps in the stomach, small intestine and colon There is an increased risk of all gastrointestinal cancers (including pancreas and also breast, cervix, ovary and testis). The highest relative risk is for the small intestine but the highest absolute risk is for colon cancer as this is a far more common disease."
gastrointestinal system,356,"A group of construction workers presented to the emergency department with diarrhoea, flushing, sweating and a hot mouth. They fell ill minutes after eating lunch in the staff canteen. They admitted that they had eaten tuna fish. What is the likely cause of food poisoning?",Clostridium perfringens,Heavy metal,Mushroom,Scombrotoxin,Staphylococcus aureus,D,"Scombrotoxin food poisoning is caused by the ingestion of foods that contain high levels of histamine and possibly other vasoactive amines and compounds. Histamine and other amines are formed by the growth of certain bacteria and the subsequent action of their decarboxylase enzymes on histidine and other amino acids in food, by spoilage of foods such as fishery products, particularly tuna or mahi-mahi. Incubation period is 10-60 minutes."
gastrointestinal system,357,Which of the following statements regarding jejunal biopsy is correct?,Electron microscopy is necessary to confirm the presence of villous atrophy,In tropical countries apparently healthy people have a mucosal structure which would be regarded as abnormal in Europe,It can be used to diagnose Whipple's disease,It is contraindicated over the age of 70 years,Sub-total villous atrophy is diagnostic of gluten-sensitive enteropathy and is not found in other conditions,C,"Subtotal villous atrophy is seen in a number of conditions other than coeliac disease, such as:  severe tropical sprue cow's milk/soya sensitivity in children gastroenteritis Whipple's disease hypogammaglobulinaemia neomycin therapy laxative abuse, and Norwalk agent.  The villous atrophy may be seen with a magnifying glass. There is a group of patients who present with coeliac disease in older age - sometimes in their 90s. They present with iron deficiency anaemia, osteoporosis or weight loss."
gastrointestinal system,358,"A 46 year old female presents with fatigue, myalgia and pruritus.  She is complaining of vague right upper quadrant pain and has noticed her skin and eyes appearing yellow in colour.  On examination there is evidence of hepatomegaly and jaundice. Bloods reveal deranged LFTs (predominantly raised aminotransferases), a normocytic anaemia, elevated IgGs and anti nuclear antibodies and anti smooth muscle antibodies.  She is commenced on steroids and azathioprine however she continues to deteriorate and now presents with decompensated cirrhosis.  What is the next management step?",Budesonide,Ursodeoxycholic acid,Ciclosporin,Liver transplantation,Methotrexate,D,"The most likely diagnosis is autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease where there is hepatocellular inflammation and necrosis which can lead onto to cirrhosis. It typically presents as in this case and type 2 autoimmune hepatitis tends to effect younger individuals and children and is associated with LKM1 autoantibodies.  In type 2 there is often other autoimmune diseases associated such as inflammatory bowel disease, ITP, graves disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and many more.  In type 1 autoimmune hepatitis there is ANA, anti smooth muscle antibodies and raised IgG.  It is less often associated with other disease.  Liver biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis and staging.  The mainstay of the management of AIH is corticosteroids with or without azathioprine.  Liver transplantation should be considered for those with decompensated cirrhosis, failure of medical therapy or fulminant liver failure.  The prognosis is good with approximately 90%, 5 year survival."

She appears to be tachycardic and in shock. She was found to have gallstones, 2 years ago. What is the most likely investigation to confirm diagnosis?",US abdomen,LFT,Serum lipase,Angiography,CT abdomen,C,"The likely diagnosis is pancreatitis. A normal lipase level can range from 0-160 U/L depending on the lab. When the pancreas is damaged, these digestive enzymes can be found in the blood at higher levels than normal. Amylase or lipase results more than three times normal levels are likely to mean pancreatitis"
gastrointestinal system,360,"A 37-year-old homeless gentleman with a history of alcohol excess presents to hospital with progressive abdominal distension. He now complains of early satiety and abdominal discomfort as a result of the distension. Examination reveals a significantly distended abdomen with shifting dullness. An ascitic tap is performed and the fluid sent for analysis. According to the British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of ascites, what is the most appropriate first-line treatment for his ascites?",Amiloride,Dietary salt restriction,Furosemide,Paracentesis,Spironolactone,D,"The treatment of choice for large, symptomatic ascites is large volume therapeutic paracentesis. Where the volume of ascites is not sufficient to warrant paracentesis then first line treatment is dietary salt restriction (to no more than 90 mmol/day) and spironolactone. Initial dose of spironolactone in this setting is 100 mg/day and may be titrated up to 400 mg/day. Once the maximum dose of spironolactone has been reached furosemide can be added if there is still significant ascites accumulation and the renal function and electrolytes will tolerate further diuresis. Doses of furosemide are advised start at 40 mg/day titrating up to 160 mg/day as tolerated or needed. Furosemide alone has poor efficacy in cirrhosis. Amiloride is not generally recommended for use in cirrhosis and ascites as, although it produces a natriuresis, its efficacy is significantly inferior to spironolactone. Bumetanide may be used instead of furosemide."

gastrointestinal system,364,You are called to see a 56-year-old patient in the emergency department who has been diagnosed with large bowel obstruction. She reports longstanding constipation but the symptoms of abdominal pain and distension came on suddenly. There has been no bleeding or weight loss. Past medical history includes schizophrenia. Which of the following is the most likely cause?,Adhesions,Crohn’s disease,Incarcerated hernia,Intussusception,Volvulus of sigmoid colon,E,"Volvulus, faeces and tumours are common causes of large bowel obstruction. In this case the likely diagnosis given the long history of constipation and psychiatric illness and a short history of pain/distension in the absence of other gastrointestinal symptoms is sigmoid volvulus. The other conditions listed tend to result in small bowel obstruction."
gastrointestinal system,365,Which of the following statements regarding colon cancer is correct?,In familial cases the inheritance pattern is typically autosomal recessive,"In familial polyposis coli, the increased cancer risk is due to inheritance of a mutated tumour suppressor gene","In non-familial cases, gene mutations in the cancerous cells are unusual",It is a characteristic feature of the Peutz-Jegher syndrome,It occurs most commonly in the ascending colon,B,"Both familial polyposis coli and Gardner's syndrome are autosomal dominant. An allelic deletion of a putative tumour suppressor gene located 5q21-q22, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disorder causing extensive adenomatous polyps of the colon and early onset colorectal cancer. Quantitative and qualitative alterations in gene expression accumulate in colorectal cancer cells. These include alterations of pro-oncogene expression and chromosomal abnormalities (deletions at 17p and 18q are seen in 70% of colorectal carcinomas). Peutz-Jegher's syndrome is dominantly inherited pigmentation of skin and mucous membranes and hamartomatous polyps in the stomach and larger intestine. The polyps only rarely undergo malignant change. The rectum and sigmoid colon are the commonest sites, not the ascending colon."
gastrointestinal system,366,A study reports on the results of a large study of the primary prevention of stroke in a diabetic population using a new antiplatelet agent versus aspirin. The results of the study reveal that over a five year period the incidence of stroke in the aspirin treated group is 3% compared to a rate of 1.5% in the group treated with the new antiplatelet agent (pless than0.001). What is the relative risk reduction in stroke associated with the new drug?,1.50%,15%,30%,40%,50%,E,"The relative risk reduction is another caculation important for the interpretation of publications. In this case there is an absolute risk reduction of 1.5% (3 − 1.5%) in stroke afforded by the new agent compared with aspirin yet the relative risk reduction is 1.5/3 = 50%. That is 50% fewer strokes may be prevented by the use of the newer agent compared with aspirin, although this would be the equivalent of 15 per 1000 patients treated (30 strokes expected/1000 patients treated with aspirin but only 15 with the new drug)."

Aphthous ulceration is common in active disease. Aphthous ulcers and glossitis are both features of coeliac disease. Patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome have characteristic mucocutaneous pigmentation, that is, perioral freckling. Gingival fibromas are seen in tuberous sclerosis. "
gastrointestinal system,369,Which is correct regarding Hirschsprung's disease?,Always requires an emergency colostomy,Has reduced acetylcholinesterase activity on histology,Is due to absence of ganglion cells in Auerbach's plexus,Rarely presents with neonatal large bowel obstruction,Shows dilatation of the aganglionic segment on contrast study,C,"Hirschsprung's disease is a common cause of neonatal large bowel obstruction. It results from failure of migration of ganglion cells to the affected segment of bowel. This always involves the distal colon, but the proximal extent of the involvement is variable, and in rare cases may involve the whole of the large bowel. Histologically, the affected segment has absent ganglion cells in the Meissner's and Auerbach's plexus, but immunohistochemical evidence of increased acetylcholinesterase activity. Eighty percent of cases present in the neonatal period. Contrast studies show the affected segment to be tonically contracted. Rectal irrigation or an emergency colostomy may be required before a definitive 'pull-through' procedure."
gastrointestinal system,370,Which of the following is true regarding colonic adenocarcinoma?,Is associated with Crohn's disease,Is more common in females,Is never familial,Is the second most common cause of cancer related death in men in the UK,Of the caecum usually presents with rectal bleeding,A,"There is an increased incidence in males compared to females (13:10). Rectal cancers often present with rectal bleeding, caecal cancers present with obstructive symptoms or a mass, classically on the acute take with small bowel obstruction and anaemia. Patients with familial adenopolyposis coli carry a genetic mutation (chromosome 5q21) which is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion and will develop adenocarcinoma of the colon. It is associated with ulcerative colitis and Crohn's. Lung is the most common cause of cancer related death in men, with prostate cancer the second most common cause and bowel cancer the third most common cause in men. However, bowel cancer is the second most common cause of deaths from cancer for combined males/female. "
gastrointestinal system,371,A 59 year old gentleman presents with melaena.  He is known to have hypertension and severe aortic stenosis.  On examination there is an ejection systolic murmur and on examination of the chest and abdomen there is no abnormalities detected.  His bloods reveal a microcytic anaemia and upper GI endoscopy is normal.  What is the next investigation to be performed?,CT Abdomen,Colonoscopy,Mesenteric angiography,Small bowel follow through,Haematinics,C,Mesenteric angiography should be performed.  In 40% of those with aortic stenosis has been associated with angiodysplasia of the bowel and therefore GI bleeding.  There are various theories regarding this and it being a connective tissue disorder.  Colonoscopy is useful as it will show any active bleeding points however some of the angiodysplastic lesions can be missed and thus mesenteric angiography has a higher sensitivity.
gastrointestinal system,372,A 20-year-old woman was referred for investigation of iron deficiency anaemia. Her mother died aged 28 years from colonic carcinoma complicating Peutz-Jegher syndrome. Which is the most likely mode of inheritance of Peutz-Jegher syndrome?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,Mitochondrial,Polygenic,X linked dominant,A,Peutz-Jegher syndrome is a condition characterised by perioral pigmentation and numerous hamartomas of the bowel. Originally it was assumed that these did not predispose to malignancy but studies now suggest the contrary. The condition is autosomal dominant.

Her mouth including her tongue appeared inflamed on examination. She smokes 20 cigarettes/day despite advice to quit. She attends her ANC regularly. What is the
most probable diagnosis?",Lichen planus,Aphthous ulcer,Smoking,Candidiasis,Leukoplakia,D,lichen planus may have lace like appearance and not thick white mark. Aphthous ulcer has yellowish floor and surrounded by erythematous halo. Smoking may cause tongue coating but not like thick white mark on the inside of mouth. Leukoplakia is with raised edges/Bright white patches and sharply defined and cannot be rubbed out like candida patch; here also inflammed tongue points towards infection. So candidiasis is the most probable option

Trophozoites and cysts are seen in acute amoebic dysentery, however, cysts may also be excreted in asymptomatic carrier states."
gastrointestinal system,376,A 65-year-old man is referred with abnormal liver function and undergoes a liver biopsy. Which of the following count against hepatic cirrhosis?,Fibrous septa formation ,Granuloma formation ,Liver cell necrosis,Nodular regeneration,Subendothelial fibrosis ,B,"Granuloma formation is not classically seen in cirrhosis, which can be micro- or macronodular in type. In the micronodular form, the nodules are less than 3 mm across with uniform liver involvement - seen in alcohol or biliary disease. In the macronodular form, there are larger nodules, classically seen in chronic viral hepatitis. "
gastrointestinal system,377,Characteristic features of achalasia of the oesophagus include which of the following?,Decreased lower oesophageal sphincter pressure,Dysphagia is an early feature,Interscapular pain,Iron deficiency,Normal histology of the oesophageal wall,B,"Achalasia is a functional obstruction of the lower oesphageal sphincter, with dilatation of the oesphagus above, caused by degeneration of the ganglion cells on the muscle of the mid and lower oesophagus. The diagnosis is made radiologically, and manometry confirms the diagnosis by showing an elevated sphincter pressure - there is a failure of relaxation of the sphincter. Dysphagia is an early feature, slowly progressive both for solids and liquids. Interscapular pain may be associated, though not characteristic. Oesophageal carcinoma is a rare complication. Iron deficiency is characteristically associated with a post-cricoid web (Patterson Brown-Kelly or Plummer Vinson syndrome) and unrelated disorder of the oesophagus."
gastrointestinal system,378,Which of the following is true of congenital pyloric stenosis?,Can cause hyperchloraemic alkalosis,Is inherited as an autosomal recessive,Is often diagnosed by feeling a mass in the right hypochondrium,Presents approximately three months after birth,Typically presents with bile stained vomiting after feeds,C,"Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis occurs in approximately 3:1,000 live births. Males (especially first born) are affected approximately four times as often as females. Family clustering occurs. Pyloric stenosis is associated with other congenital defects, including tracheo-oesophageal fistula. The vomiting usually starts after three weeks of age, but symptoms may develop as early as the first week of life, and as late as the fifth month. Non-bilious vomiting is the initial symptom, which progressively becomes more vigorous. As vomiting continues, there is a progressive loss of fluid, hydrogen ion, and chloride, leading to a hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis. The diagnosis is established by palpating the pyloric mass. The mass is firm, movable, approximately 2 cm in length, olive shaped, hard, best palpated from the left side, and located above and to the right of the umbilicus in the mid-epigastrium beneath the liver edge. Imaging procedures (USS or barium meal) are reserved for those infants in whom the diagnosis remains in doubt."

gastrointestinal system,381,In which part of the body is conjugated bilirubin metabolised to urobilinogen?,Common bile duct,Hepatic sinusoids,Large intestine,Small intestine,Splenic macrophages,C,"Unconjugated bilirubin is conjugated to glucuronic acid in the hepatocyte. Conjugated bilirubin passes into the enterohepatic circulation and the bilirubin which evades this system is metabolised by bacteria, primarily in the large intestine, to urobilinogen, then stercobilinogen and eventually oxidised to stercobilin. Stercobilin gives faeces its brown colour."
gastrointestinal system,382,A 25 year old presents with diarrhoea. She has had a previous ileal resection for Crohns Disease. She has also had two recent episodes of loin to groin pain. Her bloods are normal including her inflammatory markers What is the most likely diagnosis?,Coeliac Disease,IBS,Bacterial Overgrowth,Short bowel syndrome,Flare of Crohns Disease,D,This patient is likely to have a short bowel. There is no evidence of raised inflammatory markers thus worsening of Crohns is unlikely. In shirt bowel syndrome there is increased rate of renal stones of calcium oxalate type and this would explain the recent episodes of loin to groin pain. Short bowel syndrome can lead to diarrhoea due to lack of bile acids and colestyramine is useful. However often these patients require periods of TPN and vitamin supplementation.
gastrointestinal system,383,"A 64-year-old man is admitted with 12 hours of central and epigastric pain. An abdominal x ray shows a central, dilated small bowel loop. His temperature is 37.2°C, pulse regular at 130 beats per min,, blood pressure 95/55 mmHg, respiratory rate 29/min and SpO2 90% on air. His admission full blood count is:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 13.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 96 ×10^9/L (150-400)   MCV 105 fL (80-96)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Gall stone ileus,Ischaemic bowel,Pancreatitis,Perforated duodenal ulcer,Small bowel obstruction,C,"Ischaemic bowel and perforated duodenal ulcer would be high in the differential list. However, the history and raised mean corpuscular volume (MCV) suggests chronic high alcohol use and the severity of his observations would suggest a systemic inflammatory response which is more common with pancreatitis. Acute pancreatitis has a mortality of 7-10%, often due to sepsis or multi-organ failure. There are a number of scoring systems which can be used to guide prognosis, but they are unreliable within the first 48 hours o f the illness. Gallstones account for 50% of cases, with the majority of the rest being associated with alcohol. Patients typically present with severe epigastric pain which radiates to the back and vomiting. As seen in this example, there is often a systemic inflammatory response (SIRS) Amylase is markedly raised, often in excess of four times the normal value. Early complications include ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome), acute kidney injury and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Treatment is essentially supportive, and high levels of monitoring are usually required (often in the intensive care unit). Those patients who are found to have gallstones should be considered for urgent ERCP when stable. All should have a cholecystectomy either during the same admission or within 4 weeks depending on their clinical progress."
gastrointestinal system,384,Which of the following is true in gastric MALT lymphoma?,Associated paraproteinaemia is uncommon,Is associated with pernicious anaemia,Metastasises at an early stage,Prognosis is improved with gastrectomy for low grade disease,There is a strong association with Helicobacter pylori infection,E,"Gastric MALT lymphomas are associated with H. pylori infection in approximately 98% of cases, and all that is usually required in low grade disease is eradication therapy. High grade disease is best treated with chemotherapy, and the prognosis for these tumours is excellent. Paraproteinaemia is commonly found."
gastrointestinal system,385,Which of the following drugs is most likely to have caused a cholestatic jaundice even when taken at the correct dosage?,Naproxen,Phenytoin,Amoxicillin,Paracetamol,Flucloxacillin,E,"The most likely culprit from this list is flucloxacillin which can lead to a cholestatic jaundice. Co amoxiclav can also lead to a cholestatic jaundice and is much more likely to than amoxicillin. Azathioprine, erythromycin, ciclosporin and the oral contraceptive are also causative agents. Paracetamol and phenytoin tend to lead to a more hepatitic jaundice."
gastrointestinal system,386,A 50 year old female presents with fatigue and pruritus.  Bloods reveal a raised ALP and high normal bilirubin.  Antimitochondrial antibodies are found and raised IgM.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Primary Biliary Cirrhosis,Sarcoidosis,Autoimmune hepatitis,Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis,Alcohol liver disease,A,"Primary biliary cirrhosis leads to destruction of interlobular bile ducts due to chronic granulomatous inflammation causing progressive cholestasis, cirrhosis and portal hypertension.  It is thought to be autoimmune.  PBC is often found incidentally however common presenting features are fatigue and pruritus. Signs can occur later in the disease such as xanthelasma, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, hyperpigmentation and jaundice.  Early in the disease ALP is often the only abnormal blood findings although later bilirubin and transaminases can become elevated.  It can be associated with other diseases such as thyroid disease, coeliac and systemic sclerosis.  The raised IgM and finding of antimitochondrial autoantibodies is the key to making the diagnosis and antimitochondrial antibodies have a high specificity and rules out the other diagnoses. Ursodeoxycholic acid at high doses is thought to slow progression.  Colestyramine is useful for pruritus as this can be severe.  If this fails then rifampicin or naltrexone may be considered.  Liver transplantation is used in end stage liver disease or severe intractable pruritus."
gastrointestinal system,387,Which of the following is a histological finding on duodenal biopsy in the diagnosis of coeliac disease?,Absence of epithelial apoptosis,Absence of fissures,Crypt hyperplasia,Reduced intraepithelial lymphocytes,Villous hypertrophy,C,"The diagnosis of coeliac disease is established when there is concordance between the serology and histological findings. It is confirmed when symptoms resolve subsequently on a gluten-free diet. However, demonstration of normalisation of histology is not always required and many patients show persistent villous atrophy despite adherence to a gluten-free diet and improvement in symptoms. Patients with positive coeliac serology and those with a high probability of coeliac disease (greater than5%) regardless of the serology should have an upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies for confirmation of the diagnosis. On histology the duodenal mucosa may:  appear atrophic with loss of folds contain visible fissures have a nodular appearance, or have scalloped folds.  Histological features range from mild changes such as only increased intraepithelial lymphocytes, to a flat mucosa with total mucosal atrophy, complete loss of villi, enhanced epithelial apoptosis, and crypt hyperplasia.

gastrointestinal system,388,Which of the following is correct regarding gastric adenocarcinoma?,Has a five year survival of 60%,Is more common in patients with blood group A,Is not associated with H. pylori infection,Occurs in the body and fundus in the majority of patients,Trosier's sign is the presence of an involved right supraclavicular lymph node,B,"It is associated with blood group A. H. pylori is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma. The tumour is located in the pylorus and antrum in 50-60% of patients, the cardia in 25% of patients and the remainder are in the body and fundus. Trosier's sign is the presence of an enlarged left supraclavicular node (Virchow's node). The majority of gastric cancers are detected at an advanced stage in the United Kingdom and the five year survival is 5-10%."
gastrointestinal system,389,A 65-year-old man has sudden onset of tearing back pain believed by the general practitioner to be renal colic. This is his first episode of such pain. His medical history includes hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia. He is a smoker of 30 cigarettes a day. Dipstick testing of his urine is normal. On assessment in the Emergency Department his pulse is 82 beats per minute and blood pressure of 138/90 mmHg. He is given analgesia and is sent to the urology ward for clerking. Before he is assessed he becomes acutely unwell with a blood pressure of 106/68 mmHg and a pulse of 120 beats per minute. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute pancreatitis,Perforated duodenal ulcer,Pyelonephritis,Renal colic,Ruptured aortic aneurysm,E,"This is a classic scenario and emphasises the importance of obtaining an accurate history. The presence of an aneurysm must be excluded in any patient who presents with back pain. In this case, there is a strong cardiovascular history which, along with male gender, is typical of that of a patient with an aortic aneurysm. Furthermore, the nature of the pain and absence of haematuria tends to count against renal colic. The other classic mimic for aortic aneurysm is lower abdominal pain radiating to the testicle."
gastrointestinal system,390,What is the approximate incidence of forming pigment gallstones in patients with sickle cell disease?,20%,30%,50%,80%,90%,C,Patients with haemolytic disorders such as sickle cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis have an approximately 50% incidence of forming pigment gallstones. Black pigment gallstones are common in sickle cell disease and are due to an increase in bilirubin excretion. Their small size allows migration into the common bile duct causing low-grade obstruction typically leading to hyperbilirubinaemia rather than bile duct dilatation. In view of the high incidence of gallstones with such conditions cholecystectomy is suggested for patients with sickle cell disease if abdominal surgery is being performed for other reasons. 
gastrointestinal system,391,"A 40-year-old single man returned from holiday in Europe with mild bloody diarrhoea which had lasted for two weeks. He had lost 2.5 kg in weight, had occasional lower abdominal cramping discomfort and a painful swelling of his left knee. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Amoebiasis,Campylobacter infection,Crohn's disease,Gonococcal septicaemia,Ulcerative colitis,B,"Campylobacter infection is one of the commonest causes of inflammatory diarrhoea. Abdominal pain is often a prominent feature of the illness frequently localising to the right iliac fossa. Diarrhoea may be mild or very severe often with passage of blood. Symptoms may last a week or longer. Reactive arthritis can develop following infection with a number of enteric pathogens including Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter and Yersinia. "
gastrointestinal system,392,A 24-year-old man is referred to you from the emergency department. When you attend the patient he is sitting forward holding his abdomen and complaining of severe epigastric pain. He has vomited on several occasions. On examination he has marked epigastric tenderness and an amylase returns as 2100 IU/L. You suspect acute pancreatitis. You phone the registrar who is in clinic and he asks for the Imrie/Glasgow score. Which of the following factors is not relevant to the score?,Albumin,Amylase,Lactate dehydrodgenase,Urea,White cell count,B,"Despite its importance in establishing the diagnosis, amylase is not part of the scoring system devised by Clement Imrie, a contemporary Glaswegian surgeon. The scoring system allots 1 point for each of the following:    PaO2 less than60 mmHg   Albumin less than32 g/L   Calcium less than2 mmol/L   WBC greater than15 ×10^9/L   AST/ALT greater than200 IU/L   LDH greater than600 IU/L   Glucose greater than10 mmol/L   Urea greater than16 mmol/L   Age greater than55    A score of 3 or more predicts a severe acute pancreatitis, although this is not synonymous with severe acute pancreatitis as this is defined as acute pancreatitis associated with organ failure and/or local complication such as necrosis (+/- infection), pseudocyst or abscess."
gastrointestinal system,393,A 42-year-old female with ulcerative colitis is found to have anti-smooth muscle antibodies. Which is the most appropriate next test for this patient?,Abdominal ultrasound,Colonoscopy,Full blood count,Liver biopsy,Liver function tests,E,"The most appropriate investigation for this woman is LFTs to begin with to assess if there are any features of autoimmune hepatitis, such as, raised bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase. If this is the case then liver biopsy may be required or further diagnostic imaging. Autoimmune hepatitis is often seen in individuals with other autoimmune disorders such as ulcerative colitis."
gastrointestinal system,394,A 31-years-old male teacher attends clinic with his partner who tells you that he has memory problems. The only other symptom is intermittent diarrhoea over the preceding four months. He has limited vertical eye movements and exhibits rhythmic simultaneous eye and mouth movements. Which pathogen is most likely to be the cause of his symptoms?,Clostridium botulinum,HIV,Prion protein,Salmonella enteritidis,Tropheryma whippleii,E,"This is a tough question. The suggestion here is that the patient has Whipple's disease, due to intestinal infection with Tropheryma whippleii. Non-neurological manifestations of Whipple's disease are more common and include chronic diarrhoea, malabsorption with steatorrhoea, and associated abdominal distension and tenderness. Neurological manifestations involve a chronic progressive impairment of higher mental function in association with seizures, myoclonus ataxia and oculomasticatory myorhythmia, found uniquely in Whipple's. The diagnosis is made by duodenal or jejunal biopsy and demonstrating the bacilli within the mucosa on PAS staining. Characteristically, there is accumulation of glycoprotein and fat filled (PAS +ve) macrophage within the lamina propria. Botulism does not produce this clinical picture. An AIDS-related dementia is possible, but abnormal facial movements would be unusual. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) could also produce this picture, although myoclonus is usually more of a feature and cognitive impairment is more generalised and acute. Salmonella enteritidis usually causes only an acute diarrhoeal illness but may lead to bacteraemia and chronic long-term carriage and excretion."
gastrointestinal system,395,"A 45-year-old woman has had severe epigastric and right hypochondrial pain for a few hours. She has a normal CBC, serum ALP is raised, normal transaminase. 3 months ago she had a cholecystectomy done. What is the most appropriate investigation?",US abdomen,ERCP,MRCP,CT abdomen,Upper GI endoscopy,C,"Post operative US of abdomen does not give good result for hepatobiliary system. ERCP is invasive procedure and it has its considerable complications like cholangitis, injury, pancreatitis etc. Among given options MRCP is most appropriate. We shall go for ERCP after making the diagnosis confirm. For this MRCP is preferred"
gastrointestinal system,396,"A 71-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with acute severe abdominal pain and diarrhoea. He describes the pain as a dull ache across his abdomen. He apparently underwent a bowel resection some four months earlier, and he has a history of ischaemic heart disease and two previous myocardial infarctions. He reports intermittent abdominal pain leading up to this latest event, which seemed to be worse if he had eaten a heavy meal. On examination his BP is 100/55 mmHg, his pulse is 105 in atrial fibrillation (AF). His abdomen is generally tender, with sparse bowel sounds. Investigations show:    Hb 110 g/L (135-180)   WCC 14.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   PLT 207 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 139 mmol/L (135-146)   K 5.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Cr 172 μmol/L (79-118)   Amylase 450 U/L (60-180)   Lactate 4.2 mmol/L (0.5-2.2)    A plain abdominal film is unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute pancreatitis,Inflammatory colitis,Irritable bowel syndrome,Mesenteric ischaemia,Small bowel obstruction,D,"The history of ischaemic heart disease and presence of AF is suspicious for mesenteric ischaemia. Abdominal pain in the presence of a relatively normal x ray, diarrhoea, and a raised serum lactate add significantly to the suspicion. CT scanning has become the imaging modality of choice for confirming the diagnosis, with a sensitivity and specificity for mesenteric ischaemia of over 90%. Angiography is still used where the diagnosis is in doubt."
gastrointestinal system,397,Which of the following dermatological conditions is associated with oesophageal carcinoma?,Acanthosis nigricans,Ichthyosis,Necrolytic migratory erythema,Tylosis,Vasculitis,D,Acanthosis nigricans is associated with gastric adenocarcinoma. Ichthyosis is associated with lymphoma. Glucagonoma is associated with necrolytic migratory erythema. Malignancy-associated vasculitis is associated with haematological rather than solid malignancies.
gastrointestinal system,398,A 35-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis is admitted with deteriorating encephalopathy and abdominal discomfort. An ascitic tap revealed a polymorphonuclear cell count of 350 cells per mm^3. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy?,Intravenous amoxicillin,Intravenous cefotaxime,Intravenous metronidazole,Oral neomycin,Oral norfloxacin,B,"This lady has spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as suggested by the typical history, ascites and raised polymorphonuclear count within the ascitic tap. It is most commonly seen in alcoholic cirrhosis and the causative organisms are usually Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, S. pneumoniae or Enterococci. (Compare this with the mixed growth seen in other forms of peritonitis). Sending some ascitic fluid in blood culture bottles increases the yield. Initial treatment is with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as cefotaxime. Norfloxacin is recommended for short-term prophylaxis."
gastrointestinal system,399,Which of the following is correct regarding oesophagus pain?,Is not associated with acid reflux,May be exacerbated by respiration,Radiates to the upper abdomen,Responds to GTN,Usually radiates to the back,D,Oesophageal spasm can be particularly difficult to distinguish from angina pectoris. Reflux often presents with oesophageal spasm and pain. Spasm may be relieved by GTN making the differential diagnosis more difficult. It usually is substernal to the throat but may radiate to the back.
gastrointestinal system,400,"A 37-year-old woman gives an eight-month history of bloody diarrhoea. On average she has six bowel motions per day with associated urgency. She also reports weight loss of approximately 3 kg. On examination, she is dehydrated and tachycardic. There is evidence of pallor and abdominal examination reveals left-sided tenderness. Which of the following pathological features would you expect to find given the likely underlying diagnosis?",Diffuse mucosal inflammation,Lymphoid aggregates,Normal crypt architecture,Presence of goblet cells,Transmural inflammation,A,"Chronic (particularly for this duration) bloody diarrhoea in a young patient is very suggestive of a diagnosis of ulcerative colitis. The time course is too long for an infective cause and whilst Crohn's may cause a colitis, this is less frequent. Bloody diarrhoea occurs in 90-100% of cases of UC. Crohn's disease often presents with intermittent abdominal pain, diarrhoea is usually watery and in half of all cases, presentation is with perianal disease. Bloody diarrhoea may be a feature of Crohn's colitis but this is less common than UC. The predominant left sided symptoms (urgency and anatomical distribution of the tendency) should also point towards UC. The answer here, therefore, is diffuse mucosal inflammation, all the remaining options are histological features of Crohn's disease. Mucosal inflammation is one of the histological findings in UC; transmural inflammation is seen in Crohn's disease. Lymphocytes are seen in Crohn's disease, whereas neutrophils are found in UC. Crypt abscesses and goblet cell depletion are also found in UC. "
gastrointestinal system,401,A 60 year old gentleman presents to his GP with tiredness and increased shortness of breath. Bloods reveal a microcytic hypochromic anaemia and he is subsequently found to have iron deficiency anaemia. There is no evidence of any GI symptoms. What investigation s most appropriate to organise in this case?,Colonoscopy,CT Chest Abdomen and Pelvis,Flexible Sigmoidoscopy,Recheck bloods in three months time after iron supplementation,Upper GI endoscopy,A,A colonoscopy should be performed in this case as lower GI pathology is more likely to be malignant than upper GI pathology which is often oesophagitis or other benign conditions are found. Upper GI malignancy also has a lower incidence than lower GI malignancy. Obviously if there is any upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia or dysphagia then an upper GI endoscopy should be performed in the first instance.
gastrointestinal system,402,Which of the following is an inhibitor of gastric acid secretion?,Acetylcholine,Histamine,Prostaglandins,Stomach distension,Swallowing,C,The correct answer is prostaglandins. The remaining listed options all stimulate the release of gastric acid.
gastrointestinal system,403,A woman had lunch at a Chinese restaurant. In the evening she presented with diarrhoea and vomiting. There was no fever. Which of the following is the likely cause of food poisoning in her case?,Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens,Escherichia coli,Staphylococcus aureus,Yersinia enterocolitica,A,"Bacillus cereus food poisoning is the general description, although two recognised types of illness are caused by two distinct metabolites.  The diarrhoeal type of illness is caused by a large molecular weight protein while The vomiting (emetic) type of illness is believed to be caused by a low molecular weight, heat-stable peptide.  The onset of watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramps and pain occurs 6-15 hours after consumption of contaminated food. Symptoms usually persist for 24 hours. The emetic type of food poisoning is characterised by nausea and vomiting within 0.5 to 6 hours after consumption of contaminated foods. Occasionally, abdominal cramps and/or diarrhoea may also occur. Duration of symptoms is generally less than 24 hours. A wide variety of foods including meats, milk, vegetables, and fish have been associated with the diarrhoeal type food poisoning. The vomiting-type outbreaks have generally been associated with rice products. Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens are associated with meat and Yersinia enterocolitica with milk."
gastrointestinal system,404,A 55 year old gentleman was discharged one week ago following treatment for neutropenic sepsis. He has been having chemotherapy for colorectal carcinoma. He now presents with watery diarrhoea although he has had some blood stained stools and abdominal cramps. He looks unwell and is hypotensive and tachycardic. He has generalised abdominal tenderness although there is no evidence of peritonism. Bloods reveal an elevated CRP and normal WCC. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Diverticulitis,Inflammatory bowel disease,Gastroenteritis,Pseudomembranous Colitis,Tumour related,D,"This patient has had a recent course of antibiotics, is immunosuppressed and has recently had chemotherapy which makes him high risk for the development of pseudomembranous colitis secondary to clostridium difficle infection. As he is immunosuppressed this accounts for the normal WCC which normally is markedly elevated in pseudomembranous colitis. Symptoms due to the tumour are unlikely. Diverticulitis may lead to these symptoms however the history is more in keeping with C. difficle. Gastroenteritis again can lead to similar symptoms however again the history should raise the suspicion of pseudomembranous colitis."
gastrointestinal system,405,What is the most likely cause of a Mallory Weiss tear?,Candidiasis,Coughing,Alcohol,Persistently vomiting,Barretts oesophagus,D,Mallory Weiss is caused by vomiting. Although alcohol is not the direct cause it is often associated with Mallory Weiss tears due to binge drinking leading to excessive vomiting.
gastrointestinal system,406,"A 70-year-old man is admitted with pruritus and jaundice of two weeks duration and 2 kg weight loss over the last 2 years. He has not drunk any alcohol for at least eight years. One month ago, he completed a course of co-amoxiclav which had been prescribed by his GP for sinusitis and he was also taking ibuprofen for hip osteoarthritis. Investigations reveal:    Albumin 38 g/L (37-49)   Bilirubin 200 μmol/L (1-22)   AST 150 U/L (5-35)   Alkaline phosphatase 200 U/L (45-105)    Abdominal ultrasound reveals gallstones but no biliary duct dilatation. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his jaundice?",Cholangio-carcinoma,Co-amoxiclav,Hepatitis B infection,Hepatitis C infection,Ibuprofen,B,"Co-amoxiclav (Augmentin) is notorious for causing drug-induced jaundice, often with a mixed hepatitic/cholestatic picture. A four-week delay in symptoms and signs is not unusual. Flucloxacillin is another common culprit. The patient must be warned that this could reoccur if he is given co-amoxiclav again. There is nothing in the history (risk factors) to suggest that this might be acute hepatitis B infection and there is no evidence of chronic liver disease to suggest that this might be a result of chronic viral hepatitis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen and diclofenac, may cause drug-induced hepatitis, however, the pattern of abnormality if a transaminitis and hyperbilirubinaemia is not usually seen. Cholangiocarcinoma may present with an obstructive jaundice and weight loss, however, it is a relatively rare condition in those without risk factors for the disease and in a case such as this, whilst ultrasound may not demonstrate the actual lesion, one would expect it to show evidence of biliary duct obstruction and more likely than not evidence of hepatic metastases."
gastrointestinal system,407,A 78-year-old male who presents with increasing dysphagia is diagnosed with an inoperable carcinoma of the distal oesophagus. Oesophageal spasm causes food to stick after swallowing which causes odynophagia. Which drug would be most helpful in relieving his chronic pain?,Clodronate,Dexamethasone,Nifedipine,Oxybutynin,Pinaverium,C,Nifedipine helps relieve painful oesophageal spasm and tenesmus associated with gastrointestinal tumours and could be used to relieve his odynophagia. Clodronate inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and is used to treat malignant bone pain and the associated hypercalcaemia. Pinaverium is used to reduce the pain duration associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Corticosteroids are used to treat pain from central nervous system tumours and painful bladder spasm may be relieved by oxybutynin.
gastrointestinal system,408,"A 75-year-old patient presents with watery diarrhoea. He is passing large volumes of watery diarrhoea, approximately 3 litres a day, with no noticeable blood. It has been present for approximately five months and is gradually becoming more frequent. It often wakes him at night with the urge to defecate. Liver function tests, calcium and urea and electrolytes are normal. Stool microscopy and culture are normal, and Clostridium difficile toxin is negative. A flexible sigmoidoscopy is organised and the investigator reports to you that the large bowel appears normal. Biopsies demonstrate mild thickening of the subepithelial collagen band with 10 intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells. Crypt architecture is normal without evidence of cryptitis. From which of the following treatments may this patient benefit?",Gluten free diet,Low residue diet,Oral budesonide,Oral cholestyramine,Oral prednisolone,C,"In the absence of infection and with this typical history in an elderly individual, the diagnosis is likely to be microscopic colitis. This does not fulfil the ROME II criteria for IBS. Although coeliac disease is a possibility, this is unlikely given the patient's age and the presentation. Microscopic colitis can only be diagnosed by colonoscopy and mucosal biopsy because, macroscopically, the colon appears normal. The incidence is increasing as the use of colonoscopy increases; almost certainly due to better diagnostic workup. Microscopic colitis is diagnosed in up to 10% of all patients undergoing colonoscopy for unexplained diarrhoea, an incidence which increases to 20% in those aged over 70 years. Budesonide is the most effective and widely studied agent for inducing (and maintaining) remission in microscopic colitis. It is likely to be more effective (and certainly less toxic) than oral prednisolone. There are conflicting data on the association between bile acid malabsorption (BAM) and microscopic colitis though more data support an association. Where present BAM (unsurprisingly) worsens diarrhoea. Cholestyramine is recommended where there is BAM however, there is evidence that even patients without BAM may respond to cholestyramine therapy. Use of 5-ASA compounds, with or without cholestyramine has generated high remission rates (85-91%). Most treatment algorithms suggest a graded approach starting with antidiarrhoeal agents, cholestyramine and 5-ASAs. More severe (such as here) or non-responsive disease should be treated with budesonide in the first instance and bismuth in the second."
gastrointestinal system,409,"A 20 year old presents with diarrhoea. This has been ongoing for several months and she has intermittent crampy abdominal pain and feels bloated. She has noticed ulcers in her mouth and has been generally unwell and feeling tired. Her bloods reveal a macrocytic anaemia. A colonoscopy is performed and shows multiple ulcerative areas and a barium follow through shows severe small bowel disease. You suspect this young woman has Crohns Disease, which of the following is the biggest risk factor for developing this disease?",Poor diet,Smoking,Coeliac disease,Oral contraceptive,Non smoker,D,The biggest risk factor from the list is the oral contraceptive. Smoking is also thought to be a risk factor.
gastrointestinal system,410,Retroperitoneal fibrosis is most likely to be associated with which of the following?,Abdominal aortic aneurysm,Diabetes mellitus,Hashimoto's thyroiditis,Inferior vena cava thrombosis,Perthes' disease,A,"Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF) is a rare disorder associated with dense fibrosis, producing oedema and biliary and occasionally ureteric obstruction. Idiopathic RPF normally affects men in their fifth or sixth decade of life. It is associated with:  Methysergide maleate (migraine medication) Riedel's thyroiditis Peyronie's disease Abdominal aortic aneurysm, and Malignancy.  Longstanding infections of the urinary tract, especially with extravasation, can lead to RPF."
gastrointestinal system,411,"A 21-year-old anorexic is admitted for parenteral nutrition and has a tunnelled line inserted. A few days after parenteral feeding has begun you are asked to see her as she has begun complaining of diplopia, lethargy and muscle weakness. She also has paraesthesia affecting her hands and feet. Examination confirms global muscle weakness and peripheral sensory loss. Which of the following electrolyte abnormalities is the most likely to have occurred?",Hyperkalaemia,Hypermagnesaemia,Hyperphosphataemia,Hypocalcaemia,Hypophosphataemia,E,"This patient is suffering from re-feeding syndrome, where patients complain of a range of symptoms which can include:  muscle weakness peripheral neuropathy neurological impairment, and  myocardial depression.  It is characterised by a fall in phosphate, magnesium, potassium and fluid accumulation, which in combination can lead to cardiac failure. Patients at risk from re-feeding include those who are fed after a prolonged period of starvation, such as those with anorexia and those with chronic alcoholism. The key to avoiding re-feeding syndrome and hypophosphataemia is involvement of a specialist dietician who will be able to advise on adequate phosphate replacement during the initial stages of re-feeding."
gastrointestinal system,412,"A 47-year-old male presents with shortness of breath. He has cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C infection. He gives a chronic history of progressive shortness of breath on exertion and now becomes short of breath walking up steps. He gives a history of being more short of breath whilst sitting up, preferring to sleep with no pillows. The blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg, heart rate 85 beats per minute, and pulse oximetry, breathing room air, shows saturations of 95% lying flat and 87% sitting up. Which of the following tests is the most appropriate to confirm the diagnosis?",Contrast echocardiography,High resolution CT chest,MRI chest,Pulmonary angiography,V:Q scan,A,"This patient has hepatopulmonary syndrome. This is characterised by an oxygenation defect induced by pulmonary vascular dilatation in patients with liver cirrhosis or portal hypertension. This oxygenation defect consists of a wide alveolar-arterial gradient (greater than15 mmHg). The vascular dilatation is thought to be induced by increased pulmonary levels of nitric oxide. It is seen in 15-30% of patients with cirrhosis and is a poor prognostic indicator. Most patients with hepatopulmonary syndrome are asymptomatic or have dyspnoea with an insidious onset. Dyspnoea whilst standing (platypnoea) and hypoxaemia exacerbated by being upright (orthodeoxia) are characteristic and are thought to be due to the predominance of vascular dilatation in the lung bases. Blood flow to these areas is increased in the upright position. Desaturation during sleep is also often seen, as are clubbing and cyanosis. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography is the best test to demonstrate intrapulmonary vascular dilatation. It can also exclude intracardiac shunting which may result in similar signs and symptoms to hepatopulmonary syndrome. This is performed by injecting agitated saline intravenously during transthoracic echocardiography. In a normal subject, microbubbles are visualised in the right ventricle within seconds, which are then absorbed in the alveoli. Immediate visualisation in the left ventricle (within three cardiac cycles) indicates intracardiac shunting. Delayed visualisation in the left ventricle (3-6 cardiac cycles) is diagnostic of intrapulmonary shunting. Radionuclide lung perfusion scanning can also be used. Chest radiographs can be normal or show non-specific interstitial changes. ABGs should be taken in the sitting position to grade the severity of the condition based on the degree of hypoxaemia. Liver transplantation is the only proven beneficial available treatment, with 85% of patients showing resolution or significant improvement in gas exchange postoperatively. "
gastrointestinal system,413,A 50 year old gentleman with ischaemic heart disease who is on aspirin presents with haematemesis.  What is the most likely reason for his haematemesis?,Duodenal ulcer,Gastric erosions,Angiodysplastic Lesion,Gastritis,Oesophageal varices,B,Aspirin is most likely to have caused gastric erosions and this is the most likely cause for the haematemesis. The other options could be the cause and therefore an upper GI endoscopy should be arranged.
gastrointestinal system,414,"A 26 year old female presents with fatigue, myalgia and pruritus.  She is complaining of vague right upper quadrant pain and has noticed her skin and eyes appearing yellow in colour.  On examination there is evidence of hepatomegaly and jaundice. Bloods reveal deranged LFTs (predominantly raised aminotransferases), a normocytic anaemia, elevated IgGs and anti LKM antibodies.  Given the most likely diagnosis steroids are commenced however the patient is concerned regarding the side effects of steroids.  What agent is used first line as a steroid sparing agent?",Budesonide,Methotrexate,Ciclosporin,Ursodeoxycholic acid,Azathioprine,E,"The most likely diagnosis is autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease where there is hepatocellular inflammation and necrosis which can lead onto to cirrhosis. It typically presents as in this case and type 2 autoimmune hepatitis tends to effect younger individuals and children and is associated with LKM1 autoantibodies.  In type 2 there is often other autoimmune diseases associated such as inflammatory bowel disease, ITP, graves disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and many more.  In type 1 autoimmune hepatitis there is ANA, anti smooth muscle antibodies and raised IgG.  It is less often associated with other disease.  Liver biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis and staging.  The mainstay of the management of AIH is corticosteroids with or without azathioprine.  Ciclosporin and the other options may also be consider if these fail.  Liver transplantation may ultimately be required and prognosis is good."
gastrointestinal system,415,A patient with ulcerative colitis is found to have deranged LFTs with particularly elevated bilirubin and gamma glutamyltransferase.  He is complaining of pruritus.  On examination he appears jaundice and there is hepatomegaly.  Bloods reveal positive ANCA.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Non alcohol steatohepatitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Alcohol related liver disease,Autoimmune hepatitis,C,Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic disorder characterised by inflammation an fibrosis of intra and extrahepatic ducts.  In over 75% of cases of PSC is there associated inflammatory bowel disease usually ulcerative colitis.  It typically presents as above or is found incidentally.  It is associated with ANCA in about 60% of cases and is thought to indicate a more severe course.  In PBC and AIH you would expect other autoantibodies to be elevated.  Ultrasound may show dilated intra and extra hepatic ducts however MRCP and ERCP if intervention is planned is useful for the diagnosis.  MRCP is being more frequently used as it is non invasive compared to ERCP. Ursodeoxycholic acid is utilised in the management and improves cholestasis.  Balloon dilatation and stent insertion may be required to relieve symptoms. Liver transplantation is required when there is significant cirrhosis. The biggest concern is the development of cholangiocarcinoma and it is thought that alcohol consumption may exacerbate this risk.
gastrointestinal system,416,A 52 year old female presents with fatigue. She has also noticed being very itchy and the whites of her eyes becoming yellow. She has deranged LFTs and her anti mitochondrial antibody is positive. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Haemochromatosis,Primary sclerosing cholangitis,Autoimmune hepatitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Wilsons disease,D,PBC is the most likely diagnosis given the history and anti mitochondrial antibodies confirm the diagnosis.
gastrointestinal system,417,Which of the following is true concerning intussusception in childhood?,"Has, as the earliest sign, the passage of redcurrant jelly stools",Has a peak incidence in the first two months of life,Is often accompanied by enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes,Is characterised by lethargy,May be caused by a Rotavirus infection,C,"Intussusception is a condition associated with the prolapse of one part of the bowel into an adjacent region. It is most common in children 3-12 months, more frequently in males (3:1) and although most cases are idiopathic, conditions such as intestinal lymphadenopathy (adenovirus) may predispose. Symptoms include:  paroxysms of abdominal pain with pallor vomiting, and loose watery stools (initially).  Later, redcurrant jelly stools occur. "
gastrointestinal system,418,What is the most common presenting symptom of small bowel lymphoma?,Bleeding,Constipation,Loss of appetite,Pain,Weight loss,D,"Pain is the most common presenting feature of small bowel lymphoma the pathogenesis of which is poorly understood. Lymphoma comprises 15-20% of all small bowel tumours with the ileum most commonly affected. Primary lymphomas of the small bowel include:  mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma diffuse large B cell lymphoma immunoproliferative small intestinal disease (IPSID), and enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL).  Patients with coeliac disease are at higher risk of T cell lymphoma. There is a male predominance and the median age at presentation of 25 years. Patients with primary gastrointestinal tract lymphoma may present with:  anorexia weight loss nausea and vomiting chronic pain abdominal fullness early satiety, and constipation.  There may even be symptoms of obstruction, perforation or haemorrhage. Findings on CT vary and may include multiple tumours, narrowing of the bowel lumen and mesenteric nodal masses. "
gastrointestinal system,419,A 45-year-old man presents with a three day history of perianal pain which is getting worse. On examination he has a large perinal abscess. Which is correct regarding perianal abscess?,Are more common in ulcerative colitis than in Crohn's disease,Are relatively common in children,Has an incidence of 5% in the diabetic population,Position is predicted by Goodsall's rule,With the presence of aerobic bacteria in the pus implies a fistula,C,"Goodsall's rule predicts the position of the internal opening of a perianal fistula. The presence of bowel flora is associated with a fistula, aerobic bacteria would imply that the sepsis was derived from the skin. The incidence is less than 0.1% with boys less than 2 years being affected more often. Crohn's patients present more often with perianal sepsis and that may be the presenting symptom. All patients presenting with a perianal abscess need to be screened for diabetes."
gastrointestinal system,420,"A 45-year-old woman presents with pruritus. On examination she has clubbing, palmar erythema and spider naevi. There is also evidence of excoriations and xanthelasma. Blood results demonstrate deranged liver function tests with a predominantly cholestatic picture but the abdominal ultrasound scan is normal. A subsequent autoimmune screen is positive for antimitochondrial antibodies. Given the likely diagnosis, which of the following HLA antigens is associated with this disease?",HLA-A3,HLA-B5,HLA-B27,HLA-B35,HLA-DR8,E,This woman has primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) which is associated with HLA-DR8. Antimitochondrial antibodies are positive in 95% of cases of PBC. HLA-A3 is associated with haemochromatosis. HLA-B5 is associated with Behcet's disease. Subacute thyroiditis has an association with HLA-B35. Ankylosing spondylitis is associated with HLA-B27. 
gastrointestinal system,421,A child with increasing jaundice and pale stools. Choose the appropriate test:,Endomyseal antibodies,Sweat test,TFT,LFT,US,E,This is obstructive jaundice where US may show dilatation of common bile duct or stones
gastrointestinal system,422,On examination of a 47-year-old female's abdomen she is found to have clinical splenomegally. Which of the following conditions is associated with splenomegaly?,Budd-Chiari syndrome,Congestive cardiac failure,Metastatic colonic carcinoma,Mitral stenosis,Pernicious anaemia,A,Hepatic vein thrombosis/Budd-Chiari results in portal hypertension and splenomegaly. Colonic carcinoma is not associated with splenomegaly. Other causes include infections such as infectious mononucleosis and lymphoma. Splenomegaly is not a feature of congestive cardiac failure.
gastrointestinal system,423,"A 40-year-old woman has presented with an episode of acute pancreatitis. Following assessment she is found to have a modified Glasgow score of 2. Ultrasound imaging confirms multiple gallstones within a thin-walled gallbladder, and a common bile duct with a maximal diameter of 10 mm with no choledochal lithiasis. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and sphincterotomy were performed the following day. Three days later her symptoms have resolved. What would be the next appropriate step?",Cholecystectomy during this admission,Cholecystectomy in one month's time,Cholecystectomy,CT scan,MRCP,A,"The British Society of Gastroenterology recommend that all patients with a biliary cause for pancreatitis undergo definitive gallstone management, either on the acute admission or planned within two weeks if the patient is sent home.

What is the single investigation most likely to lead to diagnosis?,Colonoscopy,Endomysial antibodies,Fasting serum glucose conc,TFT,US abdomen,A,"Probable diagnosis is diverticulitis and preferred investigation from given list is colonoscopy. Colonoscopy: It views the colon's interior to see the inflamed, infected pouches. Ultrasound images lack the detail of CT images and cannot evaluate the intestines as well as CT"
gastrointestinal system,425,A 50 year old male presents with weight gain mainly around the face and trunk.  He has also noticed his arms and legs feeling weak especially when trying to get up from a seat.  He has noticed he is easily bruising and there is evidence of striae.  He is found to be hypertensive and hypokalaemic.  Which investigation should be performed initially?,24 hour free urinary cortisol,CT Head and abdomen,High dose dexamethasone,Urinary Catecholamines,ACTH measurement,A,This patient is likely to have Cushings syndrome and thus 24 hour urinary cortisol measurement (usually at least 2) and low dose dexamethasone should be performed in the first instance to confirm this is the case. Low dose dexamtheasone test is useful in those who cannot collect urine for 24 hours or if there is some dubity.  High dose dexamethasone and ACTH measurement provide further information about the likely underlying cause as in whether is is ACTH dependent or independent.  If it is thought to be ACTH independent then an adrenal gland CT scan is useful.  If not an MRI of the pituitary should be performed to assess if there is an adenoma and thus Cushings disease.
gastrointestinal system,426,"A 42-year-old man presents with a six-month history of diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. On further questioning, it appears he has also noticed facial flushing. On examination, there is wheeze on auscultation of his chest and abdominal examination reveals hepatomegaly. Which of the following investigations would confirm the likely diagnosis?",24-hour urinary 5-HIAA,24-hour urinary copper,24-hour urinary free cortisol,24-hour urinary protein,24-hour urinary VMA,A,"This patient has carcinoid syndrome. The diagnosis is made by 24-hour urine collection for 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) - excretion is greater than 0.3 mmol. Forty-five percent of carcinoid tumours arise in the appendix, 30% arise in the small bowel, and 20% in the rectum. Most patients with carcinoid syndrome have liver metastases. 5-HT, kinins, prostaglandins and other vasoactive substances are secreted. Clinical features of carcinoid syndrome include diarrhoea and abdominal cramps in the majority of patients. Flushing, which is often provoked by alcohol, is also a feature, as are bronchoconstriction and cardiac involvement with tricuspid or pulmonary incompetence.  Diagnosis also includes chest x ray, abdominal ultrasound scan, small bowel radiology, and echocardiography to establish the extent of disease. Surgical resection of the primary tumour is possible in some cases; octreotide is the treatment of choice. In the majority of cases of Wilson's disease, 24-hour urinary copper is greater than 3 μmol. In Cushing's syndrome, 24-hour urinary free cortisol is elevated. Nephrotic syndrome is defined as proteinuria greater than 3.5 g/1.75 m^2 of body surface per 24 hours, hypoalbuminaemia, and oedema. Screening for phaeochromocytoma can be performed by 24-hour urine collection for 4-OH-3-methoxymandelate (HMMA, VMA). "
gastrointestinal system,427,"A 64-year-old male was admitted to the medical ward with complaint of diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss for few months. Examination: clubbing, perianal skin tags and abdominal tenderness. Colonscopy reveals transmural granulomatous inflammation involving ileocecal junction. He was diagnosed with what?",CD (Crohn’s disease),UC (ulcerative colitis),Bowel cancer,Gastric cancer,IBD (irritable bowel syndrome),A,"Diagnosis is Crohn’s disease. Crohn's disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that may affect any segment of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth to the anus. Symptoms often include abdominal pain, diarrhea (which may be bloody if inflammation is severe), fever, and weight loss. Clubbing, perianal skin tags and aphthous ulcers can also may be seen. Transmural granulomatous inflammation on colonoscopy is diagnostic of Crohn’s disease"
gastrointestinal system,428,A 45-year-old male presents with severe epigastric pain and is diagnosed with acute pancreatitis. Which one of the following is correct?,A necrotic pancreas is an indication for early surgery,A poor prognosis may be indicated by a serum urea greater than10 mmol/L,A 'sentinel loop' may be visible on the abdominal x ray,Acute pancreatitis may be associated with hypoglycaemia,The serum calcium is usually high,C,"Acute pancreatitis is an autodigestive process which is commonly associated with biliary tract disease or excessive alcohol intake. Other recognised causes include:  Abdominal trauma Mumps Hypothermia Diuretic, and Steroid therapy.  The classical laboratory findings include:  A raised serum amylase Leucocytosis Hyperglycaemia Hypocalcaemia Hypoproteinaemia, and Hyperlipidaemia.  An abdominal x ray may reveal a 'sentinel loop' of small bowel overlying the pancreas. The chest x ray can show a wide range of pathology. Poor prognosis may be indicated by:  Age greater than55 years Systolic blood pressure less than90 mmHg A white cell count greater than15 ×10^9/L Temperature greater than39°C Glucose greater than10 mmol/L PaO2 less than8 kPa Urea greater than15 mmol/L Calcium less than2 mmol/L Haematocrit reduced by over 0.1 Abnormal liver function tests.  Surgery may be required for drainage of an abscess or pseudocyst but the resection of a necrotic pancreas early in the disease has a high mortality."
gastrointestinal system,429,Which of the following is a characteristic feature of right sided colon cancer?,B12 deficiency anaemia,Intestinal obstruction,Mass in the left iliac fossa,PR bleeding,Weight loss,E,"Iron deficiency anaemia is a common feature of colonic neoplasia particularly caecal lesions which may be clinically apparent as a mass in the right iliac fossa. PR bleeding is more suggestive of left sided lesions, as is obstruction. Weight loss is another presenting feature."
gastrointestinal system,430,A 35 year old female has had previous bowel resection and currently has an ileostomy. She comes to clinic complaining of a lesion around her stoma. On examination there is evidence of an ulcerated lesion which is purple in colour and is at the end of her stoma. It extends from the stoma into the surrounding skin. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Dermatitis,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Crohns,Herniation of stoma,Bullous pemphigoid,B,Pyoderma gangrenosum is the most likely diagnosis in this case. It is associated with inflammatory bowel disease and although it commonly occurs on the legs it has been found to occur at the stoma site.
gastrointestinal system,431,"A 38-year-old woman presents with right upper quadrant pain, one week following elective cholecystectomy. Abdominal ultrasound shows a small subphrenic abcess with no other significant problems noted. Which of the following is correct regarding subphrenic abscesses?",Are commonly associated with hiccups,Are commonly asymptomatic,Are associated with lung consolidations,Cause splenomegaly,Require laparotomy and thorough peritoneal lavage,A,"Subphrenic abscesses are associated with a swinging fever and marked toxaemia. Hiccups are common and are usually distressing. The liver is usually pushed down by the diaphragm and is therefore palpable. They are not associated with splenomegaly. On chest x ray pleural effusions are commonly seen as well as air in the subphrenic space, and occasionally an air-fluid level. Most subphrenic abscesses can be treated with ultrasound guided drainage and systemic antibiotics."
gastrointestinal system,432,Which of the following is not true of a patient with ascites due to liver cirrhosis?,Cardiac output is often elevated,Hepatic intrasinusoidal pressure is elevated,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is a recognised feature,The usual source of the ascitic fluid is mainly from the exudation from the surface of the liver,Urinary sodium concentration is usually less than 10 mmol/l,D,Hepatocellular failure is associated with hyperdynamic circulation and systemic vasodilatation with increased vascular capacitance. Most patients have sodium and water retention.
gastrointestinal system,433,A 68-year-old man has had increasing dysphagia for solid food for 3 months and has lost 5 kgs in weight. What single investigation is most likely to lead to a definitive diagnosis?,Barium swallow,CXR,CT chest,Endoscopy and biopsy,Video-fluoroscopy,D,Likely cause is malignant stricture for which endoscopic biopsy is the definitive investigation
gastrointestinal system,434,A 50-year-old man complains of dysphagia after eating bread. Barium swallow reveals a lower esophageal ring. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Reassurance,Antispasmodics,Dilatation of the LES (lower oesophafeal sphincter),Endoscopic diverticulectomy,I&D (incision and drainage),C,Patients with recurrent symptoms from esophageal rings and webs require repeat esophageal dilation. Repeat esophageal dilation is safe and can relieve symptoms in the long term
gastrointestinal system,435,"A 65 year old gentleman who is normally fit and well presents to his GP with rectal bleeding. On further questioning he states he has lost some weight unintentionally and has noticed a change in bowel habit and tenesmus. On examination there is evidence of a left iliac fossa mass. A colonoscopy and biopsy confirm a colorectal adenocarcinoma. A CT is performed and the primary tumour is deemed resectable, however there is 3 small metastases within one of the lobes of the liver. There is no evidence of nodal disease. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient?",Resection of colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases,Resection of colorectal carcinoma and chemotherapy,Liver biopsy,Resection of colorectal carcinoma and radiotherapy for liver metastases,Chemotherapy,A,"According to guidelines patients who are able to have radical treatment of the primary tumour should be considered for liver resection. It is an MDT discussion and decision and usually requires that after resection there is at least one third of the liver, functioning. Liver biopsy must be discussed with specialists as there is evidence that percutaneous liver biopsies can lead to extrahepatic spread."
gastrointestinal system,436,A routine ultrasound at 18 weeks' gestation in a diabetic mother reveals a male fetus with an endocardial cushion defect. Other abnormalities include increased nuchal thickening and a 'double bubble' sign. Which of the following conditions is most likely to have contributed to this set of findings?,Congenital syphilis,Marfan's syndrome,Maternal folate deficiency,Maternal use of ACE inhibitor,Trisomy 21,E,"Diabetic mothers are more likely to have children with congenital abnormalities depending on preconception, and first-trimester blood sugar control. Forty percent of Down's syndrome babies have atrioventricular septal defects, as in this fetus. The double bubble sign suggests duodenal atresia, which again suggests Down's syndrome. Gastrointestinal (GI) malformations occur in 6% of Down's patients, most commonly duodenal atresia and Hirschsprung's disease."
gastrointestinal system,437,Which of the following is correct regarding congenital diaphragmatic hernia?,Is usually right sided,May be associated with hepatic hypoplasia,May be diagnosed antenatally,Repair is required within the first 48 hours,Repair is typically approached using a thoracic incision,C,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia occurs in 1 in 2000 live births and is frequently diagnosed on antenatal ultrasound scans. Left-sided (Bochdalek) defects are commonest, and pulmonary hypoplasia is a common cause of death. In babies, repair is usually delayed for at least 48 hours, until the ventilatory status is stable. It is repaired using a left upper quadrant abdominal incision."
gastrointestinal system,438,Which of the following can give a biochemical picture indistinguishable from extra-hepatic obstructive jaundice?,Erythromycin estolate,Halothane,Isoniazid,Lidocaine,Vancomycin,A,"Extra-hepatic jaundice would suggest a raised bilirubin with raised alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT). Cholestatic hepatitis, which is associated primarily with erythromycin estolate, can be caused by all forms of erythromycin Halothane and isoniazid may give rise to a hepatitic picture; raised aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) predominantly."
gastrointestinal system,439,"A 52-year-old man with a childhood diagnosis of coeliac disease had been asymptomatic despite poor dietary compliance. He presents with a one-month history of intermittent, colicky abdominal pain, 3 kilogram weight loss and the passage of altered blood per rectum. Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation?",Anti-endomysial antibody,Colonoscopy,CT scan of abdomen,Distal duodenal biopsy,Small bowel enema,B,"New-onset weight loss with rectal bleeding and abdominal pain in a 52-year-old man must be assumed to be colonic carcinoma until proven otherwise. Colonoscopy is the best way to check for this and would also demonstrate inflammatory bowel disease if present. A negative colonoscopy would prompt evaluation of the small bowel with CT or MR enterography given the history of coeliac disease, likely in combination with upper GI endoscopy. Small bowel malignancies, particularly lymphomas, are more common in those with coeliac disease and would be a potential consideration here. Risk is increased in those not adhering to a gluten-free diet (GFD) or with poor mucosal healing on a GFD. That said, they are still very rare and many (40-50%) are diagnosed simultaneously with coeliac disease."
gastrointestinal system,440,Which of the following is a contraindication to liver biopsy?,Platelets of 100,Extrahepatic biliary obstruction,BMI of 29,INR 1.3,Transaminases in 1000's,B,If a liver biopsy is performed in the presence of extrahepatic biliary obstruction there is risk of biliary peritonitis and septicaemia. Platelets of <60 and an INR of >1.4 are contraindications. Other contraindications include ascites (which must be treated first) and amyloidosis as there is risk of severe haemorrhage. Obesity and uncooperative patients are also contraindications.
gastrointestinal system,441,"In severe acute pancreatitis, supplemental parenteral nutrition should be provided if enteral feeding is not achieved within what period of time?",1 to 2 days,2 to 3 days,5 to 7 days,7 to 10 days,10 to 14 days,B,"To maintain gut barrier function and prevent early bacterial translocation, enteral feeding should ideally be started within the first 24 hours of admission. The presence of fluid collections in severe pancreatitis or raised pancreatic enzymes is not necessarily a contraindication to oral or enteral feeding. In a subgroup of patients there is correlation of pain, recurrence of disease, or worsening of fluid collections with feeding, whether oral or enteral. If the fluid collections are not suitable for drainage or if enteral feeding is not achieved within 48 to 72 hours, supplemental parenteral nutrition should be provided. "
gastrointestinal system,442,A 52-year-old woman presented with history of worsening dysphagia over many years. Recently there had been episodes of ill-defined central chest discomfort and nocturnal cough. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Achalasia,Barrett's oesophagus,Motor neurone disease,Oesophageal carcinoma,Pharyngeal pouch,A,Achalasia presents most often in the third to fifth decades. Symptoms usually develop years before the patient presents. Vague chest discomfort is common. Thirty percent have a nocturnal cough due to aspiration of oesophageal contents. Barrett's oesophagus does not cause dysphagia. MND causes dysphagia due to problems with chewing and initiating a swallow and would not cause chest discomfort. Oesophageal carcinoma is very unlikely due to the duration of symptoms (years). A pharyngeal pouch usually presents in the sixth to seventh decades with regurgitation and would not cause chest discomfort.
gastrointestinal system,443,Which of the following is correct of Barrett's oesophagus?,Cannot be treated by endoscopic ablation,Is a congenital lesion,Is best treated by fundoplication if associated with a hiatus hernia,May be associated with over-expression of the p53 tumour suppressor gene,"May harbour foci of invasive carcinoma, if associated with high grade metaplasia",D,"The p53 tumour suppression gene arrests or delays the G1 phase of the cell cycle allowing for DNA repair. Mutation of p53 converts a tumour suppressor gene into a dominant oncogene. The mutated p53 is more stable and has a higher concentration in tumour cells - over expression. Studies have shown over expression of p53 in Barrett's that may be associated with increased malignant potential. Barrett's oesophagus is when columnar epithelium lines the distal oesophagus, that is, when the squamo-columnar junction is more than 3 cm above the gastro-oesophageal junction. Barrett's predisposes to the development of adenocarcinoma, with a 30-fold increase in these patients. It is associated with p53 over-expression early in carcinogenesis. Some 30-70% of patients with high grade dysplasia (not metaplasia - intestinal metaplasia is the change that is described as Barrett's oesophagus) harbour foci of invasive carcinoma. High grade dysplasia may be considered an indication for oesophagectomy. Treatment options of Barrett's include photodynamic therapy, which may be used to ablate areas of metaplasia, dysplasia or early carcinoma; but there is no evidence that a surgical antireflux procedure will reverse this metaplasia."
gastrointestinal system,444,"A 2-year-old with atrophy of the buttocks, distended abdomen with frequent offensive smelly stool. Choose the single most likely investigation?",Upper GI endoscopy,Endomyseal/alpha glidin antibody,Sweat test,Colonscopy,Stool culture,B,Atrophy of buttock due to fat malabsorption and distended abdomen (sometimes with everted umbilicus) with frequent offensive smelly stools are seen in coeliac disease. Hence endomyseal/alpha gliadin antibody should be done
gastrointestinal system,445,A 43 year old male was in a road traffic accident and suffered major trauma. He is now in the intensive care unit. He has become pyrexial and he appears to be in pain. On examination he appears to be tender in the right upper quadrant. Bloods reveal deranged LFTs and his amylase is also elevated. He also has a leucocytosis. An ultrasound reveals a distended gallbladder with thickened walls and pericholecystic fluid although there is no evidence of gallstones. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute Pancreatitis,Hepatitis,Ascending Cholangitis,Acalculous Cholecystitis,Calculous Cholecystitis,D,Acalculous cholecystitis is most often observed in critically ill patients as in this case. It is thought to be due to bile stasis in these patients as they are likely to have increased bile viscosity due to fever and dehydration and fasting. Often the diagnosis is missed as patients may be unable to provide a history as they are critically ill however it should be suspected in cases such as this. If patients are more alert they may complain of the same symptoms of calculous cholecystitis. The ultrasound is characteristic and excludes the other diagnoses.
gastrointestinal system,446,A 60 year old gentleman with known alcohol excess presents with epigastric pain radiating to his back. This has occurred several times. He also describes steatorrhoea and weight loss. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Coeliac disease,Alcoholic Liver Disease,Gastritis,Chronic pancreatitis,Acute pancreatitis,D,This patients history is highly suggestive of chronic pancreatitis given the features of malabsorption i.e. steatorrhoea and weight loss. The epigastric pain radiating to the back is also indicative. It is less likely to be just acute pancreatitis given the malabsorption symptoms however there may an acute on chronic element. It can also lead to diabetes due to pancreatic insufficiency.
gastrointestinal system,447,"A 40-year-old male presents with a six-hour history of profuse vomiting and over the last two hours had developed left sided chest pain and dyspnoea. On examination, he had a pulse of 110 beats per minute regular and a blood pressure of 168/90 mmHg. On palpation, he had crepitus over the left supraclavicular region and neck, reduced heart sounds and left basal sided crackles, plus some dullness to percussion over the right base of the chest. What is the most appropriate initial investigation?",CT with oral contrast,Echocardiogram,Gastrografin swallow,Rigid oesophagoscopy,Upper GI endoscopy,C,"This man has a history of severe vomiting which then progressed to chest pain. The most relevant finding on examination is the crepitus over the chest indicating surgical emphysema. The most probable cause is spontaneous rupture of the oesophagus. Mackler's triad (vomiting, chest pain and surgical emphysema) is classical but absent in almost half the cases. The chest x ray may confirm the surgical emphysema. Gastrografin swallow will confirm the site of perforation in approximately 65-75% of cases and is the recommended first line investigation. Barium is more sensitive at 90% for detecting small perforations but carries the risk of a severe inflammatory response (mediastinitis). A CT with contrast can then be performed to confirm the site of perforation, as well as imaging the other surrounding structures. Lateral neck x rays may be useful in the early stages where the diagnosis is uncertain and surgical emphysema is not seen on a plain CXR. Oesophagoscopy has a role in if the Gastrografin swallow is negative. "
gastrointestinal system,448,A 72-year-old man is found to have a suspicious lesion in the left lobe of the liver whilst being investigated for right upper quadrant pain. Which of the following is true of percutaneous needle biopsy of the liver?,Is indicated to make a tissue diagnosis in suspected hydatid disease of the liver,Is associated with a mortality rate of 0.5%,Is associated with a recognised risk of pneumothorax,Should be avoided in suspected metastatic disease of the liver,Should only be performed with a normal coagulation screen,C,"Needle biopsy of the liver is not without risk, with bleeding being the most common side effect but fatal complications have been reported in up to 0.1% of biopsied patients (range 0.009-0.1%). In fact, pneumothorax, although rare is also recognised. Although a normal coagulation profile is ideal, it is not essential for the procedure. It should not be performed in patients with suspected hydatid disease because of the risk of seeding. However, malignancy is not a contra-indication and needle biopsy is often performed to elucidate potential malignant deposits."
gastrointestinal system,449,Which of the following concerning the conjugation of bilirubin is correct?,It is catalysed by a glucuronyl transferase,It is impaired in Dubin-Johnson syndrome,It is increased by valproate,It is inhibited by rifampicin,It occurs in the Kupfer cells of the liver,A,"In Dubin-Johnson syndrome, conjugation is normal, but excretion from the hepatocyte into the bile is impaired, resulting in a conjugated bilirubinaemia. Sodium valproate is an enzyme inhibitor. Rifampicin is an enzyme inducer. Bilirubin is conjugated in the hepatocytes. In both Gilbert's and Crigler-Najjar syndrome, there is an impairment of UDP glucuronosyltransferase. In Crigler-Najjar levels are extremely low (undetectable in type 1 and less than10% in type 2), whereas in Gilbert's levels are less significantly reduced. Both are associated with an unconjugated bilirubinaemia."
gastrointestinal system,450,"A 68-year-old male with an inoperable oesophageal carcinoma has undergone placement of a self-expanding metal stent to palliate his malignant dysphagia. Unfortunately, he has presented two months later with a four hour history of acute dysphagia which began when while eating a pizza. What is the initial best management for this condition?",Endosopic removal,Fizzy drink,Laser ablation,Oesophagectomy,Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG),B,"Patients with oesophageal cancer tend to present late with progressive dysphagia, weight loss and anaemia. Oesophagectomy is reserved for early cancers which have not invaded locally. Traditionally malignant dysphagia was treated with repeated endoscopic dilatations. Endoscopic placement of self-expanding metal stents (SEMS) are now placed most frequently in patients presenting with malignant dysphagia. Early complications of SEMS are:  Malposition Oesophageal perforation Bleeding, and Stent migration.  Late complications are most frequently related to eating (food bolus) or tumour overgrowth. Initially, management of a food bolus blocking a stent is for the patient to consume a fizzy drink, which helps to break up the food bolus, otherwise endoscopy is required to dislodge the food bolus."
gastrointestinal system,451,A 65-year-old man was investigated for weight loss and dyspepsia. Endoscopic examination revealed an ulcerated lesion in the stomach and biopsy revealed the presence of a low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoma (MALT) with Helicobacter pylori. Further investigation with CT of chest and abdomen were normal as were bone marrow aspirate and trephine. What is the best treatment option for this patient?,Eradication therapy for Helicobacter pylori,IV chemotherapy,Oral chlorambucil,Partial gastric resection,Radiotherapy,A,This is a gastric MALT tumour. These are usually marginal zone B cell lymphomas and associated with an excellent prognosis. Low-grade gastric MALT tumours associated with Helicobacter pylori infection respond in over 80% to Helicobacter eradication as the primary mode of treatment. Radiotherapy is considered but is generally unnecessary.
gastrointestinal system,452,A 46-year-old man is being investigated for indigestion. Jejunal biopsy shows deposition of macrophages containing PAS (Periodic acid-schiff) +ve granules. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Bacterial overgrowth,Celiac disease,Tropical sprue,Whipple’s disease,Small bowel lymphoma,D,"periodic acid-schiff +ve granules containing macrophages in jejunal biopsy is diagnostic of whipples disease. Whipple disease is a systemic disease most likely caused by a gram-positive bacterium, Tropherymawhippelii. Although the first descriptions of the disorder described a malabsorption syndrome with small intestine involvement, the disease also affects the joints, central nervous system, and cardiovascular system"
gastrointestinal system,453,A 34-year-old lady has been admitted as an emergency with abdominal pain. Blood tests have already been performed and show an elevated amylase. Which of the following disorders is most likely to be the cause of this patient's acute pancreatitis?,Gallstones,Hypercortisolaemia,Hyperlipidaemia,Mumps,Trauma,A,"Gallstones and alcohol cause 95% of cases of pancreatitis. Other causes include:  Trauma Metabolic abnormalities (including hypercalcaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and hypercortisolaemia) Iatrogenic causes (such as drugs and instrumentation of the biliary tract). and Viruses."
gastrointestinal system,454,What is the mode of inheritance of Gilbert's syndrome?,Autosomal dominant,Autosomal recessive,X-linked dominant,X-linked recessive,None of the above,B,"Gilbert's syndrome results from a defect in the promotor of the gene which encodes the enzyme uridine diphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1). This enzyme is responsible for the conjugation of bilirubin with glucuronic acid. Inheritance is autosomal recessive therefore the condition manifests only in people who are homozygous for the variant promoter. Jaundice in patients with Gilbert's syndrome can be triggered by events which lead to increased production of bilirubin, including:  fasting haemolysis intercurrent febrile illnesses physical exertion stress, and menses.  "
gastrointestinal system,455,Which of the following is true regarding intestinal malrotation?,Is corrected by Pringle's procedure,May be associated with volvulus around a narrow-based mesentery,May be diagnosed if the duodeno-jejunal flexure is to the left of the midline on contrast study,May involve the entire hindgut,Presents most commonly in the second to third year of life,B,"Malrotation is due to failure of normal midgut rotation during embryogenesis. Volvulus around the narrow based mesentery is potentially fatal. Two thirds of cases present within the first month of life and bilious vomiting is characteristic. An upper gastrointestinal contrast study is performed (if the baby is well), and if the duodeno-jejunal flexure is positioned to the right of the midline this is extremely suggestive of malrotation. It is corrected by Ladd's procedure which broadens the base of the mesentery and places the bowel in a non-rotated state (that is, stable and not prone to volvulus).   BMJ: "
gastrointestinal system,456,A 50-year-old woman is admitted to the surgical ward for resection of a colorectal carcinoma. She has type 2 diabetes and her current glycaemic control is good on 5 mg glibenclamide daily. Which of the following is the most appropriate pre-operative management plan for this patient's glycaemic control?,Continue glibenclamide at current dose,Give one bolus injection of insulin plus potassium just before surgery,Increase the dose of glibenclamide to 15 mg,Stop glibenclamide before surgery,Stop glibenclamide on the morning of surgery and commence insulin by intravenous infusion,E,"The most appropriate answer is to stop glibenclamide on the morning of surgery, using IV insulin and potassium. This patient is undergoing major surgery, therefore glycaemic control needs to be optimal during this period of extreme stress. This is best achieved by stopping the glibenclamide on the morning of surgery and starting the patient on IV insulin and IV dextrose with potassium. At this time the rate of insulin infusion can then be adjusted according to frequent blood glucose measurements."
gastrointestinal system,457,"A 60-year-old lady has a six-month history of abdominal discomfort, bloating and altered frequency in stools. Her symptoms seem to be worse following a large meal when she also feels nauseated. Clinical examination is normal. She is suspected of fulfilling the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome. Which of the following investigations should be undertaken to exclude other diagnoses?",Anti-tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies,Faecal occult blood,Faecal ova/parasite tests,Sigmoidoscopy,Thyroid function test,A,"Patients who fulfil the diagnostic criteria for irritable bowel syndrome should be screened for other conditions with:  full blood count (FBC) erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (or plasma viscosity) C-reactive protein (CRP) anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA), and tissue transglutaminase (TTG) antibodies.  This lady's presentation fits with a diagnosis of coeliac disease, which can present at any age (although peaks occur in babies and in the third decade). In the UK 1% - 2% of the population are affected but many cases go under-diagnosed. The condition is caused by an immunological reaction to the gliadin fraction of wheat which provokes an inflammatory response and results in partial or total villous atrophy in the proximal small bowel (which resolves with a gluten-free diet). HLA DQ2 is present in 90-95% of Caucasian patients with coeliac disease, the majority of the remainder have HLA DQ8. HLA-DQ2 is present in 20-30% of the Caucasian population and the possession of this HLA antigen alone is insufficient for development of coeliac disease. Patients with coeliac disease present with diarrhoea, oral ulcers, weight loss, malaise, and abdominal pain. Nutritional deficiencies can result in neurological symptoms (ataxia, weakness, paraesthesia) and amenorrhoea. Folate, B12, or iron deficiency can be present as can osteomalacia and abnormal liver function tests. Some patients have dermatitis herpetiformis (an itchy rash mainly affecting the extensor aspects of the elbows). Diagnosis is with anti-endomysial or tissue transglutaminase antibodies and upper GI endoscopy with duodenal biopsy. Treatment is by strict avoidance of wheat, rye, and barley. Folate, iron and calcium supplements may be required. Antibodies typically become negative if there is good compliance with a gluten-free diet. There is no history of tropical travel so parasite infection is less likely here. You would expect other symptoms to be described if this patient has hyperthyroidism. This history is not classical for lower gastrointestinal malignancy and therefore sigmoidoscopy and faecal occult blood are less likely to reveal the underlying diagnosis here."
gastrointestinal system,458,Which of the following is true regarding intussusception?,Commonly occurs during adolescence,Is associated with haemophilia,Is more common in girls,Is not associated with any signs on per abdominal examination,Leads to haematemesis,B,"Intussusception occurs when a segment of bowel invaginates into its adjoining lower segment. It is more common in boys. About 60% are under 1-year-old and 80%-90% under 2 years old. It is rare after the age of 6. Intussusception is associated with:  Haemophilia Henoch-Schönlein purpura Haemangiomas, and GI lymphomas.  Clinical features include severe colicky abdominal pain and vomiting. Between attacks the infant may appear in good health. The infant may pass 'redcurrant jelly' stools and a sausage shaped mass is palpable on abdominal examination. Rectal examination may reveal blood in the majority of cases and occasionally the apex of the intussusception is palpable."
gastrointestinal system,459,"A 39-year-old sailor has had repeated visits to his GP for heartburn and dyspepsia. He had been an irregular visitor and his treatments had been discontinuous in the past. This time, after an acute episode of dyspepsia and abdominal pain, he underwent an upper GI endoscopy which showed Barret's esophagus. Histopathology showed very low-grade dysplasia. What is the best next line of management?",A trial of PPI therapy,Endoscopic ablation therapy,Endoscopic mucosal resection,Lower esophageal resection,Only observation,A,"Barret's oesophagus occurs due to gastro-oesophagal reflux disease. The initial therapy for this condition is PPI-based. Usually, once-daily dosing of PPI is preferred. Observation only is not a preferred strategy. Barret's oesophagus is a premalignant condition. Hence, quick intervention is needed. The three remaining therapies are used in the NICE pathways in patients with moderate to severe grade dysplasia. Also, if there is inadequate response to PPI therapy, then these modalities of treatment may be tried. They are also used for recurrent disease. "
gastrointestinal system,460,Which of the following is more frequently a complication of ulcerative colitis (UC) than of Crohn's disease (CD)?,Acute toxic dilatation of the colon,Aphthous ulcers,Enterocutaneous fistulae,Gallstones,Perianal abscesses,A,"Toxic megacolon can complicate Crohn's colitis, pseudomembranous colitis and infectious colitis, but it is most commonly seen with severe UC. Aphthous mouth ulcers are more common with Crohn's disease than UC, but they may be seen in up to 10% of patients with active UC. Despite a widely held view to the contrary, there is good evidence that with the same duration and anatomic extent, the risk of colon cancer in Crohn's disease is at least as great as that with UC. Only a small percentage of those with CD however have extensive colitis. Gallstones are seen in 15-30% of patients with small bowel Crohn's disease, due to alterations in the bile salt pool secondary to ileal dysfunction +/- surgical resection. Perianal fissures, fistulae, or abscesses eventually occur in about one third of patients with Crohn's disease."
gastrointestinal system,461,A 42-year-old woman presents to the surgical clinic with recurrent episodes of right upper quadrant pain. An abdominal ultrasound scan confirms a calculus gallbladder. Which one of the following is associated with an increased incidence of gallstones?,Antihypertensive therapy,Hyperparathyroidism,Oral contraceptive therapy,Pernicious anaemia,Statin therapy,C,"Cholelithiasis is associated with any process that would increase bile production or produce sludging. Increased risk is associated with:  Haemolysis Pregnancy Oral contraceptive therapy, and Octreotide therapy.  Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3HMG-CoA and do not predispose to biliary stasis. Hyperparathyroidism predisposes to renal calculi. "
gastrointestinal system,462,"The surgical registrar on duty calls you to ask for advice. A 24-year-old female patient was admitted under their care the previous night and underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy for investigation of abdominal pain. The examination was normal, the pain has subsided and the plan is to discharge the patient. The patient is from abroad and wants to travel back to her home country. She would like to know how soon after laparoscopy she might undertake an airline flight. What would your reply be?",48 hours,After five days,After one week,Immediately,Ten days,A,"Modern aircraft normally cruise at between 35,000 to 43,000 feet. As this environment would be non-physiological, the aircraft cabin is pressurised to a maximum cabin altitude of 8,000 feet. This reduced atmospheric pressure would cause gas in body cavities to expand by 30-40%. Hence, air travel should be delayed for 48 hours after laparoscopy to allow all gas to be absorbed."
gastrointestinal system,463,"A 49-year-old woman with a previous history of IV drug abuse comes to the clinic for review. Over the past few months she has suffered flitting joint pains and increasing fatigue. She has also developed a purpuric rash affecting her arms and legs and suffered from two transient episodes of VIIth nerve palsy in the past year. On examination her BP is 122/82, pulse is 80 and regular. You confirm the purpuric rash and evidence of small joint synovitis. There are a number of spider naevi over the upper body and some small palpable lymph nodes in both axillae. Investigations:    Hb 118g/l 115-160   WCC 9.2 x10^9/l 6-10   PLT 138 x 10^9/l 150-400   Na 138 mmol/l 135-145   K 3.8 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 98 µmol/l 60-90   Glucose 5.9 mmol/l less than7.0   ALT 150 U/l 7-56   Alk phos 215 IU/l 44-147   Bilirubin 18 µmol/l less than22   Cryoglobulins 0.03g/l less than0.01   CXR Normal film    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autoimmune hepatitis,Hepatitis B,Hepatitis C,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,Primary biliary cirrhosis,C,"The answer is Hepatitis C. The history of previous drug abuse, with raised LFTs, should lead to consider viral hepatitis as a cause of her symptoms, and it is Hepatitis C which is most commonly associated with cryoglobulinaemia. Anti-virals +/- B cell targeting agents such as rituximab are the mainstay of intervention. Cryoglobulins are also described in association with both autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, although both are less likely diagnoses given the previous history of IV drug abuse. Although there are some small palpable lymph nodes, more marked changes including potentially enlarged hilar lymph nodes on the CXR would be expected in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."
gastrointestinal system,464,A 26-year-old presents in the first trimester of her first pregnancy (six weeks gestation) for an antenatal check; she feels well. Blood tests show a bilirubin of 40 µmol/L (1-22). The other LFTs are completely normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Cholestasis of pregnancy,Dubin-Johnson syndrome (DJS),Gilbert's syndrome,Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC),C,"Gilbert's is the most common condition causing mild isolated hyperbilirubinaemia. PBC and PSC are much less common conditions and are almost always associated with a rise in the other liver function tests, particularly alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and gammaglutamyltransferase GGT). DJS is much less common than Gilbert's. Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is relatively common but usually occurs in the second or third trimester; ALP is usually high, risk increases with multiparity."
gastrointestinal system,465,A 56-year-old male presents with generalised fatigue and upper abdominal discomfort with some weight loss over the last six months. He has otherwise been well but admits to consuming 10 units of alcohol per day. On examination you note 2 cm hepatomegaly. Liver function tests show an:    ALT 100 IU/L (5-35)   AST 210 IU/L (1-31)   Alkaline Phosphatase 250 IU/L (45-105)   MCV 110 fL (80-96)    Which of the following is the most likely cause of his presentation?.,Alcoholic hepatitis,Chronic active hepatitis,Hepatoma,Metastatic liver disease,Viral hepatitis,A,Alcoholic hepatitis is a syndrome of progressive inflammatory liver injury associated with long-term heavy intake of ethanol. Patients who are severely affected present with:  subacute onset of fever hepatomegaly leukocytosis marked impairment of liver function.  The liver exhibits:  characteristic centrilobular ballooning necrosis of hepatocytes neutrophilic infiltration large mitochondria and Mallory hyaline inclusions.  Steatosis (fatty liver) and cirrhosis frequently accompany alcoholic hepatitis. 
gastrointestinal system,466,An 8-year-old has had recurrent abdominal pain for 2 months. His appetite is reduced and he has faecal soiling. There are pitting masses throughout the abdomen. He has a dilated rectum. What is the single most appropriate management?,Proton pump inhibitor,Pyeloplasty (+/- percutaneous nephrostomy),Enema and laxative,Aspirin,Triple therapy,C,Pitting masses throughout the abdomen with dilated rectum indicates retained faecal matter. Enema and laxative are the treatment
gastrointestinal system,467,Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is associated with which of the following?,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Osteomata of the clavicle,Protein malabsorption,Retinal pigmentation,White nails,D,"The APC gene is on chromosome 5q distal to 5'. Inheritance is autosomal dominant. The average onset of colorectal cancer is 39 years. Because many cases present earlier, baseline flexible sigmoidoscopy is offered from 10-12 years of age with annual screening thereafter. Gastroscopy is performed three yearly once colonic polyps are present due to gastric and small bowel polyp formation. Family screening is important. Treatment is total colectomy with ileo-anal pouch formation, or ileostomy for multiple polyps, usually in the patient's early twenties. The attenuated form of the disease (also AD inheritance, Chr 5q proximal to 5') presents with fewer polyps and flat adenomas with a proximal predilection. Onset of colorectal cancer (CRC) is later, at a mean of 50 years. Osteomata of the mandible are one feature of Gardener's variant of APC. Others include epidermoid cysts of the skin and congenital pigmentation of the retinal pigment epithelium. APC is also associated with intra-abdominal desmoid tumour formation. The tumours do not tend to metastasise, but cause local complications which can be fatal. Neither protein losing enteropathy, nor white nails are part of the clinical spectrum of APC."
gastrointestinal system,468,Which ONE of the following is true of pancreatitis?,A serum amylase above 1000 iu/l is a poor prognostic factor,Can be differentiated from severe acute cholecystitis when the serum amylase is greater than three times its normal value,Has a 1% mortality when associated with an Glasgow score of 3 or more on admission,Is an absolute contraindication to ERCP,Octreotide has been shown to reduce mortality,B,"A serum amylase of greater than three times its normal value is virtually diagnostic of acute pancreatitis. Levels below this may also be caused by:  mumps ruptured pancreatic cyst perforated peptic ulcer cholecystitis, and mesenteric infarction.  The importance of serum amylase is that it is a diagnostic tool and the level is no indication of severity. On the other hand, glucose, white cell count lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate transaminase (AST) are used on initial assessment in the Imrie criteria to score severity, giving an indication to prognosis and likelihood of requiring admission to intensive care. A Glasgow score of 3 is associated with mortality of 10-20%. With a score of above 5, mortality is of the order of 50%. The majority of cases of pancreatitis require supportive treatment and careful monitoring only. Medical management may include the use of antibiotics in selected cases and ERCP may be therapeutic in gallstone pancreatitis. Octreotide, a somatostatin analogue, lacks evidence in reducing mortality and is therefore not used."
gastrointestinal system,469,A 38-year-old female is admitted as an emergency with severe right upper quadrant pain and vomiting. On examination she is pyrexial and palpation reveals tenderness and peritonism at the level of the tip of the ninth rib. Investigations reveal:    Bilirubin 9 mol/L (1-22)   Amylase 50 U/L (50-130)   Haemoglobin 128 g/L (115-165)   Platelets 172 ×10^9/L (150-400)   White cell count 15 ×10^9/L (4-11)    What is the likely diagnosis?,Acute cholecystitis,Acute pancreatitis,Ascending cholangitis,Biliary colic,Obstructive jaundice,A,"All options are manifestations of gallstone disease, however the combination of pyrexia together with an elevated white cell count and local peritonism (Murphy's sign) is classical of acute cholecystitis. The normal amylase effectively eliminates pancreatitis, whilst the normal bilirubin rules out jaundice and cholangitis (also usually associated with fever and tenderness: Charcot's triad). The presence of peritonism and an elevated white cell count would not be expected in biliary colic."
gastrointestinal system,470,A 69-year-old man undergoes selective portal vein embolisation prior to surgery for hepatic metastases. What overall growth effect is achieved in the non-embolised parts of the liver by the embolisation procedure?,Atrophy,Dysplasia,Hypertrophy,Metaplasia,Neoplasia,C,"Hypertrophy occurs when there is an increase in the size of cells but the number of cells does not change. In the case of portal vein embolisation, an increasingly utilised technique, the branch of the portal vein supplying the diseased liver is embolised with the effect of causing atrophy of the embolised segment and hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the remaining liver. This then allows adequate hepatic reserve for a major resection."
gastrointestinal system,471,"A 35 year old female presents to clinic with diarrhoea. She has recently undergone a renal transplant and is currently on prednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil and ciclosporin. Diarrhoea is watery, there is no evidence of any blood however there is evidence of mucus and her bowel is moving about 10 times per day. On examination her abdomen is soft but she looks unwell and dehydrated. What is the most likely cause of the diarrhoea?",Acute rejection,Infective gastroenteritis,Ciclosporin,Prednisolone,Mycophenolate mofetil,E,The most likely cause in this case is mycophenolate mofetil which leads to a Crohns like enterocolitis. Rejection would not explain the symptoms. Although infective gastroenteritis is an option this would be less likely to cause such a prolonged course especially when there is other precipitating factors such as the mycophenolate mofetil.
gastrointestinal system,472,"A 31-year-old hairdresser presents to her general practitioner with a four month history of fever and chills, abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea. She also states that she passes air occasionally when she attempts to pass urine. On examination, she is tender over the right iliac fossa. Per rectal examination is unremarkable but a few small ulcers are noticed around the perianal region. Colonoscopy reveals skip lesions of linear ulcers and transverse fissures giving cobblestone appearance of the mucosa. CT scan reveals an enterovesical fistula. Which of the following is the correct diagnosis?",Carcinoma of the caecum,Carcinoma of the sigmoid colon,Crohn’s disease,Typhoid gastroenteritis,Ulcerative colitis,C,"Crohn's disease is an auto-immune condition characterised by transmural inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. This can affect any part of the tract from mouth to the anus, although it frequently affects the terminal ileum. The common clinical presentations include:  Loss of appetite Loss of weight Fever Abdominal pain, and Altered bowel habits such as constipation and diarrhoea, the latter being more common.  Crohn's disease is characterised by skip lesions (patchy areas of inflammation) and by deep serpiginous ulcers. The disease may manifest with the formation perianal ulcers and fistulas. This patient has developed an enterovesical fistula which is causing her to pass air when she attempts to pass urine."
gastrointestinal system,473,Coeliac disease is associated with which of the following?,Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel,Family history of inflammatory bowel disease,Gallstones,Granulomatous myositis,Predisposed increase incidence of tuberculosis,A,"Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the small bowel, which return to baseline with diet. Longstanding disease may lead to other complications such as ulcerative jejunitis and stricturing. The changes in the bowel make it less able to absorb nutrients, minerals and the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Coeliac disease has been linked to:  Dermatitis herpetiformis Epilepsy Ataxia Myelopathy Peripheral neuropathy Malnutrition Hyposplenism Diabetes mellitus type 1 Autoimmune thyroiditis, and Primary biliary cirrhosis."
gastrointestinal system,474,"A 33-year-old man with chronic hepatitis C is admitted with general deterioration; he has no specific symptoms. He has missed many of his previous outpatient appointments and currently is not receiving any treatment. On examination, he is generally unwell with a temperature of 37.4°C, blood pressure of 130/72 mmHg and appears jaundiced with the presence of ascites. His investigations reveal:    Serum sodium 133 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 4.3 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 21 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum Creatinine 336 µmol/L (60-110)   Bilirubin 78 µmol/L (1-22)   AST 92 U/L (5-35)   Alk phosphatase 267 U/L (45-105)   Albumin 30 g/L (37-49)   Urine sodium 60 mmol/L -       Urine dipstick + Blood   +++ Protein   Leukocytes trace   Nitrites negative    Ascitic fluid analysis:    RBC 1,231/mm^3   WBC 190/mm^3 (60% lymphocytes)   Albumin 12 g/L    Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?",Abdominal tuberculosis,Hepatorenal syndrome,Mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia,Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis,Urinary tract infection,C,"This gentleman has renal failure with evidence of a primary renal pathology: significant proteinuria, relative hypertension. Hepatitis C infection is strongly associated with mixed essential cryoglobulinaemia which may produce mesangiocapillary (also known as membranoproliferative) glomerulonephritis. This condition is associated with renal impairment, systemic vasculitic manifestations (including neuropathy, skin manifestations) and arterial thrombosis. Hepatorenal syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires:  correction of hypovolaemia withdrawal of any diuretics treatment of sepsis, and exclusion of a primary renal pathology prior to diagnosis.  In hepatorenal syndrome, the kidneys are functionally normal and biopsy is normal; where patients in this situation receive liver transplantation, the kidneys will almost always resume normal function. The urinary sodium and urine dipstick results given here indicate a primary renal pathology. The ascitic tap results indicate that ascites is due to portal hypertension (serum albumin ascites gradient greater than11 g/L) and do not support the presence of infection within the ascitic fluid, counting against both abdominal tuberculosis and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In the absence of symptoms, a urine dipstick indicating a trace of leukocytes and negative nitrites is poorly predictive of the presence of a urinary tract infection. Additionally this diagnosis does not adequately explain the degree of proteinuria or renal impairment."
gastrointestinal system,475,"In post-gastrectomy syndromes, which of the following is true?",Anaemia is more common after gastroduodenostomy than gastrojejunostomy,Anaemia is seen in all cases,Early dumping is associated with abdominal pain,Early dumping is due to rebound hypoglycaemia,Folate deficiency is common,C,"Features of post-gastrectomy syndrome include early and late 'dumping'. Early dumping seen in most patients in convalescence, but persists in 5-12%, and is associated with epigastric fullness, abdominal colic, sensation of warmth, sweating, tachycardia, vomiting or diarrhoea, and commences immediately after a meal. Late dumping is associated with an insulin surge and hypoglycaemia. Anaemia may be megaloblastic (vitamin B12 deficiency) or iron deficient. Hypocalcaemia is also well described, causing (late) osteomalacia with backache and weakness. Folate deficiency would be perishingly rare."
gastrointestinal system,476,"The paediatric surgeons are asked to review a new-born baby boy with mild abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, and failure to pass meconium after 24 hours. Plain abdominal x ray reveals dilated loops of bowel with fluid levels. Barium enema demonstrates a 'conical appearance' in a segment of the colon. Choose the single most appropriate diagnosis.",Hirschsprung's disease,Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis,Intestinal atresia,Intussusception,Meckel's diverticulum,A,Hirschsprung's disease is an absence of ganglion cells in the neural plexus of the intestinal wall. It is more common in boys. The delayed passage of meconium together with distension of abdomen following feeds and bilious vomiting are the usual clinical features. Plain abdominal x ray may demonstrate dilated loops of bowel with fluid levels. Barium enema demonstrates a 'conical appearance' in the affected part due to the dilated ganglionic proximal colon and the distal aganglionic bowel failing to distend.
gastrointestinal system,477,A 25-year-old student has complained of recurrent bloody diarrhoea and symptoms of iritis. He has a painful nodular erythematous eruption on the shin and examination of the anus reveals anal tags. What investigation would you like to perform to confirm the diagnosis?,Barium enema,Colonoscopy,HLA B-27,Rheumatoid factor,Serum ACE,B,"The diagnosis is inflammatory bowel disease, the anal skin tags suggest Crohn's disease. Other extra-abdominal features consistent with this diagnosis are iritis and the skin rash which could be erythema nodosum. A colonoscopy with biopsies would be the initial investigations and may well confirm the diagnosis. Though serum ACE levels can aid in diagnosis they are often raised in other conditions other than sarcoidosis."
gastrointestinal system,478,Which of the following features of Haemochromatosis responds with venesection?,Testicular atrophy,Diabetes,Arthropathy,Cardiomyopathy,Cirrhosis,D,"Haemochromatosis can lead to cardiomyopathy and this can improve with venesection. Unfortunately arthropathy, testicular atrophy, cirrhosis and diabetes mellitus very rarely respond to venesection."
gastrointestinal system,479,Which of the following statements is correct regarding intussusception?,Has a characteristic 'hour-glass' appearance on ultrasound,Is a common cause of intestinal obstruction between 6 and 12 years of age,Precipitants may include an inflamed Peyer's patch,Presents with few clinical signs,Usually occurs in the jejunum,C,"Intussusception is the commonest cause of intestinal obstruction in the 6 to 18 months age group. It often occurs in the distal ileum, with ileo-colic intussusception being the most common type. Precipitants may include an inflamed Peyer's patch or a Meckel's diverticulum. The infants with intussusception usually present with:  Severe intermittent colic Bile-stained vomiting Rectal bleeding  and 30% have a 'sausage-shaped' abdominal mass. The diagnosis can often be confirmed by a 'doughnut' appearance on ultrasound."
gastrointestinal system,480,"A 52-year-old male presents with jaundice and feeling generally unwell. He is a sewage worker. Over the last week, he was having a non-productive cough and a headache which hasn't settled. He spent most of the day resting as he felt too weak and tired to do anything. He was pyrexial over the last 24 hours. On examination, you noticed he has swollen ankles and some crackles bilateral at the bases. His blood test revealed the following:    ALP 138   ALT 420   Bilirubin 64   Urea 18.3   Creatinine 200   Na 137   K 4.5   Hb 105   Platelets 120   WCC 15.1   Neutrophils 11.1    What is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Alcoholic Hepatitis,Cholangitis,Dengue Fever,Hepatitis A,Weil's Disease,E,"Weil's disease is the severe form of leptospirosis. Leptospirosis is an infection caused by bacteria called Leptospira. It is transmitted by both wild and domestic animals, but the most common are rodents. It is often transmitted via the urine of rodents. Signs and symptoms can range from mild symptoms such as cough, nausea and vomiting headaches, muscle pains, and fevers to severe symptoms such as meningitis. If the infection causes jaundice, kidney failure and bleeding, it is then known as Weil's disease. If it affects the lung and causes pulmonary haemorrhage, then it is known as severe pulmonary haemorrhage syndrome. As the patient is a sewage worker, he is a risk of leptospirosis.  Hepatitis A and alcoholic hepatitis is unlikely to present with acute kidney injury. Cholangitis presents as post hepatic jaundice but this patient presented with hepatic jaundice. Dengue fever usually present as are sudden-onset fever, headache (typically located behind the eyes), muscle and joint pains, and a rash. Weil's disease is a life- threatening condition and is treated aggressively with IV antibiotics, supportive therapy and in some situations, dialysis. Effective antibiotics include penicillin, doxycycline, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone. "
gastrointestinal system,481,A 29-year-old lady who is a bank manager is referred by the GP to the medical OPD due to a long history of tiredness and pain in the joints. An autoimmune screen result showed smooth muscle antibodies positive. What is the most appropriate next investigation?,ECG,TFT,LFT,Serum glucose,Jejunal biopsy,C,A case of autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is an uncommon cause of chronic hepatitis which if untreated can lead to cirrhosis. However with treatment outlook is very good. Smooth muscle antibody is positive in autoimmune hepatitis. Definitive investigation is liver biopsy. Treated with steroid [start with high dose prednisolone

Which of the following conditions predisposes to malignancy?,Diverticular disease of the colon,Polycystic disease of the ovaries,Prolactinomas,Turcot syndrome,Turner's syndrome,D,Turcot syndrome refers to adenomatous tumours of the colon and central nervous system. Paget's disease is associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma. Prolactinomas do not predispose to either breast or pituitary malignancy.
gastrointestinal system,483,A 35-year-old man has weakness and tiredness. His blood pressure is 145/100 mm Hg. Electrolytes show hypokalaemia and hypomagnesaemia. Which investigation would you select to make the diagnosis?,Colonoscopy,Oral glucose tolerance test,Plasma renin to aldosterone ratio,Serum amylase,Serum calcium,C,"This scenario illustrates that young patients with hypertension may have underlying secondary causes. This patient has primary hyperaldosteronism, which is thought to be a reasonably common cause of hypertension. Primary hyperaldosteronism is associated with high aldosterone, suppressed renin, alkalosis, low potassium, low magnesium and normal/high sodium. An important differential diagnosis here is renal artery stenosis. Causes of primary hyperaldosteronism include:  Conn's syndrome (adrenal adenoma) causes over 50% Adrenal hyperplasia Adrenal carcinoma (rare) Glucocorticoid deficiency - also called glucocorticoid-remediable aldosteronism. Note that this is isolated glucocorticoid (cortisol) deficiency driving high ACTH levels and increased aldosterone production. Addison's disease is different as it involves both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deficiencies."
gastrointestinal system,484,"A 55-year-old male is admitted with vomiting. He has a long history of alcohol abuse, appears slightly jaundiced, and is dishevelled and unkempt. He was started on an intravenous glucose infusion and diazepam and he symptomatically improved. One day later he became confused, developed vomiting and diplopia, and was unable to stand. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Benzodiazepine intoxication,Delirium tremens,Hepatic encephalopathy,Subdural haematoma,Vitamin B deficiency,E,"This patient is manifesting signs of Wernicke's encephalopathy with confusion, oculomotor signs, and ataxia affecting gait and stance. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a medical emergency, requiring urgent intravenous thiamine. The episode has been precipitated by intravenous dextrose administration which has exhausted his vitamin B reserves, hence B vitamins must be administered to all alcoholic patients requiring dextrose."
gastrointestinal system,485,A 60 year old gentleman has just complete a course of coamoxiclav for a lower respiratory tract infection. He present very unwell with severe diarrhoea which is green in colour and is foul smelling. There is no blood or mucous. Samples are sent and a flexible sigmoidoscopy is performed and reveals a colitis. There is evidence of dilatation of his large bowel on abdominal x ray. How should you manage this patient?,IV fluids and IV vancomycin,IV fluids and oral metronidazole,IV fluids and oral ciprofloxacin,IV fluids,Await stool sample results before commencing treatment,B,This patient is very likely to have C. Difficile infection given the history of recent coamoxiclav and the green colour of the stool. It can lead to toxic dilatation and leads to pseudomembranous colitis. Patients should be fluid resuscitated and treated with metronidazole ideally orally. Vancomycin orally is also utilised in the treatment however it is not used IV.
gastrointestinal system,486,What is true in regards to gamma GT?,Used to monitor hepatic disease,Isolated increase of GGT in obstructive jaundice,Increased GGT levels in alcohol excess and fatty liver,Not increased in obstructive jaundice,Specific to the liver,C,"GGT is found many tissues including the liver, pancreas and bone. It is increased with alcohol intake and in fatty liver. A raised GGT with ALP is indicative of obstructive jaundice. Bilirubin is typically utilised to monitor response to treatment in liver disease."
gastrointestinal system,487,A 21-year-old woman is referred from the Emergency Department with a paracetamol overdose. Which of the following is an indication for liver transplantation in acute liver failure as a result of paracetamol overdose?,Arterial pH less than7.35,Bilirubin greater than200 µmol/L,Creatinine greater than250 µmol/L,Grade I encephalopathy,Prothrombin time greater than100 seconds (INR greater than6.7),E,"The King's College Criteria are the most widely accepted prognostic tool for patients who present with acute liver failure. Fulfilment of these criteria has a high specificity for mortality, but the sensitivity and negative predictive value remain low. They can be used to guide which patients should be considered for liver transplanation.  For acute liver failure secondary to paracetamol overdose, the criteria are: pH less than7.30 or INR greater than6.5 (PT greater than100 seconds) and serum creatinine greater than300 µmol/L (greater than3.4 mg/dL) in patients with grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy. Serum bilirubin is only considered in cases of acute liver failure not secondary to paracetamol overdose.  There are a variety of complications with liver transplantation such as:  immunological rejection effects of immunosuppressive drugs used infection, and disease recurrence.  "
gastrointestinal system,488,Which of the following demonstrates autosomal dominant inheritance?,Acute intermittent porphyria,Cystic fibrosis,Dubin-Johnson syndrome,Haemochromatosis,Wilson's disease,A,"Acute intermittent porphyria is an autosomal disorder. Clinical features include abdominal pain and constipation. Associated neurological manifestations such as polyneuropathy and epilepsy are also seen. Urinary porphobilinogen is greater than four times the upper limit of normal. Management includes analgesia - opiates are often required. High carbohydrate intake and in severe attacks haem infusion inhibit haem production and thereby reduce porphyrin synthesis.^1 Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive disease, where mutations in the gene for the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) results in the production of dry protein-rich secretions leading to pulmonary and gastrointestinal complications. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder where there is conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia and impaired bilirubin excretion resulting in mild jaundice but normal liver function. Haemochromatosis demonstrates autosomal recessive inheritance where iron overload can lead to cirrhosis. Other systems are also affected and patients may suffer from:  cardiomyopathy diabetes mellitus hypogonadism skin pigmentation ('bronze diabetes') and arthropathy.  Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by copper retention and impaired incorporation of copper into caeruloplasmin. Patients may develop acute liver failure, and the disease is also a cause of cirrhosis. There may be neuropsychiatric manifestations such as parkinsonism and cognitive impairment.^1 "
gastrointestinal system,489,A patient with ulcerative colitis is found to have deranged LFTs with particularly elevated bilirubin and gamma glutamyltransferase.  He is complaining of pruritus.  On examination he appears jaundice and there is hepatomegaly.  Bloods reveal positive ANCA.  What investigation is most useful in confirming the diagnosis?,Anti smooth muscle antibodies,MRCP,Liver biopsy,ERCP,Ultrasound,B,Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a chronic disorder characterised by inflammation an fibrosis of intra and extrahepatic ducts.  In over 75% of cases of PSC is there associated inflammatory bowel disease usually ulcerative colitis.  It typically presents as above or is found incidentally.  It is associated with ANCA in about 60% of cases and is thought to indicate a more severe course.  In PBC and AIH you would expect other autoantibodies to be elevated.  Ultrasound may show dilated intra and extra hepatic ducts however MRCP and ERCP if intervention is planned is useful for the diagnosis.  MRCP is being more frequently used as it is non invasive compared to ERCP. Liver biopsy may be required for staging of the disease. Ursodeoxycholic acid is utilised in the management and improves cholestasis.  Balloon dilatation and stent insertion may be required to relieve symptoms. Liver transplantation is required when there is significant cirrhosis. The biggest concern is the development of cholangiocarcinoma and it is thought that alcohol consumption may exacerbate this risk.
gastrointestinal system,490,A 40-year-old woman complains of dysphagia for both solids and liquids. She sometimes suffers from severe retrosternal chest pain. Barium swallow reveals a dilated esophagus which tapers to a fine distal end. What is the best management strategy?,Reassurance,Antispasmodics,Dilatation of the LES,Endoscopic diverticulectomy,Barium swallow,C,Dysphagia for both solids and liquids suggest neuromuscular dysphagia while dysphagia only for solid suggests mechanical obstruction. Here features are consistent with achalasia for which lower oesophageal sphincter dilation (balloon dilatation) is a treatment modality
gastrointestinal system,491,"A 26 year old female presents with fatigue, myalgia and pruritus.  She is complaining of vague right upper quadrant pain and has noticed her skin and eyes appearing yellow in colour.  On examination there is evidence of hepatomegaly and jaundice. Bloods reveal deranged LFTs (predominantly raised aminotransferases), a normocytic anaemia, elevated IgGs and anti LKM antibodies.  Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment should be commenced?",Ursodeoxycholic acid,Prednisolone,Ciclosporin,Azathioprine,Colestyramine,B,"The most likely diagnosis is autoimmune hepatitis. Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic disease where there is hepatocellular inflammation and necrosis which can lead onto to cirrhosis. It typically presents as in this case and type 2 autoimmune hepatitis tends to effect younger individuals and children and is associated with LKM1 autoantibodies.  In type 2 there is often other autoimmune diseases associated such as inflammatory bowel disease, ITP, graves disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and many more.  In type 1 autoimmune hepatitis there is ANA, anti smooth muscle antibodies and raised IgG.  It is less often associated with other disease.  Liver biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis and staging.  The mainstay of the management of AIH is corticosteroids with or without azathioprine.  Ciclosporin can be utilised if this fails.  Liver transplantation may ultimately be required and prognosis is good.  Ursodeoxycholic acid is utilised in PBC."
gastrointestinal system,492,Which of the following is true regarding carcinoma of the stomach?,Adenomatous polyps may predispose to malignant change,Duodenal involvement occurs in 75-80% of all gastric carcinomas,Incidence is higher in the UK than in Japan,Resection requires preservation of the greater omentum,Symptoms in early gastric cancer do not improve with acid-reducing treatment,A,"The most common neoplasm of the stomach is an adenocarcinoma. Japan has the highest age-adjusted incidence and death rate followed by Chile, Austria and Finland. It is highest in social classes III-V, more common in blood group A (in the UK; Group B in Japan), and associated with increased ingestion of nitrates, smoked fish, spicy food and Helicobacter pylori infection. The incidence of malignant transformation from adenomatous polyps is 18-75%. The first symptoms of gastric cancer are those of:  Dyspepsia Epigastric pain Vomiting Dysphagia, and Bleeding.  These symptoms are sometimes impossible to distinguish from benign peptic ulceration and symptoms in early gastric cancer may, in fact, settle down with acid-reducing treatment (the temptation to treat patients medically for prolonged periods of time without confirmation of the diagnosis should therefore be resisted). Gastric cancer may spread luminally into the duodenum and oesophagus. It is not true that the pylorus is the invariable limit of distal spread since duodenal involvement occurs in 25-30% of all gastric cancers. Along with partial/total gastrectomy, the greater omentum is removed in all cases along with the left gastric, celiac and common hepatic nodes."
gastrointestinal system,493,"A man post-cholecystectomy presented with jaundice, fever and dark urine. What is the most diagnostic investigation?",ERCP,USG Abdomen,CT Scan,MRCP,MRI,A,"Post operative US will not give good results. We shall not go for ercp first as it has complications like injury and pancreatitis. Acceptable options are CT, MRI and MRCP among which most appropriate is MRCP! But as the Question wants most diagnostic it is ERCP. The diagnosis here is choledocolithiasis with cholangitis"
gastrointestinal system,494,A 50-year-old former footballer with a long history of alcohol excess presents with epigastric pain. Which of the following suggests a diagnosis of peptic ulceration rather than chronic pancreatitis?,Back pain,Exacerbation with alcohol,Loose stool,Relieved by food,Weight loss,D,"Relief with food suggests peptic, and specifically, duodenal ulceration. It is likely that food would precipitate the pain of chronic pancreatitis. Loose stool is suggestive of pancreatitis/malabsorption. Pain referred to the back occurs in both situations and hence not suggestive. Weight loss can occur in both gastric ulcers and pancreatitis and is not very suggestive. Alcohol may well exacerbate both types of pain."
gastrointestinal system,495,Which one of the following require urgent referral for upper endoscopy?,A 35-year-old male who has a history of waterbrash and dyspepsia which has responded to a course of ranitidine but since stopping has recurred,A 45-year-old male with a one month history of persistent dyspepsia,A 56-year-old male with a one month history of dyspepsia and a pulsatile central abdominal mass,"A 62-year-old male with a three month history of unexplained weight loss, tenesmus and a right abdominal mass",A 73-year-old male with a three month history of dyspepsia which has failed to respond to a course of proton pump inhibitors,E,"Criteria for referral for urgent endoscopy include  Dysphagia (at any age) Dyspepsia at any age combined with any one of weight loss, anaemia or vomiting Dyspepsia in a patient aged 55 or above with onset of dyspepsia within one year and persistent symptoms Dyspepsia with one of Barrett's oesophagus, family history of upper gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoma, pernicious anaemia or upper GI surgery more than 20 years ago Jaundice Abdominal mass.  With regard to the presented cases, the 56-year-old man has dyspepsia with what seems to be an aortic aneurysm. This requires an ultrasound and vascular opinion. In the case of unexplained weight loss, tenesmus and upper right mass the problem is likely to be a colonic carcinoma."
gastrointestinal system,496,"A patient presents with longstanding gastric reflux, dysphagia and chest pain. On barium enema, dilation of esophagus with tapering end is noted. He was found with Barrett’s esophagus. He had progressive dysphagia to solids and then liquids. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?",Achalasia,Esophageal spasm,GERD,Barrett’s esophagus,Esophageal carcinoma,E,there is dilatation in oesophagus which is seen both in achalasia and carcinoma. Dysphagia to solid initaially is very much suggestive of carcinoma and also barrett’s change is a clue to carcinoma
gastrointestinal system,497,A woman who returned from abroad after 3 weeks of holiday complains of severe diarrhea of 3 weeks. She also developed IDA (Iron Deficiency Anaemia) and folic acid deficiency. What condition best describes her situation?,Jejunal villous atrophy,Chronic diarrhea secretions,Malabsorption,Increased catabolism,Increased secretions of acid,C,"Acute gastroenteritis (may be due to bacteria, virus or parasite) may cause transient malabsorption, probably as a result of temporary, superficial damage to the villi and microvilli"
gastrointestinal system,498,"A 38-year-old woman presents with a recent history of pruritus, fatigue, and jaundice. Liver biopsy revealed periportal fibrosis with periportal inflammation and prominent enlargement of the portal tracts. Which one of the following antibodies is most likely to be found in the blood?",Anticardiolipin,Anticentromere,Antimitochondrial,Antimyeloperoxidase,Antinuclear,C,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a slowly progressive autoimmune disease of the liver that primarily affects women in their fifth decade. It is characterised by portal inflammation and immune-mediated destruction of the intrahepatic bile ducts which results in reduced bile secretion and retention of toxic substances. This leads to further hepatic damage, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. Serologically, PBC is characterised by antimitochondrial antibodies, which are present in 90-95% of patients (often before clinical signs develop) and have a specificity of 98%. These antibodies are specific for the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and it is unclear why they affect only the liver when all nucleated cells contain mitochondria. Twin and family studies suggest there is a significant genetic predisposition. Treatment is empirical and patients may go on to require a liver transplant. Anticardiolipin antibodies are most commonly associated with antiphospholipid syndrome which increases the risk of thrombosis. Anticentromere antibodies are associated with limited systemic sclerosis. Myeloperoxidase is the antigen which p-ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies) targets. It is associated with a number of vasculitides but most classically microscopic polyangiitis. Antinuclear antibodies are associated with 80-90% of cases of systemic lupus erythematosus but are also found with Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic sclerosis, and polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. "
gastrointestinal system,499,"A 64-year-old man presents to the hospital with bleeding. He has a heavy dependence on alcohol. On examination, he has petechiae and bleeding gums. What is the likely vitamin deficiency?",B1,B12,C,E,K,C,"Alcoholics have malabsorption resulting in multiple possible vitamin deficiencies. Vitamin C deficiency, or scurvy, results in perifollicular haemorrhages and bleeding gums. Vitamin C, also known as ascoric acid, is found in fruit and vegetables, milk, fish, and offal. It cannot be synthesised by the body and, as such, is an essential dietary vitamin. It is used for collagen formation, which maintains the integrity of skin and connective tissues, bone, vessels and dentition. It also facilitates the absorption of iron. Chronic, severe deficiency, which can occur in alcoholics, results in scurvy. Early symptoms are non-specific such as malaise and lethargy. This can progress to dyspnoea, arthralgia, and myalgia. Ecchymoses, perifollicular haemorrhages, purpura, splinter haemorrhages, petechiae, and poor wound healing then becomes apparent. In addition, there can be conjunctival haemorrhages, flame-shaped retinal haemorrhages and cotton wool spots can be seen. In the late stages jaundice, oedema, fractures, cardiac failure, neuropathy, and seizures can occur. Deficiencies in:  B1 or thiamine can result in Wernicke's encephalopathy Vitamin B12 or cyanocobalamin can result in subacute degeneration of the spinal cord Vitamin K can result in anticoagulant effects and elevated INR causing more profuse bleeding Vitamin E deficiency can result in myopathies, neuropathies and red cell dyscrasias."
gastrointestinal system,500,An 18 year old notices that whenever he has a cold or flu he becomes jaundice. The urine is not dark. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Gilberts syndrome,Haemolytic anaemia,Dubin Johnson syndrome,Gallstone,Haemochromatosis,A,"Gilberts syndrome is whereby there is a reduced activity of glucuronyltransferase activity which leads to a mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. This can be trigger by infection, certain drugs and fasting. Dubin Johnson syndrome is much rarer and leads to conjugated bilirubin rise. As it is conjugated this leads to dark urine."
gastrointestinal system,501,A 34-year-old man with ulcerative colitis is admitted with severe bloody diarrhoea. He is opening his bowels approximately 15 times a day and has abdominal pain. His current medication includes Mezavant and on admission he is commenced on intravenous hydrocortisone. You are asked to request a thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) level as the plan is to start azathioprine at a later date. What percentage of the population has normal or high TPMT activity?,1%,10%,25%,50%,90%,E,"Ninety per cent of the population have normal or high enzyme activity, that is, are homozygous for the wild-type allele. The enzyme activity of thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) is under the control of a genetic polymorphism. Ten per cent of the population have intermediate levels of TPMT activity, that is, one wild-type and one variant allele. One in 300 people have no functional enzyme activity. Several groups of patients - not only those with inflammatory bowel disease - have developed azathioprine induced myelosuppression linked to TPMT deficiency. "
gastrointestinal system,502,"A 20-year-old man was found to have iron deficiency anaemia when he went to donate blood. The Blood Transfusion Service contacted his general practitioner who referred the patient to the outpatient clinic for further investigation. Generally, the patient was very well. He had a good appetite, his weight was steady and he ate a normal diet. He had a normal bowel habit and had never passed any blood, mucus or diarrhoea in his stools. The patient denied knowledge of any overt blood loss from any other source. His general practitioner had organised an open access endoscopy which was normal; duodenal biopsies were unremarkable. He had a limited knowledge of his family history as his mother had died in childbirth and as a result he was an only child. His father had died of what he thought was secondary liver and lung cancer but he was unsure. On general physical examination he was fit and athletic. The skin and mucosal membranes were unremarkable. Pulse was 70 beats per minute and regular with a blood pressure of 132/78 mmHg. Heart sounds were normal and the chest was clear. His abdomen was soft and non-tender with no palpable masses or organs. Rectal examination was normal. On viewing the rectal mucosa through a rigid sigmoidoscope the colonic mucosa was covered in innumerable polyps. What specific genetic abnormality is responsible for this appearance?",Germline mutation of the STK11 gene on chromosome 19,Homozygous mutation of the MYH gene,Loss of the APC gene on chromosome 5,Mutations in mismatch repair genes (e.g. MSH2),Mutation of the p53 tumour suppressor gene,C,"The patient will need a full colonoscopy and biopsy but the information presented is highly suggestive of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), caused by the loss of the APC gene on the long arm of chromosome 5. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant inherited disorder caused by a germline mutation of the STK11 (serine threonine kinase 11) gene, usually located on the long arm of chromosome 19. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is associated with intestinal hamartomatous polyps, but is usually (90%) associated with peri-oral pigmentation. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) and MYC polyposis do not cause multiple polyps as suggested in this case. In HNPCC, affected individuals inherit a mutation in one of several genes involved in DNA mismatch repair, including MSH2, MLH1, and PMS2. Homozygous mutations in the MYH gene have been associated with a phenotype of multiple colorectal adenomas with or without cancer. This accounts for a proportion of FAP patients without a pathogenic APC mutation. Mutations in the p53 tumour suppressor gene are found in many different cancers. While mutations in p53 are seen in cases of colon cancer, the question asks for the specific mutation associated with polyposis coli. The main differential in this question is between FAP and PJS but the lack of perioral pigmentation favours FAP as the diagnosis."
gastrointestinal system,503,Which of the following is a cause of primary iron overload?,Alcoholic liver disease,Aplastic anaemia,Haemochromatosis,Insulin resistance syndrome,Repeated blood transfusions,C,"Haemochromatosis is the correct answer. The remaining options are all associated with secondary iron overload. Iron overload secondary to repeated blood transfusion is a particular problem for patients with hereditary anaemia, and can be a major cause of morbidity. The association between the metabolic syndrome (insulin resistance,obesity, hyperlipidaemia) and the development of hepatic iron overload has been described on a number of occasions over the last couple of decades. These patients are usually middle-aged men with mild to moderate iron excess. It is thought compound heterozygosity for the HFE mutations (C282Y and H63D) may have a role, but the link is not yet fully understood. Aplastic anaemia is often associated with chronic haemolysis, and repeated blood transfusions, both of which are linked with iron overload. Following heavy alcohol intake, hepatocytes may lose their ability to compensate for inborn errors in iron metabolism, resulting in iron overload. The link between iron and alcohol is further demonstrated by the fact that alcohol increases the severity of liver damage in hereditary haemochromatosis. "
gastrointestinal system,504,A 65-year-old male presents with a four-month history of diarrhoea with pale stools and weight loss. Relevant results show:    Calcium 1.8 mmol/L (2.2-2.6)   Alkaline phosphatase 350 U/L (45-105)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Coeliac disease,Giardia lamblia infection,Pancreatic carcinoma,Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth,Whipple’s disease,C,"The patient has a marked hypocalcaemia associated with malabsorption. A lack of pancreatic enzymes results in increased fats in the small intestine, leading to sequestration of calcium and malabsorption of calcium as a consequence. The raised alkaline phosphatase may represent osteomalacia, pancreatic carcinoma in its own right, metastases, or even biliary obstruction/disease. At this age pancreatic carcinoma is the most probable diagnosis. Coeliac disease very seldom causes such an increased alkaline phosphatase and is more likely to present with iron deficiency anaemia. The villous atrophy caused by Giardia is very transient. Whipple's is extremely rare, found in middle-aged men and caused by a bacillus, Tropheryma whippelii."

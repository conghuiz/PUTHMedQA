infectious diseases,1,"A 30-year-old man developed a febrile illness three days after returning from a holiday in Thailand. He was admitted complaining of severe myalgia. On examination, he was febrile (39°C) with a diffuse macular rash on the trunk. There was no lymphadenopathy. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 151 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 7.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 105 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum total bilirubin 18 µmol/L (1-22)   Serum alanine aminotransferase 120 U/L (5-35)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute HIV infection (seroconversion illness),Dengue fever,Hepatitis E,Secondary syphilis,Typhoid,B,"The symptoms are most consistent with dengue fever. While acute retroviral syndrome (acute HIV) is associated with a widespread macular rash, it is also usually associated with pharyngitis and generalised lymphadenopathy. Hepatitis E presents in a similar manner to hepatitis A, that is, as an acute febrile illness with jaundice. The history is too acute for secondary syphilis, which is not typically associated with myalgia. Typhoid fever is usually a diarrhoeal illness associated with subtle 'rose spots' on the abdomen. Dengue fever is caused by an arthropod-borne Flavivirus. The disease has an incubation period of approximately seven days, followed by headaches and retro-orbital pain. Symptoms evolve rapidly and severe musculoskeletal pain is a prominent feature, with a maculopapular rash."
infectious diseases,2,"A 43-year-old woman develops a progressive, ascending motor weakness over several days. She is hospitalised and requires intubation with mechanical ventilation. She is afebrile. A lumbar puncture is performed with normal opening pressure and yields clear, colourless cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with normal glucose, increased protein, and cell count of 5/microlitre, all lymphocytes. She gradually recovers over the next month. Which of the following conditions most likely preceded the onset of her illness?",Ketoacidosis,Staphylococcus aureus septicaemia,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Viral pneumonia,Vitamin B12 deficiency,D,She has Guillain-Barré syndrome often preceded by an episode of infection such as viral (cytomegalovirus [CMV]) or bacterial (Campylobacter).
infectious diseases,3,A sexually active female presents to a GU clinic with multiple painful genital ulcers. What is the likeliest cause?,Chlamydia trachomatis,Herpes simplex,Haemophilus ducreyi,Primary HIV infection,Treponema pallidum,B,"Herpes simplex is a sexually transmitted disease and the commonest cause of multiple painful genital lesions. C. trachomatis and T. pallidum do not normally cause painful genital ulceration. H. ducreyi does cause painful genital ulcers, however, there is usually only a single ulcer present and it is much less common than Herpes simplex in the United Kingdom. It remains highly prevalent in areas of Africa. Compared to herpes simplex, primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is an unusual cause of genital ulceration."
infectious diseases,4,A 34-year-old man from Zimbabwe is admitted with abdominal pain to the emergency department. An abdominal X-ray reveals bladder calcification. What is the most likely cause?,Schistosoma mansoni,Sarcoidosis,Leishmaniasis,TB,Schistosoma hematobium,E,Bladder involvement is caused by Schistosoma hematobium while Schistosoma mansoni causes intestinal disease
infectious diseases,5,"A 72-year-old man presents to the tuberculosis clinic. He has a 6-month history of lower back pain that has been gradually getting worse. He has tried taking analgesia, but this is now no longer helping the pain and he is becoming less able to mobilise. He lives with his wife on their farm. He has been fully independent until his recent deterioration in mobility. Past medical history includes: hypertension, diet controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and benign prostatic hypertrophy. He reports that he had tuberculosis when he was 24, but this was treated. He can't remember what he was treated with. An MRI spine shows an L4/5 discitis and a biopsy of this tissue is arranged. Acid-fast bacilli are grown on culture of the biopsy. What treatment regime should be started?","2 months of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol with a further 4 months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin","2 months of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol with a further 7 months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin","3 months of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol with a further 6 months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin","6 months of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol","6 months of Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol with a further 6 months of Isoniazid and Rifampicin",A,Treatment for bone and joint tuberculosis is recommended to continue for 2 months with the initial phase consisting of quadruple therapy and the remaining 4 months as dual therapy. It is recommended not to extend treatment for residual complications such as collapsed discs or bending of the spine. 
infectious diseases,6,A young girl returns from a trip to India with a protracted history of watery diarrhoea. Giardiasis is suspected but three stool samples are negative. What is the best investigation to confirm Giardia as a diagnosis?,CT abdomen,Rectal biopsy,Serum IgM Giardia antibodies,Small intestine biopsy,Stool microscopy,D,"Current evidence is that initial investigation for Giardia is microscopy of three stool samples. However, if repeated stool samples are negative and symptoms continue, current NHS guidelines suggest that endoscopy is the best way to confirm the diagnosis. Samples from this can demonstrate the parasite. Some laboratories are now using stool antigen tests, but this is not widely available and is usually only used during a suspected outbreak. Serum antibody tests, in contrast, will only be able to tell if there has been exposure to the infection not necessarily active infection. There are no findings on rectal biopsy or CT abdomen which are specific to Giardia."
infectious diseases,7,Which of the following concerning Corynebacterium diphtheriae is correct?,Can cause skin infection,Infection is often complicated by myocardial fibrosis after recovery from severe infection,Is most unlikely to cause infection in an individual with a positive Schick test,Mitis strain is generally more virulent than the intermedius strain,Toxin is better absorbed through the anterior nasal than the pharyngeal mucosa,A,"Corynebacterium diphtheriae is a Gram positive, non-spore-forming, pleomorphic bacteria that is also a facultative anaerobe. It causes diphtheria in humans. There are three recognised strains of C.diphtheria: gravis, intermedius, and mitis. Intermedius is thought to be the one most associated with the exotoxin and is more virulent than the mitis strain. Diphtheria is transmitted from person to person, with human beings the main reservoir. The Schick test involves the intradermal injection of a small amount of diphtheria toxin into the arm of a person. If positive a wheal develops, which indicates the patient is susceptible to diphtheria. It is no longer used in routine clinical practice in the UK. Typically, diphtheria attacks the respiratory system, but may also affect the skin, conjunctiva, and external genitalia. Signs and symptoms include sore throat, fever, and swelling of lymph nodes in the neck and general malaise. As the disease progresses, diphtheria toxin is secreted. This destroys the membrane surface of the affected areas and replaces them with a greyish, tough, leathery andquot;pseudomembraneandquot; made of dead tissue, leukocytes, and bacteria. The classical signs which may be described in examination questions include the dense grey pseudomembrane, which can occur in any portion of the respiratory tract (characteristically the posterior pharynx) and a 'bulls neck' which results from cervical lymphadenopathy and mucosal swelling. Cutaneous diphtheria presents with non-healing ulcers covered with a grey membrane, which can develop bacterial co-infection. If isolated, the disease is indolent, but the ulcers can act as a reservoir which can subsequently lead to pharyngeal infection. Anterior nasal diphtheria usually presents in a similar fashion to the common cold, as absorption of the toxin here is minimal. Pharyngeal, tonsillar, and laryngeal diphtheria results in higher absorption of toxin into the bloodstream and therefore more severe manifestations. If absorbed systemically, the toxin can also affect the heart, nerves, and other organs in the body causing heart failure, nerve damage, or suffocation. Cardiac involvement is usually in the form of a cardiomyopathy and myositis, which is evident from the 10-14th day and may lead to arrhythmias. This accounts for 50% of deaths, but myocardial fibrosis affects a minority infected with diphtheria. Management of suspected cases should include isolation, securing a definitive airway, cardiac monitoring, and erythromycin or penicillin promptly. Antitoxin is available in the USA. Diphtheria is a notifiable disease in the UK. "
infectious diseases,8,A 36-year-old lady who is an intravenous drug user has had weight loss for the past 4 months. He now presents with drowsiness and increasing confusion. What is the single most likely cause?,Cryptococcus infection,Toxoplasmosis,Pneumocystis carinii,Cryptosporidium,Herpes zoster,A,Case of HIV. Cryptococcus can causes meningitis in AIDS patients
infectious diseases,9,What is the most common cause of an outbreak of diarrhoea and vomiting in a hospital setting?,Clostridium difficile,Rota virus,Norovirus,Staph. Aureus,B. Cereus,C,Norovirus is an RNA virus and accounts for approximately 90% of epidemic viral gastroenteritis. It is common in the hospital setting.
infectious diseases,10,A 25-year-old male presents with fever malaise and lethargy two weeks after visiting family in India. A blood film for malaria parasites is reported as negative. What is the next most appropriate investigation?,Blood culture,Chest x ray,Interferon gamma releasing assay (IGRA),Urine culture,Widal test,A,"After malaria, enteric fevers are important to exclude. Blood cultures are the most important investigation for enteric fevers caused by Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi. The Widal test, a demonstration of agglutinating antibodies against somatic O and flagella H antigen of Salmonella species is non-specific and, therefore, less reliable."
infectious diseases,11,"A 19 year old back packer returns from central America. She presents with a one week history of severe headache, fever, myalgia and a rash. The rash is a maculopapular rash which began on her wrists and ankles and has gradually spread to the trunk. In some areas there is evidence of petechiae. She remembers being bitten by a tick whilst on holiday. What is the most likely causative agent?",Plasmodium falciparum,Rickettsia rickettsii,Salmonella Typhi,Rickettsia prowazekki,Rickettsia typhi,B,"This history is highly indicative of Rocky mounatin spotted fever. It can present similarly to Epidemic typhus howver the rash begins peripherally and not centrally. It is caused by rickettsia rickettsii. It is transmitted by the ticks, Dermacentor variabilis and D. andersoni. The classic triad is fever, headache and the rash described. It begins as maculopapular and then can become petechial or purpuric. It can present more severely with neurological manifestations such as meningoencephalitis, pneumonia or GI manifestations. Diagnosis is confirmed with serological testing. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. R. prowazekki causes epidemic typhus, rickettsia typhi murine typhus and salmonella typhi thyphoid fever."
infectious diseases,12,"A 36 year old gentleman presents with fatigue, weight loss, abdominal discomfort, nausea and change in bowel habit.  On examination there is a right iliac fossa mass.  A colonoscopy is organised and a biopsy taken which reveals gram positive filamentous rods and sulphur granules.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Colorectal Cancer,Actinomycosis,Crohn's Disease,Appendicitis,Giardiasis,B,"Cervicofacial actinomycosis is the most common manifestation of actinomyces infection.  This is a gram positive branching bacteria which are found as normal mouth and intestinal commensals.  It typically leads to non painful swelling with sinus formation with discharge of sulphur granules which is characteristic.  It can affect the GI tract and lead to fever, weight loss, change in bowel habit and nausea and vomiting.  It typically leads to a firm right iliac fossa mass.  These can cause sinus formation to the abdominal wall or perianal region.  It can be confused with Crohns and malignancy however a biopsy reveals pus with sulphur containing granules provides the definitive diagnosis."
infectious diseases,13,A patient presents with genital warts wishing treatment. On examination there is several small warts on the penis and under the foreskin. These are soft and accessible. What treatment would you recommend?,Podophyllotoxin 0.5% liquid,Cryotherapy,Podophyllotoxin 0.15% cream,Imiquimod,Topical aciclovir,C,"Podophyllotoxin is a useful first line treatment for soft accessible warts. It can be applied at home and has a clearance rate of about 40 to 60%. It can cause irritation and systemic toxicity if used in excessive amounts. It this fails a higher dose of the liquid or imiquimod as a a second line agent. If there a small number of warts then cryotherapy may be utilised. Laser therapy, electrotherapy and surgical excision are other options."
infectious diseases,14,"A 26-year-old previously healthy woman has a sudden onset of mental confusion. She has a seizure and is brought to the hospital. Her vital signs show blood pressure 100/60 mmHg, temperature 37°C, pulse 89, and respirations 22. A lumbar puncture reveals a normal opening pressure, and clear, colourless cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obtained with 1 RBC and 20 WBCs (all lymphocytes), with normal glucose and protein. An MRI scan reveals swelling of the right temporal lobe with haemorrhagic areas. Which of the following infectious agents is the most likely cause for these findings?",Haemophilus influenzae,Herpes simplex virus,Influenza virus,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Neisseria meningitidis,B,"Haemorrhagic lesions of the temporal lobe are typical for Herpes simplex virus infection. Haemophilus influenzae is the organism most associated with meningitis in children. Neisseria meningitidis would cause meningitis - however, in this case there are lymphocytes not neutrophils in the CSF and a normal, not low, glucose."
infectious diseases,15,A 42-year-old restaurateur who has been human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive for eight years presents with progressive shortness of breath on exercise. The chest x ray shows normal lung fields with prominent pulmonary arteries. Pulse oximetry demonstrates that he desaturates on exercise. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Anaemia,Intracardiac shunt across an atrial septal defect,Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP),Primary pulmonary hypertension,Pulmonary embolic disease,C,"The history of dyspnoea and desaturation on exercise in an HIV-positive patient would suggest PCP. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a eukaryotic microorganism. In immunosuppressed patients, it can cause pneumonia which is most recognised in patients with AIDS but can also be seen in those with organ transplants or when undergoing chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 is associated with significant risk. In Europe, the USA and Australia P. jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients is seen largely in those unaware of their HIV status. Unfortunately, it is a major cause of death in Africa, especially in children. Previously it was thought that disease was caused by reactivation of latent infection acquired in childhood, but de novo infection is increasingly recognised. Pneumonia caused by P. jiroveci is potentially severe and fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Clinically it presents with several weeks' history of dry cough, fever and dyspnoea. Examination findings are often subtle but include tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and fine respiratory crackles. Typically, patients desaturate markedly on exertion. There may be reduced transfer factor, vital capacity and total lung capacity on spirometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum can be used to demonstrate the organism (open lung biopsy is gold standard, but rarely performed in clinical practice). Giemsa, Papanicolaou and Grocott's stains are used. There are a variety of different chest radiograph findings. Typically it causes bilateral symmetrical perihilar reticular or granular interstitial shadowing. Less often there can be asymmetric shadowing or progression to a reticular-alveolar pattern. Occasionally lobar consolidation, nodular lesions, prominent pulmonary arteries, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, cysts or pneumatoceles can be seen. In patients who have been on prophylactic inhaled pentamidine, the infiltrates may predominantly affect the upper lobes. A normal chest x ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not typical, but be aware of the possibility of multiple disease processes in an immunosuppressed patient. If allowed to progress, P.jiroveci can disseminate via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes to affect the thyroid, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. If PCP is suspected, treatment with full dose co-trimoxazole should be started as soon as possible. It should be given for 21 days in HIV-positive cases, but shorter doses can be used in other causes of immunosuppression. In patients who are intolerant of co-trimoxazole, intravenous pentamidine can be used. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids can reduce the risk of respiratory failure, and they are therefore used in some cases. Prophylaxis should be used in immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of developing PCP: all those with a CD4 count of less than200, patients started on high dose steroids and those on chemotherapeutic regimens associated with significant immunosuppression. Co-trimoxazole is also a first line prophylactic agent. Pulmonary hypertension does develop with increased frequency in patients with HIV, but this is secondary rather than primary. Primary pulmonary hypertension is rare, and more commonly affects females. Anaemia is a possibility, but the chest x ray findings and history of HIV make PCP more likely. Atrial septal defects with intracardiac shunting can eventually lead to hypoxia (Eisenmenger syndrome), but this is less likely than PCP in patients known to be HIV-positive. This history may also be consistent with multiple small pulmonary emboli, but again this is less likely than PCP in an HIV-positive patient. "
infectious diseases,16,"A 19-year-old male student attends the Emergency Department complaining of an urethral discharge one week after having casual unprotected sex. Gram stain shows numerous neutrophils, some of which contain Gram negative intracellular Diplococci. The patient is treated with ceftriaxone, 250 mg as an intramuscular injection. Five days later, the patient re-attends with persisting discharge. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this discharge?",Chlamydia trachomatis,Penicillin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Re-infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Ureaplasma urealyticum,Urethral stricture,A,"Gonorrhoea is one of the commonest reported STDs in both men and women. In men, the symptoms manifest as urethritis and in women cervicitis or urethritis. This patient has been adequately treated for gonorrhoea and a persistent discharge would be unusual unless there is antibiotic resistance in which case a culture assay will help to determine sensitivities. More commonly patients present with co-infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. In this case, the patient is likely to have a non-specific urethritis (NSU) due to Chlamydia trachomatis, requiring treatment with either doxycycline or erythromycin for 7-14 days."
infectious diseases,17,"A patient who came from India presents with cough, fever and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Examinations: caseating granulomata found in lymph nodes. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?",Lymphoma,TB adenitis,Thyroid carcinoma,Goiter,Thyroid cyst,B,"Cough, fever, and cervical lymphadenopathy following travel to India makes the likely diagnosis of TB. Also caseating granulomata are diagnostic of TB"
infectious diseases,18,"A 47-year-old woman presents with high fever, rigours, and myalgia. Nasal aspirate is positive for influenza virions. Which of the following is true of her B cell response?",Affinity maturation takes place in the blood stream,Deficiency of either CD40 or CD40L still allows an IgG response,Her B cells express immunoglobulin on their surface,Memory cells are not formed as repeated infections with influenza often occur,The antibody response to the virus does not require T cell help,C,"B cells usually require T cell help for full activation. B cells activated in the primary immune response initially produce IgM. With continuing T cell help, B cells then undergo heavy chain class switching and enter germinal centres in secondary lymphoid organs. The germinal centres are the sites of immunoglobulin affinity maturation and memory B cell formation. Various factors including the nature of T cell help, antigen exposure site and cytokine profile, determine the isotype of heavy chain produced. CD40 and CD40L are required for co-stimulation by T cells. Deficiency of either CD40 or CD40L impairs class switching. Certain antigens, thymus thymus-independent antigen, can activate B cells in the absence of T cell help. T cell independent B cell responses are mainly to carbohydrate antigen, for example, pneumococcal polysaccharide. These antigens are not processed and presented in association with MHC molecules, and therefore cannot activate T helper cells. Most TI antigens have highly repetitive epitopes (for example, LPS/endotoxin), which are able to cross link B cell surface immunoglobulin and activate these cells. Some T cell independent antigens can cause proliferation of B cells regardless of their specificity: polyclonal B cell activation. B cell responses to T independent antigens consist mainly of IgM antibodies of low affinity without the production of memory cells. The influenza virus will activate T and B cells, and result in memory cell production. Genetic mutation in the virus is responsible for immune evasion and repeated infections."
infectious diseases,19,"In lyme disease, which complication is most likely to lead to collapse?",Dilated CM,AV block,Mild encephalitis,Meningitis,Myocarditis,B,"Cardiac complications of Lyme disease generally occur in the early phase and include conduction system disturbances, myopericarditis and congestive heart failure"
infectious diseases,20,What is the mechanism of resistance for rifampicin resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,Alteration in cell wall permeability,Alteration of penicillin binding proteins (PBPs),Alteration of the DNA dependent RNA transcriptase,Efflux mechanism,Production of the inactivating enzyme penicillinase,C,Rifampicin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic which acts by inhibiting protein synthesis. Mutations in rpoB gene cause alterations in the bacterial DNA dependent RNA transcriptase which prevents the binding of rifampicin.
infectious diseases,21,"A 75 year old woman, with dementia and poor mobility, from a nursing home is found to have gonorrhoea. How should this be managed?",Nil,IM ceftriaxone,Contact nursing home,Discuss with senior and likely police involvement,Investigate for chlamydia,D,If a patient from a nursing home is discovered to have an STI then you must discuss this with a senior physician. Although there may be a feasible explanation this may be an indication of abuse and may have to be investigated by the police.
infectious diseases,22,"A 29-year-old junior doctor comes to the Emergency department complaining of a severe headache and neck stiffness. He has had mild diarrhoea over the past few days, and some coryzal symptoms. On examination his BP is 155/82 mmHg, his pulse is 85 and regular and his temperature is 37.8℃. He has signs consistent with severe meningism but there are no skin rashes or other signs of vasculitis. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 138 g/L (135-177)   White cells 8.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet 183 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 92 µmol/L (79-118)    Lumbar puncture - lymphocytosis, slightly raised protein, normal glucose. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cytomegalovirus meningitis,Enterovirus meningitis,Herpes simplex encephalitis,Meningococcal meningitis,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,B,"The answer is Enterovirus meningitis. Enterovirus is the commonest cause of viral meningitis in the adult population. The corizal symptoms coupled with a mild diarrhoeal illness fit with this picture, as do the lumbar puncture findings. Management of viral meningitis is conservative, with adequate hydration and analgesia."
infectious diseases,23,A 40-year-old farmer presented to the Emergency Department with a 24-hour history of fever and increasing confusion. On examination he was febrile 39.5°C. A generalised erythematous rash covering most of his body was observed. He also had a paronychial infection of his right index finger with lymphangitis extending caudally and with axillary lymphadenopathy. His heart rate was measured at 120 beats per minute with a blood pressure of 80/60 mmHg. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Hantavirus infection,Leptospirosis,Orf,Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome,Stevens-Johnson syndrome,D,"The history is typical of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS):  shock fever confusion, and rash.  The primary source of infection, in this case, is the paronychia of his right index finger. Hantavirus infections (viral zoonoses transmitted via rodents) typically have two distinct presentations, either:  as a haemorrhagic fever with renal failure, or as an acute pulmonary syndrome.  The former manifestation is commonest in the Far East and Eastern Europe, while the latter is the predominant form in the southwestern United States and South America. Leptospirosis does not typically cause a rash and is often associated with jaundice; leptospirosis would not explain the lesion on his finger. Orf, a zoonotic infection caused by a pox virus, presents with painless ulcerated lesions on the hands of farmers but does not fully explain this clinical picture. Stevens-Johnson syndrome typically starts with an erythema multiforme-type rash that spreads widely and involves the buccal mucosa and conjunctivae, often caused by antibiotic therapy; but does not fit the clinical picture presented here."
infectious diseases,24,"A 45-year-old man returned from a two week trip in Zimbabwe. Fourteen days later he presented with fever, sore throat, headaches and a widespread maculopapular rash. On examination, there was generalised lymphadenopathy and a widespread maculopapular rash. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute HIV infection,Schistomsomiasis,Strongyloidiasis,Tick typhus,Typhoid fever,A,"It is essential to exclude acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in this case. Acute retroviral syndrome is said to occur in 60-80% of patients between two and 12 weeks following exposure to HIV. Typical symptoms include fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy and a widespread macular rash. The illness closely resembles infectious mononucleosis. During seroconversion it is likely that the HIV antibody test will be negative; the diagnosis is made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of peripheral blood for HIV ribonucleic acid (RNA); in acute HIV the viral load is very high. andquot;The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually 2-4 weeks, but the incubation may be as long as 10 months in rare cases^1,3. Typical symptoms in a review of 209 cases^2 included fever (96%), adenopathy (74%), pharyngitis (70%), rashandquot; "
infectious diseases,25,A 22 year old female presents to her GP with increased vaginal discharge. A high vaginal swab is taken for culture and microscopy reveals a monomorphic gram negative diplococci. What treatment should be given?,Ampicillin,Doxycycline,Azithromycin,IM ceftriaxone,Ciprofloxacin,D,IM ceftriaxone and oral cefixime are the management of choice due to the development of resistance. Azithromycin can also be utilised.
infectious diseases,26,"A 25-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department a few days after returning from a holiday to Greece for a stag party. He admits to unprotected sexual intercourse during the trip and now complains of pain on passing urine, pus-like uretheral discharge, and swelling/limitation of movement affecting his right knee. On examination his BP is 115/82 mmHg, pulse is 85 bpm and regular. A sample of urethral discharge is sent for microscopy, culture and sensitivity. Flexion of his right knee is limited to 30 degrees, there is erythema and an effusion. Gram stain of the urethral discharge reveals gram negative diplococci. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Amoxicillin oral for 7 days,Azithromycin single dose,Azithromycin and ceftriaxone IM single doses,Ceftriaxone IV for 48 hrs then oral ciprofloxacin,Ciprofloxacin oral for 7 days,D,"The answer is Ceftriaxone IV for 48 hours then oral ciprofloxacin. It is likely this patient has disseminated gonococcal infection, leading to monoarthritis affecting the right knee. As such IV therapy for at least 48 hours followed by oral antibiotics is the most appropriate way to manage his disease. The conventional single dose oral and IM approach is inadequate in this situation. If rapid improvement in the monoarthritis does not occur, then therapeutic drainage and washout may be considered. Amoxicillin and quinolones are no longer considered first line therapy for gonorrhoea because of the risk of resistance. Although azithromycin and ceftriaxone combination therapy is the preferred approach to uncomplicated infection, the monoarthritis prompts the IV approach here. Azithromycin high dose, (2 g), may be used as monotherapy, but tolerability is poor, and it may increase the propensity for resistance to develop long term. "
infectious diseases,27,Which of the following is true regarding varicella zoster infection?,Associated pneumonitis is equally common in smokers and non-smokers,Causes congenital limb deformity,Causes urinary incontinence,Gamma interferon is an effective treatment,Produces latent infection within the anterior horn cells,B,"Varicella zoster infection causes herpes zoster and chickenpox. Herpes zoster is due to reactivation of the virus lying dormant in the cells of dorsal root ganglion. Autonomic involvement can cause urinary retention. Pregnancy increases risk of pneumonitis. Chicken pox in the first and second trimester can produce a syndrome of skin scarring, hypoplastic limbs, eye and central nervous system impairments. Pneumonitis is uncommon in children with an incidence of 0.3% in immunocompetent adults. The risk is higher in smokers. Antiviral treatment includes aciclovir and vidabarine."
infectious diseases,28,"A 22-year-old car mechanic comes to see your nurse, the morning after a fight in a pub. He sustained a deep laceration to his knuckle, allegedly in self defence, from his assailant's tooth. After the wound is cleaned and he has received tetanus immunisation, which of the following antibiotic regimes would be most appropriate for this patient?",Co-amoxiclav oral,Doxycycline oral,Flucloxacillin oral,Penicillin G IM,Trimethoprim oral,A,"There is little research into this area but human bites are notorious for causing infection. This type of closed fist injury is very susceptible to deep infection because the tendon can be infected at the point of injury and then, when the hand relaxes, it slips back into its sheath and is impossible to clean fully. Broad spectrum antibiotics, typically co-amoxiclav, are used. The possibility of blood borne viruses should also be considered here, and he should be offered testing for hepatitis B, C and HIV if appropriate. In patients who are pencillin allergic, doxycycline plus metronidazole is a typical first choice regimen. Referral to Accident and Emergency for further assessment and management is usually indicated "
infectious diseases,29,"A 38-year-old male with a diagnosis of HIV presents with lethargy, confusion, personality change, and a seizure. CT shows multiple ring enhancing mass lesions in both cerebral hemispheres. Which of the following treatments is indicated?",Broad spectrum antibiotics,Corticosteroids,Ketoconazole,Pyrimethamine and sulfonamide,Rifampicin and pyrazinamide,D,"Cerebral Toxoplasma infection gives rise to multiple ring enhancing lesions on CT and MRI scanning. Multiple cerebral abscesses are commonly present, which may result in multifocal symptoms, including:  visual field deficits focal seizures aphasia hemiparesis or hemisensory deficits cranial nerve palsies, and cerebellar dysfunction.  Non-focal symptoms such as a confusional state or personality disorder may manifest initially, but focal symptoms eventually appear as the disease progresses."
infectious diseases,30,Which one of the following measures would be most effective in reducing transmission of E. coli O157:H7 during an outbreak of diarrhoea caused by this organism?,Drinking only boiled water,Ensuring that meat products are thoroughly cooked,Giving antibiotics to individuals who are positive for E. coli on stool culture,Hand washing before preparing food,Isolation of individuals with diarrhoea,D,Cattle are a major reservoir of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and contaminated meat is the most commonly implicated source of outbreaks. Raw meat should be separated from cooked and ready-to-eat food. Hands should be washed after handling raw meatand effective washing would be most effective in preventing spread. Antibiotics are not routinely indicated and patients should be educated on personal hygiene.
infectious diseases,31,A 15-year-old girl presents to the Emergency Department with abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhoea for the past three days. She has not travelled outside the UK in the previous 12 months. What is the most likely causative organism?,Campylobacter jejuni,Cryptosporidium parvum,Salmonella typhi,Shigella flexneri,Staphylococcus aureus,A,"Of the options given, Campylobacter is the most common cause of dysentery (bloody diarrhoea). It usually originates in raw and undercooked poultry, unpasteurised milk and contaminated water. The incubation period is typically 2-5 days. In addition to diarrhoea, it results in cramps, fever and vomiting which normally resolves over 2-10 days. Treatment is usually symptomatic (i.e. oral fluids). Antibiotics can be used in severe cases, early in the disease. Human cryptosporidiosis causes self-limited diarrhoeal illness in healthy individuals, mostly children; and severe prolonged diarrhoea in patients with AIDS. Transmission is via human-to-human fecal-oral contamination. Animals are the major reservoir and outbreaks have been associated with water supplies and public swimming pools, as the organism can survive despite being in chlorine. Constipation rather than diarrhoea is a symptom of typhoid. Shigella can cause dysentery, but the commonest form is Shigella sonnei, and most cases in the UK are associated with foreign travel. Staphylococcus aureus can cause a self-limiting gastroenteritis characterised by severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. However, it is self-limiting and patients recover within 8-24 hours."
infectious diseases,32,"A 28-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of a thin fishy smelling discharge. She does not however have any vaginal irritation, redness or itching. Despite using body wash and showering twice per day, she says the smell and discharge persists. She is in a stable relationship with her husband and has two young children. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial vaginosis,C. trachomatis,Herpes simplex infection,N. gonorrhoeae,T. vaginalis,A,"The answer is bacterial vaginosis. This woman is in a stable relationship, with a history of excess body washing, the history of clear discharge without irritation fits best with bacterial vaginosis. It typically features a reduction in the number of the normal hydrogen peroxide-producing Lactobacilli in the vagina. Simple measures such as reducing the use of body wash and considering using a lactic acid preparation to restore her natural vaginal flora will often reduce symptoms. A course of oral metronidazole for five - seven days will further reduce discharge and odour. In pregnancy, bacterial vaginosis may increase the risk of miscarriage."
infectious diseases,33,A homeless lady presents with cough and fever. She complains of night sweats and weight loss. CXR has been done and shows opacity. What is the next appropriate management?,AFB,Mantoux test,IFN gamma testing,Bronchoscopy,CT,A,"Cough, fever, night sweat and weight loss in a homeless lady are very suggestive of TB. So we should do AFB as her next investigation"
infectious diseases,34,"A 27-year-old man presents with pulmonary tuberculosis. He was released from a Chinese jail where he was a prisoner for some six years and has now applied for residency in the United Kingdom. On examination, you notice that he has a number of violaceous plaques on both lower limbs. Oral candidiasis is also present. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 4.2 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 195 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 120 μmol/L (60-120)    Which of the following is the most likely cause of his skin changes?",Coxsackie B,Herpes zoster,Human herpes virus 6,Human herpes virus 8,Human papilloma virus,D,"The skin condition that this patient is suffering from is suggestive of Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient with HIV infection (pulmonary tuberculosis and oral candidiasis). HHV-8 DNA was first sequenced from Kaposi's in the early '90s. Human herpes virus 8 is also associated with primary effusion lymphoma (a rare lymphoma of serous cavities) and Castleman's disease. AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma becomes smaller as immune function improves such as with treatment with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). In some circumstances, chemotherapy may be added to HAART. Radiotherapy may be used to treat painful or highly visible lesions."

infectious diseases,36,"Following your morning surgery you receive a telephone call from the lab at the local hospital regarding an 82-year-old patient of yours whom you admitted from her nursing home with headache, photophobia and neck stiffness. When you saw her, her temperature was 39.0°C, pulse rate 115 beats/min and there were no skin rashes or focal neurological signs. Her Glasgow coma scale was 15/15. Following admission, CSF was obtained and Gram stain showed Gram-negative coccobacilli, subsequent culture confirms a Haemophilus influenzae meningitis. What chemoprophylaxis should be offered to the nurses at her home?",Azithromycin,Ceftriaxone,Chloramphenicol,No chemoprophylaxis required,Rifampicin,E,"The decision to give chemoprophylaxis to contacts of patients with confirmed meningitis is usually made by Public Health England or the appropriate public health agency. However, it is important to be aware of the basic principles. With regard to Haemophilus influenzae, prophylaxis is recommended for three main groups:  Household contacts: any non-immunised contact, under 4 years of age, should receive the Hib vaccine. Rifampicin should also be given once daily (at 20 mg/kg), for four days (unless the patient is less than 4 and has been fully immunised). Nurses in this case would likely qualify as household contacts, but this should be discussed with the HPU. The index case should be immunised, irrespective of age. Room contacts of children in playgrounds, nurseries or creches. Any unimmunised children less than 4 years of age should be vaccinated. Chemoprophylaxis should be offered when two or more cases of Hib disease have occurred within 120 days.  Recommendations from the Department of Health and Public Health England state:  andquot;Rifampicin at a dose of 20 mg/kg (maximum 600 mg) once a day for four days for adults and children older than three months is the prophylaxis of choice for eliminating carriage in the index case and among household contacts (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) because it is highly effective (eradication rate of 92-97%) and Hib resistance to rifampicin is extremely rare (less than0.1%) in the UKandquot;.  Ciprofloxacin is an acceptable alternative. "
infectious diseases,37,Which of the following is least true regarding IgA nephropathy?,Commonly follows a sore throat,Is the most common glomerulonephritis in the world,Light chains may be found in the urine,May be associated with a rash and arthritis,Predominantly affects young men,C,"IgA nephropathy (Berger's disease) is the most common glomerulonephritis worldwide and characteristically affects young males, presenting with frank haematuria after an episode of pharyngitis. However, it may also present with proteinuria, microscopic haematuria, renal failure, or hypertension. It is most common during the second and third decade of life. It commonly occurs within two days of an onset of an upper respiratory tract infection, or less commonly, an infection of other mucous membranes (e.g. GI, bladder, breast). It should be diagnosed by a renal biopsy, where IgA is seen deposited in the mesangium. It is probably part of a spectrum of disease with Henoch-Schönlein purpura, which presents with arthritis, rash, abdominal pain, and nephritis and also has mesangial IgA deposits in the kidney. The treatment of IgA nephritis is variable. In a patient with haematuria only, the treatment is conservative. When there is nephrotic range proteinuria (greater than3 g/day - as in this case) an 8-12 week course of prednisolone should be prescribed. If the proteinuria is less than3 g/day an ACE inhibitor can be used. In all patients, careful control of blood pressure should be achieved, by using ACE inhibitors in the first instance, and regular follow-up of renal function and urinalysis. Whilst there can be light chains in the urine of patients with IgA nephropathy it is not seen in all patients, and it is not clearly linked to disease activity. Therefore, of the options listed above, this is the one which is the least correct."
infectious diseases,38,"A 24-year-old male presents with shortness of breath, chest pains and cough. He is a smoker of 10 pack/years and occasionally uses cocaine and ketamine. He uses PRN salbutamol inhaler for asthma diagnosed in childhood. He has been treated by his GP for chest infections four times in the past seven months, with different courses of antibiotics. On examination, he has a white exudate on his tongue and throat. His examination is otherwise normal. The nursing staff tells you that his saturations drop to 74% on room air when walking to the bathroom. What test will confirm your diagnosis?",Chest x ray,ECG,Peak expiratory flow,Sputum culture,Sputum immunofluorescence,E,"This gentleman has candidiasis of his throat that may be due to steroid inhaler usage (for his asthma) but given his other symptoms and history may well be secondary to HIV infection. He has recurrent chest infections and now symptoms compatible with PCP infection (dry cough, chest pains, desaturation on exertion, normal chest examination). The only test that will confirm this is sputum immunofluorescence. Severe cases should be treated with steroids in addition to co-trimoxazole or pentamidine. Chest x ray classically shows perihilar interstitial shadowing, but this can occur with other infections and therefore is not conclusive evidence. ECG will be unremarkable. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) may show reduction in his ability due to exacerbation of asthma in the presence of infection, but again it is not a diagnostic test. A straightforward sputum culture will not diagnose Pneumocystis jirovecii."
infectious diseases,39,"A patient with hepatitis B is found to have anti Hbc, HbsAg and anti Hbe. What does this indicate?",Chronic hepatitis B infection with high infectivity,Previous exposure to hep B but this has cleared,Acute infection,Previous immunisation,Chronic hepatitis B infection with low infectivity,E,This represents chronic infection and anti Hbe indicates that there is decreased infectivity.
infectious diseases,40,"A 17-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department complaining of difficulty breathing. He had been brought to hospital by ambulance, having collapsed shortly after being stung on the hand by a bee. On examination, his blood pressure was 80/40 mmHg, and facial swelling was noted. Which one of the following investigations is most likely to confirm the nature of the reaction?",Haemolytic complement (CH50) level,Plasma tryptase activity,Serum complement C3 level,Serum total IgE level,Serum venom-specific IgE level,B,"Type I hypersensitivity, also known as immediate or anaphylactic hypersensitivity, usually takes 15-30 minutes from the time of exposure to the antigen. The reaction may cause a range of symptoms from minor inconvenience to death. The reaction involves preferential production of IgE in response to certain antigens which in turn initiates a sequence of events leading to the release of various pharmacologically active substances that are responsible for the clinical features. Diagnostic tests include skin tests, measurement of total IgE and specific IgE antibodies against the suspected allergens. However, this question asks which of the following tests would provide confirmatory information and that would be tryptase. Tryptase is a neutral protease stored in mast cell secretory granules that is secreted by human mast cells. Levels in normal blood are undetectable (less than 1 ng/mL). Elevated serum levels demonstrate that mast cell activation with mediator release has occurred whether triggered by IgE-mediated anaphylaxis or non-IgE-mediated anaphylactoid reactions. The greater the severity of anaphylaxis, the more likely that serum tryptase levels will be elevated."
infectious diseases,41,A 35-year-old female who returned from holiday in Costa Rica two months ago now reports having ulceration around her neck with cervical lymphadenopathy. The lesion was initially a papule then it turned into a nodule and is now an ulcer. The ulcer is pruritic with raised undulated borders. The thin smears of dermal scraping show amastigotes when stained with Giemsa. What is the most likely aetiological agent?,Cutaneous leishmaniasis,Lepromatous leprosy,Mycobacterium tuberculosis ulceration,Visceral leishmaniasis,Visceral ulceration,A,"The history is typical of cutaneous leishmaniasis and the diagnosis is confirmed with the finding of amastigotes on a thin smear of dermal scrapings. Mycobacterium tuberculosis ulceration usually has undermined edges. They will not have any amastigotes in stain. Visceral ulceration is the wrong answer. Visceral leishmaniasis is the wrong answer as it presents differently. The patient's skin may turn grey with hepatosplenomegaly and some may have a lymphadenopathy. Lepromatous leprosy usually forms poorly marginated, multiple infiltrated nodules and plaques of diffuse infiltration."
infectious diseases,42,A 70-year-old woman developed herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Which one of the following is most likely to be a complication of this condition?,Hyphaema ,Keratitis ,Keratoconus ,Posterior subcapsular cataract ,Scleromalacia ,B,Keratitis due to varicella zoster virus (VZV) may subsequently lead to iridocyclitis and secondary glaucoma. All of the other conditions are not seen in VZV infection.  
infectious diseases,43,"A 50-year-old man comes to clinic and asks for advice about his risk of infection. Twenty years ago he had been involved in a road traffic accident and had sustained a splenic laceration, requiring an emergency splenectomy. Which of the following options offers the best advice?",He does not need prophylactic antibiotics due to the amount of time that has elapsed since his surgery,He has no increased risk of acquiring malaria when travelling to an endemic region,He has no increased risk of infection since he has been well for 20 years following surgery,He should receive pneumococcal vaccine,There is no increased risk of infection in patients who undergo splenectomy due to trauma,D,"Splenectomised patients are at increased risk of infection with encapsulated bacteria and infections that are filtered by the spleen (for example, malaria). Classically, the teaching has been that they are therefore required to take lifelong prophylactic antibiotics (often penicillin V). In current clinical practice, the need for such antibiotics is being questioned as there is a risk of bacterial resistance (especially if there is poor adherence) and side effects. Patients who are not felt to be at high risk of infection can be counselled regarding the risks and benefits of antibiotics and may choose to discontinue them. However, time is not usually a factor taken into account when assessing risk and therefore option 4 is a better choice than option 1.  When elective splenectomy is planned, vaccines to pneumococcus and meningiococcus should be given two weeks pre-surgery to allow an antibody response to evolve. Patients who have emergency splenectomies should be vaccinated post-operatively, though the response may not be as efficient."
infectious diseases,44,"A patient with HIV presents with fever, malaise, dyspnoea, diarrhoea, generalised lymphadenopathy and significant weight loss. His CD4 count is 20. There is evidence of tender hepatosplenomegaly. Given the most likely causative agent what antibiotic therapy should be commenced?",Ganciclovir,"Clarithromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin",Amphotericin B,Nitazoxanide,Pyrimethamine and sulfadizine,B,"The most likely causative agent is mycobacterium avium complex. It consists of mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium intracellulare. They are opportunistic pathogens and do not normally cause any significant problems however in immunocompromised it can become disseminated and lead to an illness as described here. Toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus tend to present  with neurological symptoms . Cryptosporidium is characterised by severe watery diarrhoea. Anaemia, pancytopenia and deranged LFTs can occur. Triple therapy with clarithromycin/erythromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin is useful for the management. Levofloxacin can be utilised in resistant cases."

What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Dental caries,Mumps,OE,OM,Temporomandibular joint pain,B,"Mumps is a viral disease caused by the mumps virus. Initial symptoms are non-specific and include fever, headache, malaise, muscle pain, and loss of appetite. These symptoms are usually followed by painful swelling of the parotid glands, called parotitis, which is the most common symptom of infection"
infectious diseases,47,A 41-year-old male has been diagnosed with infective endocarditis. Which of the following is associated with the best prognosis?,Aortic valve infection,Intravenous drug abuse,Prosthetic valve infection,Staphylococcus aureus infection,Streptococcus viridans infection,E,"Features suggestive of a worse prognosis are:  acute endocarditis (Staphylococcus aureus) heart failure IV drug abuse (often left and right-sided disease) prosthetic valve infection infection of the aortic rather than mitral valve, and associated rhythm disturbance.  Subacute bacterial endocarditis (Streptococcus viridans) has a better prognosis."
infectious diseases,48,An 18-year-old male presented with a two-week history of dysuria and purulent penile discharge. Gram stain of a urethral swab showed Gram negative intracellular diplococci. What specific treatment should he receive?,Cefixime,Cephradine,Ciprofloxacin,Co-amoxiclav,Crystalline penicillin,A,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae occurs in young adults and is often preceded by a migratory tendonitis or arthritis. Gram stain is positive in 25% and culture positive in 50%. Current UK guidelines recommend ceftriaxone 500 mg IM and azithromycin 1 g PO stat, where the diagnosis is confirmed and the infection is uncomplicated and localised to the anogenital region. A test of cure (with culture greater than72 hours or nucleic acid amplification testing greater than2 weeks) is recommended in all cases, and treatment failure should be reported to Public Health England or your local Health Protection Agency. Both in the UK and worldwide there is widespread resistance to penicillins, tetracyclines and ciprofloxacin and these agents are therefore not generally recommended. Alternatives to the regime described above are:  Cefixime 400 mg PO stat (if IM treatment contra-indicated or refused) Cefotaxime 500 mg IM stat or cefoxitin 2 g IM plus probenecid 1 g PO Spectinomycin 2 g IM stat (in beta-lactam allergic patients, currently off-licence) Cefpodoxime 200 mg PO stat Azithromycin 2 g stat  Fluoroquinolones are no longer used as first-line treatment due to the high rate of resistance. They can be considered in patients who have previously responded to treatment with a quinolone, but not in a case such as this. Bearing all this in mind, the most appropriate option of those listed above is cefixime. "
infectious diseases,49,Which of the following is true of tetanus?,Cephalic tetanus causes severe dysphagia,Clostridium-specific intravenous immunoglobulin is of no benefit once spasm has started,Failure to culture Clostridium tetani from the wound would make the diagnosis doubtful,Infection confers lifelong immunity,There is a characteristic EEG,A,"Cephalic means involving the cranial nerves usually from a wound on the head and neck. It may be confused with rabies but hydrophobia never occurs. While Clostridium-specific intravenous immunoglobulin is ineffective once the toxin is attached to nervous tissue it may prevent progression. The absence of a wound does not exclude tetanus. Patients need to be actively immunised after recovery. The toxin tetanospasmin does not cross the blood-brain barrier, it diffuses through the blood to bind to receptors containing gangliosides on the neuronal membranes of presynaptic nerve terminals in muscles. The toxin does reach the brain by axonal transport."
infectious diseases,50,A patient presents with jaundice and abnormal LFTs. He has been diagnosed with a hydatid cyst. Which of the following is the most likely causative agent?,Diphyllobothrium latum,Taenia Solium,Hymenolepis Nana,Taenia Saginata,Echinococcus granulosus,E,"Hydatid cysts are caused by the parasites Echinococcus granulosus or multilocularis. Dogs are the main hosts. The eggs invade the small intestine then enter the circulation and form cysts in the liver, lung, brain and bone and this can lead to numerous clinical presentations."
infectious diseases,51,Which of the following is correct regarding human varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG)?,Is invariably protective against severe varicella,Is recommended for all patients with eczema exposed to chickenpox,Is used to treat severe chicken pox infection,Should be given to a 6 week old baby whose mother has developed chickenpox,Should be given to an 18 week pregnant non-immune female who has been exposed to a case of chickenpox,E,"Varicella has a secondary infection rate in household contacts of 90%. It is commonest in spring time, and the incubation period is 14-21 days. It shares the herpes virus family properties of latency and reactivation (zoster). Risks to the fetus and neonate relate to the time of infection:  Less than 20 weeks pregnancy: congenital varicella (limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, cataracts, growth retardation, skin scarring). High mortality. Second to third trimester: herpes zoster in an otherwise healthy infant. Minus seven days to plus seven days after delivery: severe and even fatal disease (30% mortality).  Varicella zoster immunoglobulin is prepared from pooled plasma of UK blood donors with a history of recent chickenpox or herpes zoster. Being an immunoglobulin, it is a protein concentrate and should be stored between 2°C and 8°C. Donors are screened for HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. VZIG prophylaxis is recommended for patients who fulfil all the following criteria:  A clinical condition that increases the risk of severe varicella, (for example, immunosuppression, neonates, pregnant women) No antibodies to varicella zoster Significant exposure to chickenpox or herpes.  VZIG prophylaxis is of no benefit if chickenpox has already developed. Severe or fatal varicella can occur despite VZIG prophylaxis. Active immunisation should, therefore, be used for susceptible immunosuppressed patients at long-term risk. Clinical chickenpox occurs in 50% of those who receive VZIG prophylaxis, and 10% more will be affected sub-clinically. "

infectious diseases,53,A 17-year-old man presented with a strongly positive Mantoux test. Which one of the following statements regarding his immune reaction is correct?,"If a skin biopsy were taken, immunohistochemistry would show immune complex deposition",It is a cell mediated immune response,The area of induration will be less than 10 mm in diameter,The reaction typically develops within 24 hours,The response is mediated by B lymphocytes,B,"The Mantoux test replaced the Heaf test in 2005 in the UK. One of its uses is for patients who have had close contact with a person known to have tuberculosis. It measures the T cell-mediated immune response to TB antigen. Immune complexes are not involved (these result from antibody-mediated immune responses). The injection site should be reviewed 48-72 hours following intradermal inoculation of tuberculin. The left forearm is typically used. Only the induration, not surrounding erythema, is used in the measurement and the longest diameter is measured in millimetres:  Less than 6 mm: negative test, previously unvaccinated individuals can be given the BCG (within three months) provided there are no contraindications More than 6 mm but less than 15 mm: hypersensitive to tuberculin protein (may be due to previous TB infection, BCG, or atypical mycobacteria). Patients are not given the BCG if part of an immunisation programme. However, in other contexts (e.g. immigrant screening and contact tracing), further investigation should and follow-up may be indicated. More than 15 mm: strongly hypersensitive to tuberculin, suggestive of TB infection. Patients should be referred for further investigation and treatment  The reaction to tuberculin protein may be suppressed by viral infections, live viral vaccines, sarcoidosis, corticosteroids, immunosuppression, severe tuberculous disease and poor nutrition. "
infectious diseases,54,"A 51-year-old lady presented to hospital with a two-day history of malaise and headache. On the day of admission, the headache had become more intense and was associated with pain in her neck. Her husband reported that she had also been febrile and confused at times. She had previously been well and had no significant past medical history. On examination, she was febrile 38.1°C, looked unwell and was photophobic. Kernig's and Brudzinski's signs were positive. The fundi were normal with no evidence of papilloedema. Following a normal CT scan a lumbar puncture was performed and CSF analysis showed:    White cells 200/mm^3   Red cells 2/mm^3   CSF protein 0.9 g/L (0.15-0.45)   CSF glucose 1.6 mmol/L (3.3-4.4)   Plasma glucose 5.3 mmol/l (3.0-6.0)    What is the most likely causative organism?",Eschericia coli,Listeria monocytogenes,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Streptococcus pyogenes,D,"The most common causes of bacterial meningitis in persons over 50 years of age are:  Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis Listeria monocytogenes Gram negative bacilli.  Although this question tries to establish whether candidates are aware of the most common cause of meningitis in this group, some questions in the examination give additional clues as to the cause of meningitis. Physical examination may provide clues to the aetiology of meningitis in affected patients:  Morbilliform rash with pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy may suggest a viral aetiology (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV], cytomegalovirus [CMV], adenovirus, human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]). Macules and petechiae that rapidly evolve into purpura suggest meningococcaemia (with or without meningitis). Vesicular lesions in a dermatomal distribution suggest Varicella zoster virus. Genital vesicles suggest Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 meningitis. Sinusitis or otitis suggest direct extension into the meninges, usually with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Rhinorrhoea or otorrhoea suggest a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak from a basilar skull fracture, with meningitis most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy suggest a systemic disease, including viral (for example, mononucleosis-like syndrome in EBV, CMV, and HIV) and fungal (for example, disseminated histoplasmosis) disease. The presence of a murmur suggests infective endocarditis with secondary bacterial seeding of the meninges. Evidence of parotitis is observed in some cases of mumps meningitis.  Kernig's Sign: In a supine patient, flex the hip to 90° while the knee is flexed at 90°. An attempt to further extend the knee produces pain in the hamstrings and resistance to further extension. Brudzinski's Sign: Passively flex the neck while the patient is in a supine position with extremities extended. This manoeuvre produces flexion of the hips in patients with meningeal irritation. "
infectious diseases,55,"An elderly woman who had her right first metatarsal amputated two weeks previously for diabetic gangrene, presented with right foot pain, rash and fever. There were features of inflammation around the amputated area. Which one of the following investigations would you like to order to confirm the diagnosis?",Bone scan,CT scan,Indium-labelled leukocyte scanning,MRI scan,Right foot x ray,D,"Plain radiography of chronic osteomyelitis typically shows patchy osteopenia or frank bone destruction, loss of definition of the cortex, areas of sclerosis, or periosteal reaction with new bone formation. These changes take many weeks to develop fully. For more rapid clarification of diagnosis, however, specialised imaging is needed. Computed tomography (CT) scanning may be able to identify cortical erosion that has been missed on plain films and can demonstrate sequestra within bone. There is a lack of sensitivity early in the disease. White cell isotope scanning is widely used but there is a lack of consensus on the utility of various tests. Conventional three-phase technetium bone scans are sensitive but non-specific. Specificity may be increased by the addition of indium-labelled leukocyte scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the standard and best method for diagnostic imaging of osteomyelitis. It can detect intra- and extraosseous oedema, abscesses, dead bone, and sinus tracts. It can distinguish active from inactive infection."

As with all infections, antibiotic treatment should ultimately be guided by proven sensitivities and known sensitivities of local strains. In practice, you should, therefore, discuss such results with your local microbiologists. However, recent profiling of MRSA strains in England and Wales suggested all were sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim, vancomycin, linezolid and mupirocin. Antibiotic choice should be made depending on the severity of the infection and location of the infection. Current guidelines recommend community treatment for uncomplicated MRSA skin and soft tissue infections should be oral doxycycline (if greater than12 years) 100 mg BD or fusidic acid 500 mg TDS or trimethoprim 200 mg BD combined with rifampicin 300 mg BD. Oral linezolid 600 mg BD is an alternative use, but due to its high cost, it is generally reserved for secondary care and in patients who cannot tolerate other options. For more severe infections, either IV vancomycin or linezolid may be an appropriate option but you would take microbiology advice. Oral vancomycin is not absorbed systemically and therefore is generally only used for C. difficile infection. "

infectious diseases,59,"A 51-year-old homeless man is seen in the Emergency Department with a two-day history of a painful left little finger. He speaks little English and a history is difficult to establish. On examination, he has fusiform swelling of the finger with a small laceration on the pulp which looks old. The finger is held in flexion, there is pain on passive extension of the finger and tenderness on the volar aspect of the finger. Examination of the other fingers was unremarkable. What is the diagnosis?",Acute paronychia,Cellulitis,Flexor sheath infection,Interphalangeal joint septic arthritis,Palmar space infection,C,"Flexor sheath infection or infectious flexor tenosynovitis results from a microorganism (commonly Staphylococcus aureus) multiplying in the closed space of the flexor tendon sheath and culture-rich synovial fluid medium. This is usually secondary to penetrating trauma to the hand. The septic process and this inflammatory reaction within the tendon sheath quickly interfere with the gliding mechanism, leading to adhesions and scarring. The ultimate consequences are tendon necrosis, disruption of the tendon sheath, and digital contracture. Physical examination reveals Kanavel signs of flexor tendon sheath infection, which are:  finger held in slight flexion pusiform swelling tenderness along the flexor tendon sheath, and pain with passive extension of the digit.  Treatment is urgent surgical washout of the flexor sheath and intravenous antibiotics. Septic arthritis of the interphalangeal joints is extremely rare and usually presents with pain, swelling, and reduced range of motion of an individual joint. Acute paronychia often presents with a history of minor trauma to the fingertip. The presenting complaints are pain, tenderness, and swelling in one of the lateral folds of the nail and not along the finger. Palmar space infection is an infection of one or all the fascial compartments of the hand. It may result from untreated flexor sheath infection. It presents with pain and swelling of the entire hand with pain on massive movement of all digits. The patient in the scenario experienced pain on movement of the little finger only. Cellulitis of the hand presents with generalised swelling, erythema and pain. The skin looks shiny and is warm to touch. Generally, there is no exacerbation of pain with finger movement."

infectious diseases,61,Which of the following is true of anthrax?,Eschars are usually painless,Gastrointestinal anthrax is the most usual form of disease in humans,It causes trivial disease in the host herbivore population,"It is caused by an aerobic, Gram negative rod",Sputum culture has a high yield in inhalational anthrax,A,"Anthrax is caused by the Gram positive, aerobic, non-motile Bacillus anthracis. It produces serious disease in the herbivore host and carnivores acquire the disease from either consuming the spores from the dead animal or by contact. In humans, cutaneous disease is most common and a painless, black, indurated eschar frequently forms. Mortality from cutaneous disease is 20% if untreated whereas inhalational anthrax may have a mortality of 90% if untreated. Inhalational anthrax is associated with a poor yield from sputum culture with the greatest yield from blood culture."
infectious diseases,62,A 23-year-old male presented with a two-week history of dysuria and purulent penile discharge. Gram stain of a urethral swab showed Gram negative intracellular diplococci. Which one of the following is the most likely causative organism?,Chlamydia trachomatis,Cytomegalovirus,Mycoplasma hominis,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Ureaplasma urealyticum,D,"Neisseria gonorrhoeae occurs in young adults and is often preceded by a migratory tendonitis or arthritis. Gram stain is positive in 25% and culture positive in 50%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a species of Gram-negative bacteria responsible for the disease gonorrhoea. They are highly fastidious Gram-negative cocci, that is, they require special nutrients to survive. These cocci typically appear in pairs (diplococci). Chlamydia trachomatis is an intracellular organism but is difficult to stain with Gram stain which makes gonorrhoea more likely here.  The other three organisms described here do not classically present with these symptoms."
infectious diseases,63,A 30-year-old patient came to the OPD (out patient department) with complaints of breathlessness and dry cough. He has lost 5 kgs in 2 months. He is an IV drug abuser. Investigation: CXR bilateral interstitial shadowing.

infectious diseases,64,"A patient with HIV presents with fever, malaise, dyspneoa, diarrhoea, generalised lynphadenopathy and significant weight loss. His CD4 count is 20. There is evidence of tender hepatosplenomegaly. What is the most likely causative agent?",Cryptococcus,Mycobacterium avium complex,Toxoplasmosis,Cryptosporiosis,Histoplasmosis,B,"The most likely causative agent is mycobacterium avium complex. It consists of mycobacterium avium and mycobacterium intracellulare. They are oppurtunistic pathogens and do not normally cause any significant problems however in immunocompromised it can become disseminated and lead to an illness as described here. Toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus tend to present  with neurological symptoms . Cryptosporidium is characterised by severe watery diarrhoea. Anaemia, pancytopenia and deranged LFTs can occur. Triple therapy with clarithromycin/erythromycin, ethambutol and rifabutin is uaeful for the management. Levofloxacin can be utilised in resistant cases."
infectious diseases,65,"A 35 year old gentleman with HIV presents with one week's history of profuse watery, non bloody diarrhoea, approximately ten to twenty episodes per day. This is associated with abdominal cramps and a mild pyrexia. Modified acid fast staining of stools reveal red stained oocysts. Which of the following is the most likely causative agent?",Entaemoeba Histolytica,Cytomegalovirus,Shigella Dysenteriae,Giardia Intestinalis,Cryptosporidium Parvum,E,"The most likely causative agent is cryptosporidium parvum. This is a protozoan infection. It mainly affects children and the immunosuppressed and can lead to prolonged watery diarrhoea in AIDS. Bloody diarrhoea is not a feature. The cysts found on modified acid fast staining is characteristic. Entaemoeba Histolytica causesa ameobiasis and typically causes a bloody diarrhoea and stools samples are often negative. Giardia intestinalis typically leads to diarrhoea associated with cramps, bloating and flatulence. Trophozoites or cysts are identified through stool ova and parasite examination. Shigella dysenteriae typically leads to bloody diarrhoea. IN CMV colitis patients are typically more unwell and the stool findings are not typical."
infectious diseases,66,A 42-year-old man with advanced HIV disease presented with a tonic-clonic seizure. He had been diagnosed with HIV 10 years previously but had elected not to take antiretroviral therapy. A CT scan of his brain showed a 2 cm ring-enhancing lesion in the right parietal lobe. What is the probable causative agent?,Cryptococcus neoformans,Mycobacterium avium intracellulare,Mycobacterium tuberculosis,Pneumocystis jirovecii,Toxoplasma gondii,E,This is a typical presentation with AIDS-related cerebral toxoplasmosis. The differential diagnosis of ring-enhancing lesions on CT in a patient with AIDS include:  cerebral toxoplasmosis abscesses metastases atypical CNS lymphoma.  Cryptococcus typically cause meningitis. CNS infections with the remaining organisms are rare in AIDS. 
infectious diseases,67,In all non falciparum malaria what is the most appropriate initial treatment of choice?,Chloroquine,Doxycycline,Mefloquine,Quinine,Malarone,A,"For all non falciparum malaria the most appropriate initial treatment is with chloroquine as it is highly effective against the p. malariae, p. ovale and p. vivax (although in p.vivax) this is less so.  In resistant vivax quinine may be trialled."
infectious diseases,68,"Three elderly patients presented with cough, fever and general malaise on return from holiday to Spain. The group of 50 had travelled together, engaging in visits to hillside forestry, and fishing in mountain streams. They had been housed in different hotels. The three people who presented with illness all stayed in the same hotel. Which of the following organisms is most likely to be responsible for their illness?",Borrelia burgdorferi,Legionella pneumophila,Leptospira icterohaemorrhagiae,Mycoplasma pneumoniae,Pneumococcus,B,This is a typical story for Legionnaires' disease caused by Legionella pneumophila. The condition was described first in a veterans' legion conference in a similar fashion to the above description. Contaminated air conditioning units are often to blame. Weil's disease is unlikely given the story as is Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi). 
infectious diseases,69,"A 28-year-old man who had been diagnosed two weeks previously with tuberculosis of the mediastinal lymph nodes and who had been started on chemotherapy with rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide was admitted because of the increasing dyspnoea and stridor. Chest x ray showed compression of both main bronchi by carinal lymph node enlargement. What is the next step in management?",Mediastinoscopy and biopsy,Refer for tracheal stent insertion/tracheostomy,Refer for urgent CT scan of the mediastinum ,Start corticosteroids,The addition of ethambutol ,D,"The treatment of TB mediastinal lymphadenitis is the same as pulmonary TB. The phenomenon of a 'paradoxical reaction' during treatment for TB has been recognised for many years. This can result in new lesions, or worsening of existing lesions. It is unpredictable in its timing and can occur anything from a few days to many months after the start of treatment. Duration and severity are highly variable, and it can be difficult to differentiate from treatment failure, drug resistance or a superadded infection. Most cases are recognised in the setting of lymph node or cerebral disease. Enlargement is seen in 30% of cases. Occurrences are usually self-limiting. Corticosteroids are effective in reducing lymph node enlargement and inflammation and hence will help the stridor and breathlessness. As the compression is at the carina, tracheal stent or tracheostomy will not relieve the obstruction. The diagnosis is already known, therefore mediastinoscopy and biopsy will not give any extra information. The same applies to a CT. Whilst standard TB treatment is usually with ethambutamol, rifampicin, isoniazid and pyrazinamide initially for two months, when the organism is known to be fully sensitive ethambutamol need not necessarily be used. It is unlikely the omission of this drug has caused treatment failure and therefore adding it at this time is unlikely to relieve the symptoms. "
infectious diseases,70,"A 16-year-old boy presented with fever, headache, and neck stiffness for 24 hours. He had an identical illness requiring admission to hospital one year previously. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis shows white cells of 400/ml with a 90% neutrophilia and Gram stain revealed scanty Gram-negative diplococci. Which component of the immune system is likely to be defective?",B lymphocytes,Complement pathway,Immunoglobulin,Neutrophils,T lymphocytes,B,"This young man has a recurrent meningococcal meningitis, and deficiencies of complement C5-9 predispose to disseminated Neisseria infections (complement deficiencies). Deficiency of C3 also predisposes to infection by encapsulated organisms, such as Neisseria or Pneumococcus. One must recognise that the diplococci seen on microscopy are those of Neisseria meningitidis."
infectious diseases,71,Which of the following statement is true of infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis?,A positive tuberculin test indicates active disease,In pregnant women treatment should not be given until after delivery,Lymph node positive disease requires longer treatment than pulmonary disease,Non-sputum producing patients are non-infectious,Pyrazinamide has high activity against active extracellular organisms,D,Only untreated smear-positive pulmonary TB is likely to be infectious. Active disease may be indicated by grade III/IV response to tuberculin. Eighty percent of individuals with a history of BCG vaccination have grade I/II response. All forms of pulmonary TB may be treated equally except tuberculous pleural effusion which may require drainage (with large effusions causing breathlessness) and adjunct corticosteroids to delay reaccumulation. The length of treatment for other forms are:  bone TB - 9 months meningitis - 1 year drug resistance - 2 years.  Streptomycin has high activity against extracellular organisms whilst pyrazinamide have high activity against intracellular organisms.

infectious diseases,73,"You are asked to be part of a team reviewing the passengers on a cruise ship. Over the course of the past four days there has been a massive increase in cases of diarrhoea and vomiting and the ship has returned to port. Currently, over 300 passengers are estimated to be unwell. Apparently, a number of passengers ate at the speciality seafood restaurant or are sharing cabins with passengers who did. Out of 10 passengers admitted to the local hospital so far, all of them showed signs of dehydration, but no signs of raised white cell count. Which of the following is the most likely infective agent?",Campylobacter,Norovirus,Rotavirus,Salmonella,Shigella,B,"Three factors stand out:  The rapid spread of diarrhoea and vomiting The fact that most of the passengers had eaten in the ship's seafood restaurant Patients admitted to the hospital so far show no signs of neutrophilia, but do show signs of dehydration.  Norovirus is concentrated in shellfish, small oysters and plankton, and person to person spread can occur from aerosols of projectile vomit or faecal material. Rotavirus, in contrast, occurs more frequently in and is more severe in the paediatric population."

On examination there is tonsillar enlargement which are exudative and petechiae on his palate. There is evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly. Bloods reveal an elevated ESR and deranged LFTs. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Viral Pharyngitis,Viral Hepatitis,Group A Streptococcal Pharyngitis,HIV Seroconversion,Infectious Mononucleosis,E,"The history and clinical findings are highly indicative of epstein barr virus. There is often cervical lymphadeonpathy and hepatomegaly and a mild derangement of LFTs can occur. In EBV infection there is abnormal lymphocytes and heterophile antibodies are produced. The monospot test or paul bunnell test are utilised to identify these antibodies and make the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive and alcohol should be avoided. Amoxicillin should be avoided as it can lead to a maculopapular rash which is itchy. Complications include myocarditis, spelnic rupture (avoid exercise), haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis and neurological such as aseptic meningitis."

He had chosen not to take antiretroviral therapy but was taking co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. On examination, he had mild weakness of his left arm and leg in all muscle groups and a right homonymous hemianopia. Fundoscopy was normal with no evidence of papilloedema. A CT scan of his brain showed several areas of low attenuation in both cerebral hemispheres, but there was no enhancement with contrast and no mass effect. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral lymphoma,Cerebral toxoplasmosis,HIV encephalopathy,Neurosyphilis,Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy,E,"The most likely diagnosis is progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease seen in advanced HIV/AIDS and caused by the JC virus. Cerebral lymphoma and cerebral toxoplasmosis are often associated with mass effect on CT brain scanning. In CNS lymphoma there is usually a solitary lesion. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is frequently that show ring enhancement with IV contrast. HIV encephalopathy may be associated with confusion but is not associated with this CT appearance.

infectious diseases,77,A 55 year old male has been admitted to ITU with severe sepsis. He had required ventilation and multiple antibiotics due to resistance. He has recovered and has been transferred to the ward after 2 weeks in ITU. Unfortunately he becomes unwell and feverish. He has a cough productive of green sputum. A CXR confirms pneumonia. You are concerned about possible MRSA pneumonia. Which of the following is an appropriate antibiotic regime?,Co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin,Amoxicillin and Metronidazole,Vancomycin,Meropenem and gentamicin and vancomycin,Ceftriaxone,D,"This patient has  hospital acquired pneumonia and is at risk of multidrug resistance. HAP is most commonly caused in the first four days by  S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and after this is by Gram-negative enterobacteria, S. aureus or L. pneumophila. This antimicrobial regime provides broad spectrum cover including anti pseudomonal and MRSA cover and therefore this is the most appropriate regime."
infectious diseases,78,"In which of the following circumstances is MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisation contraindicated?",Family history of an adverse reaction following MMR immunisation,HIV positive individual who is not immunosuppressed,Patient is pregnant,Personal history of febrile convulsions,Unknown or inadequately documented immunisation history,C,"There are only a small minority of individuals who cannot have the MMR vaccination. The vaccine should not be administered to persons who are immunosuppressed (there are detailed guidelines that relate to specific conditions and the degree of immunosuppression which should be consulted on a case by case basis);  Those who have had a confirmed previous anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of a measles, mumps or rubella-containing vaccination Those who have a previous confirmed anaphylactic reaction to neomycin or gelatin, and Pregnant women.  True anaphylaxis following the administration of the MMR vaccination is very rare and occurs at a rate of 3.5 to 14.4 per million doses. If a minor allergic condition occurs this is not a contraindication to future vaccination. If there is any doubt then it is prudent to liaise with a specialist or local immunisation coordinator for further advice. In terms of pregnancy being a contraindication, there is no evidence that MMR vaccines are teratogenic. There is theoretical concern that because vaccines such as MMR are 'live' that there is risk of fetal infection. Even though the available evidence does not link live vaccines with birth defects the Department of Health guidance states that because there is a theoretical risk of fetal infection that live vaccines should be delayed until after delivery. Therefore pregnancy is listed as a contraindication. Inactivated vaccines cannot replicate and cannot cause infection in either the mother or the baby; however, they should only be used in pregnant women if protection is needed without delay. "
infectious diseases,79,"A 72 year old male has recently been treated with coamoxiclav for a UTI. He has now developed green diarrhoea. Stool is sent and is positive for Clostridium difficle toxin. His WCC is 17, he is apyrexial, renal function is static and there is no concerns of toxic megacolon. Which of the following would you commence?",Oral Vancomycin 500mg QDS,IV vancomycin and IV Metronidazole,Oral Metronidazole 400mg TDS,Oral Vancomycin 125mg QDS,IV Metronidazole 500mg TDS and oral Vancomycin 500mgQDS,D,"This patient has C diff - most likely secondary to the recent use of coamoxiclav. Patients with C diff should have daily severity scoring and a stool chart. The WCC count is raised and therefore he scores at least 1 on the severity scoring - other markers of severity include pyrexia, worsening renal function and concerns of dilatation or toxic megacolon. For those with no markers of severity, metronidazole is the treatment of choice. For those with 1 or more then oral vancomycin 125mg QDS should be utilised. If there is any concern of abdominal disctension or dilation on imaging, patients should be discussed with the surgical team immediately and patient should be commenced on oral vancomycin 500mg QDS, IV metronidazole 500mg TDS and discussed with an infection specialist. IV vancomycin plays no role in the management of c diff."
infectious diseases,80,"A 22-year-old student presents to the clinic complaining of a large crop of intensely painful blisters/ulcers and tingling pain affecting her vulva.

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Behçet's syndrome,Chancroid,Genital herpes simplex,Genital herpes zoster,Syphilis,C,"The answer is genital herpes simplex. The history of a mild constitutional illness coupled with painful and blistering genital ulceration and neuropathic type pain fits best with herpes simplex infection. Viral swabs for PCR are used for confirming the diagnosis, and the patient should be started on an appropriate oral anti-viral such as aciclovir. It is also mandatory that they undergo a full sexual health screen at the local genitourinary medicine clinic to exclude co-infection with another sexually transmitted disease. Topical anti-virals have no value in the management of the condition. The ulcers of syphilis, a differential here, are usually painless."
infectious diseases,81,A 70-year-old man presented to his GP with a two-day history of increasing confusion. He also complained of a headache. He was febrile on examination; nuchal rigidity was noted. A lumbar puncture was performed and CSF microscopy revealed WBC 800 cells/mL (less than 5) 90% neutrophils. A few Gram positive diplococci were also noted. What is the cause of his meningitis?,Cryptococcus neoformans,Haemophilus influenzae,Listeria monocytogenes,Neisseria meningitidis,Streptococcus pneumoniae,E,"A question on Gram staining properties of organisms causing meningitis. Pneumococcal meningitis is commoner in older patients. Neisseria meningitidis is a Gram negative diplococcus whilst Haemophilus influenzae is a Gram negative bacillus. Listeria monocytogenes is a cause of neonatal meningitis, and is a small Gram positive bacillus that is carried in the intestine and vagina and may be transmitted to the neonate during the birth process. Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus and yeast cells may be seen on microscopic examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)."
infectious diseases,82,"A 56-year-old man from Thailand presented with abdominal pain and a mass in the right upper quadrant. He reported that he had been diagnosed with viral hepatitis several years previously and had several treatment which he states reduced his disease burden significantly but he is still a chronic carrier. He reports no high risk sexual behaviour or Intravenous drug use.  Investigations showed:    Serum alpha-fetoprotein 13,500 IU/L (less than 10)    Which of the following is the most likely underlying viral infection?",Hepatitis A virus,Hepatitis B virus,Hepatitis C virus,Hepatitis D virus,Hepatitis E virus,B,"The patient has chronic viral hepatitis and presents with an AFP elevated to such a degree that it is essentially diagnostic for hepatoma. The underlying cause is either HBV or HCV. Since his country of origin is the only other detail given here this gives a clue to the cause of his hepatitis. There is a higher prevalence of HBV in the Far East, consequently, the most likely viral agent is HBV."
infectious diseases,83,"A 29-year-old man comes to the Emergency Department for review. He returned from a holiday in Spain two weeks earlier, and now complains of fevers, joint pains, pain passing urine and gritty eyes. There is no past medical history of note.

The clinical picture as described here is of reactive arthritis, which may have occurred as a result of chlamydial infection, although in about 10% of patients a preceding infection is not identified. Initial therapy of choice for the condition is NSAIDs. Other interventions such as corticosteroids are second line therapies. Antibiotics should be used where the causative infection is identified and is still active, and may shorten the duration of symptoms. Prednisolone may be considered if the response to NSAIDs is poor. There is limited experience with second line agents such as methotrexate and sulphasalazine, although small case series suggest a benefit. Where there is significant joint effusion, aspiration can be considered. This is especially important if only one joint is involved, as septic arthritis should be excluded as a cause."

If there is no pre-existing liver disease, LFTs are only repeated (and treatment stopped) if fever, malaise, vomiting, jaundice or unexplained deterioration occurs during treatment. Regular LFTs should be performed in patients with previously known chronic liver disease. If AST/ALT levels rise by five times normal/ bilirubin level rises, then rifampicin/isoniazid/pyrazinamide should be stopped. If the patient is not unwell and/or has non-infectious TB, no treatment until LFT returns to normal. If clinically unwell or sputum smear is positive within two weeks of starting treatment, consider streptomycin and ethambutol until LFT returns to normal. Once LFT is back to normal, challenge dosages can be reintroduced sequentially in order of isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide with daily monitoring of patient's condition and LFT. If there is a further reaction the offending drug should be excluded and a suitable alternative regimen used."

infectious diseases,93,"A 42 year old male who is being treated for lung cancer with chemotherapy has required a blood transfusion for symptomatic relief. He then then becomes unwell with fever, sore throat, fatigue and jaundice with lymphadenopathy. He is not neutropenic however is commenced on empirical antibiotic treatment for sepsis of unknown origin, however is not responding. What is the most likely causative organism?",Tuberculosis,Toxoplasmosis,MRSA,CMV,EBV,D,This patient presents with an EBV like illness however the most likely diagnosis is CMV. CMV can present like EBV however it is more common in the immunocompromised and if the patient has received blood which has not been CMV irradiated then this is a risk factor for its contraction.
infectious diseases,94,Which of the following is correct concerning oseltamivir?,It is a direct viral cytotoxic agent,It is a haemaglutinase inhibitor,It is administered via an inhaler,It is effective if administered within 7 days of symptoms of flu,It is of value in prophylaxis against influenza,E,"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu), like its predecessor zanamivir (Relenza) functions as an antiviral through inhibition of the enzyme neuraminidase, thus slowing viral replication down rather than directly killing the virus particle. This slowing down of replication is important in permitting time for the body's own immune system to deal with the virus. Unlike inhaled zanamivir, oseltamivir is administered orally. However, viral replication is rapid and to be effective the drug must be given as early as possible after the development of symptoms of flu and preferably within 48 hours. Examiner's comment: When we reviewed the answer stats for this question after 6000 responses, it's clear that many candidates are selecting the treatment option rather than prophylaxis, but the key here is the administration period. Oseltamavir is licenced in the treatment of influenza BUT only if administered within 48 hours, not 7 days and this is why this option is incorrect. BNF - Treatment of influenza"

She then developed an erythematous macular rash on her cheeks with circumoral pallor. What is the most likely causative agent?",Mumps,Streptococcus,Rubella,Parvovirus B19,Measles,D,This is the clinical presentation of slapped cheek which is caused by the parvovirus B19. In adults the most common presenting feature is a symmetrical arthritis.
infectious diseases,96,Which of the following is true of Giardia lamblia infection?,Causes steatorrhoea,Diagnosed by stool culture,Is eradicated by mebendazole,Is often symptomatic,Is usually spread by contaminated meats,A,"G. lamblia is usually acquired by the faeco-oral route. Many individuals excreting cysts are asymptomatic and are thus carriers. Others have diarrhoea, steatorrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea. It is diagnosed by stool microscopy; if negative, the parasite is found in duodenal aspirates or biopsy. Testing of serum antibodies against G. lamblia trophozoites is not useful in diagnosing current infection. It is eradicated with metronidazole (or quinacrine, tinidazole, ornidazole, furazolidone, paromomycin). Mebendazole is used in treating hookworm infections (for example, Ascaris, whipworm, and threadworm)."
infectious diseases,97,A 27 year old male attends an STD clinic. He is asymptomatic however is found to have syphilis. Which of the following should be used for treatment?,Procaine penicillin,Benzathine penicillin,Cefotaxime,Azithromycin,Doxycycline,B,Early latent syphilis as with primary and secondary syphilis should be treated with benzathine penicillin.

infectious diseases,99,"A 32-year-old woman complains of an offensive yellow vaginal discharge, with associated vulval itch and soreness. She admits to beginning a relationship with a new partner some four weeks earlier. On examination her vulva looks slightly erythematous and there is a yellow discharge that has a fishy odour. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Bacterial vaginosis,C. trachomatis,Herpes simplex infection,N. gonorrhoeae,T. vaginalis,E,"The answer is T. vaginalis. The clinical picture described fits entirely with infection with the anaerobic flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Trichomoniasis differs from non-infective vaginosis, with respect to a yellowish colour to the discharge and associated vulval irritation. A large dose of metronidazole (2 g as a single course), or a seven day course at lower dose is the treatment of choice. Patients should of course also be screened for other sexually transmitted infections. Partners should be identified and also screened for infection as men rarely exhibit symptoms of a T. vaginalis infection. The epithelial damage caused by T. vaginalis increases susceptibility to HIV virus infection and transmission. Whilst bacterial vaginosis is also associated with a discharge with a fishy odour, classically there is no soreness or irritation associated with it."

What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cutaneous Leishmaniasis,Sarcoidosis,Visceral Leishmaniasis,Guttate psoriasis,Lepromatous leprosy,A,"The most likely diagnosis is Leishmaniasis which is caused by parasites, transmitted by phlebotomine sand flies. It leads to the clinical features described. Visceral Leishmaniasis occurs in the immunocompromised and is associated with systemic features. Lepromatous leprosy leads to pale macules and other diffuse symptoms."
infectious diseases,103,"A 24-year-old IV drug abuser presents with jaw spasm to the Emergency Department. She says she re-used a heroin needle a few days ago and a couple of her sites look infected. She has suffered recurrent admissions with pneumonia over the past two years and has been using heroin for the past four years. On examination, she is pyrexial 37.8°C. She has jaw spasm, significant neck stiffness and looks in pain. Examination of her groin and left antecubital fossa reveals discharging sinuses from where she has injected heroin previously. Investigations show:    Hb 114 g/L (135-180)   WCC 10.8 ×10^9/L (4-10)   PLT 179 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 139 mmol/L (134-143)   K 4.5 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Cr 129 μmol/L (60-120)    She is given immunoglobulin.

Initial management of choice is anti-tetanus immunoglobulin, followed in this case by the addition of systemic antibiotics, either metronidazole or benzylpenicillin, and debridement of any wound if required. Diazepam, neuromuscular blockade, and intubation may all be required during the acute phase. Over the longer term, muscle spasms and ankle clonus can persist for many months."
infectious diseases,104,Twenty of 30 patients in an adult ward develop colicky abdominal pain and diarrhoea without vomiting between 21:00 and 01:00 hours. Meat stew was served for lunch at noon. Which of the following is the likely diagnosis?,Bacillus cereus,Clostridium perfringens,Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli,Enterovirus,Staphylococcus aureus,B,"This food poisoning with no vomiting and an incubation period between 9-13 hours is typical of Clostridium perfringens. The history is too long for a typical Staph. aureus infection (vomiting a typical feature, incubation period one to six hours) and rather short for enterovirus (24 hours). B.cereus can cause two patterns of disease. The classic emetic form is caused by the ingestion of toxin and is characterised by nausea and vomiting, similar to Staphylococcus aureus. Rice products are generally the cause of this form. The diarrhoeal form is caused by the ingestion of the organism, which releases toxin within the stomach. This can produce an illness similar to C. perfringens with watery diarrhoea and abdominal cramps. Meats, milk, vegetables, and fish have been associated with this form of the illness. This form is much less common, and the incubation period is classically shorter (1-6 hours) and therefore in this case C. perfringens is much more likely to be the diagnosis. Escherichia coli infection has an incubation period of 12-24 hours and is also associated with marked vomiting. Supportive treatment is all that is generally required with symptoms resolving after 24 hours."
infectious diseases,105,Which of the following is true concerning whooping cough (pertussis)?,"Is a greater threat to children during the second six months of life, after maternal antibody has declined, than during the first six months",Is associated with convulsions less frequently than is the case with other febrile conditions,Is characteristically associated with a polymorph leucocytosis,The vaccine may lead to hemiplegia,Rapidly resolves with antibiotic treatment,D,"Whooping cough (pertussis) is caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. B. pertussis is a very small gram-negative aerobic coccobacillus that appears singly or in pairs. Infection is characterised by paroxysms of coughing. Lymphocytosis is typically found. The pertussis vaccine is estimated to be 63% to 94% effective in the diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus (DPT) shot. A rare complication is a hemiseizure-hemiplegia syndrome, which is thought to be related to post-immunisation hyperthermia rather than direct neurological toxicity. The incidence of pertussis is highest in infants, but it is also seen in adolescents and adults. It is infants under the age of 3 months who are at the highest risk of severe complications, hospitalisation and death. Febrile convulsions are seen with equal prevalence to other childhood infectious diseases. Although it is a bacterial disease, antibiotics do not alter the clinical course once the disease is established. Erythromycin, clarithromycin and azithromycin may be given however as they have been shown to reduce the period the patient is infective for."
infectious diseases,106,The morphological appearance of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the lung is best characterised as which one of the following?,A bronchopneumonia with abscess formation,A haemorrhagic and necrotising pneumonia,An acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with widespread hyaline membrane formation,An interstitial pneumonitis with foamy intra-alveolar exudate,An organising bronchopneumonia,D,"Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) or pneumocystosis is a form of pneumonia, caused by the yeast-like fungal organism Pneumocystis jirovecii. The organism is confined to the alveolar space of the lung and produces debris and cysts in the alveolar space with interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. As a result, it can cause profound disturbance of oxygen exchange and fatal hypoxaemia if left untreated."

She is unable to speak properly. She is on anti-TB treatment. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Creutzfeldt Jacob disease,Drug toxicity,Vascular dementia,HIV associated dementia,Space occupying lesion,D,Blood transfision is the clue for HIV transmission. Immunodeiciency is also responsible for TB
infectious diseases,108,"A 27-year-old man presents with fever, urethritis and arthralgia. He is found to have a swollen ankle with a pustular rash on the dorsal aspect of his foot. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Disseminated gonorrhoea,Lyme disease,Reactive arthritis,Staphylococcal arthritis,Tuberculous arthritis,A,"The most likely cause for this acute presentation is disseminated gonorrhoea - with a pustular rash on the dorsum of his foot, fever, urethritis and oligoarthritis. Gonorrhoea is the second most common bacterial STI in the UK after chlamydia. It is caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, a Gram negative diplococcus. Transmission occurs by inoculation of infected secretions, with a typical incubation period of two to five days. Primary infection is symptomatic in 90-95% of men, but only 50% of women. It typically presents with urethral or vaginal discharge, dysuria and abdominal pain. Anal and pharyngeal disease is usually asymptomatic. Spread can occur to involve the epididymis, prostate, endometrium and pelvic organs although this is rare (less than10%). Even less common is haematological dissemination, which results in skin lesions, arthralgia, arthritis and meningitis. There is an increased risk of acquiring HIV infection if you are infected with gonococcus. Culture is the traditional first line diagnosis test, but rapid diagnosis can be undertaken using light microscopy of genital specimens to detect the bacteria. Increasingly, nucleic acid amplification tests are used but if positive it should be followed by culture to confirm diagnosis and check antibiotic sensitivities. Treatment is with antibiotics depending on local sensitivities. Lyme disease is caused by a tick-borne spirochaete, Borrelia burgdorferi. It is a multisystem inflammatory disease initially characterised by a spreading erythema migrans rash and can disseminate to the musculoskeletal, neurological or cardiovascular system. Stages of the disease have varying manifestations, but none would fit the description above. Reactive arthritis is an autoimmune condition that develops in response to an infection. Classically this is described as a triad of urethritis, conjunctivitis and arthritis. Precipitating infections include gastrointestinal organisms such as Salmonella and genitourinary infections, especially Chlamydia. Skin rash as described above is not typically present. Staphylococcus and tuberculosis are both causes of septic arthritis. Patients are often systemically unwell and urethritis would not be expected. "
infectious diseases,109,A 25-year-old male is admitted with dyspnoea and weight loss of two months duration. He is diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci as a consequence of HIV infection. Which of the following concerning Pneumocystis jiroveci is true?,Elevated serum antibodies to P. jiroveci are helpful diagnostically,It is always associated with x ray changes,It is best treated with intravenous pentamidine,It is caused by a bacterium,May have an extra pulmonary presentation,E,"Although rare, Pneumocystis jiroveci can present in a number of extrapulmonary locations. These include the central nervous system, bone marrow, lymph nodes, eyes, thyroid and gastrointestinal tract. This can result in pancytopenia, retinal cotton wool spots and thyroid masses. There is polyclonal B-cell activation in AIDS. 5-15% have a normal chest radiograph. It is best treated with intravenous cotrimoxazole not intravenous pentamidine. It is caused by a fungus, not a bacterium."
infectious diseases,110,"A 56 year old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with severe pain in his shin after cutting it in the garden. On examination there is an area of erythema and swelling which is hot and tender to touch. It is extremely painful and tender even out with the erythematous area. He feels unwell and is tachycardic. Given the most likely diagnosis, what initial antibiotic regime is appropriate?",IV benzylpenicillin + clindamycin + gentamicin,IV meropenem,IV benzylpenicillin,IV benzylpenicillin + IV flucloxacillin,IV flucloxacillin,A,This presentation with pain out of proportion to clinical findings is highly suspicious of necrotising fasciitis. It presents similarly to cellulitus however rapidly progresses and spreads with affected area becoming hard and there can be evidence of surgical emphysema. Nerves can be damaged and anaesthesia become apparent. It is commonly caused by Group A strep. Or polymicrobial infection. It is more common in the immunocompromised and diabetes is a risk factor. Broad spectrum IV antibiotics with IV benzylpenicillin/meropenem + clindamycin + gentamicin is an appropriate initial regime. Urgent surgical referral for surgical debridement is key. Amputation rates are still high.
infectious diseases,111,"A patient is commenced on vancomycin, rifampicin and gentamicin for an MRSA infective endocarditis. However the patient has an allergy to vancomycin. Which of the following is an appropriate alternative?",Fluconazole,Meropenem,Daptomycin,Ceftriaxone,Metronidazole,C,Daptomycin has been shown to be an appropriate alternative to vancomycin if there is evidence of resistance or allergy. Another option is linezolid.

Five weeks ago, three weeks after he returned from holiday, he developed fever, pharyngitis, myalgia and a skin rash. The patient also has a generalised lymphadenopathy. There two Paul-Bunnell tests which are negative one week apart. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute HIV syndrome,CMV mononucleosis,Infectious mononucleosis,Streptococcal pharyngitis,Toxoplasmosis,A,"The acute HIV syndrome very much resembles infectious mononucleosis. They have the same incubation period of three to six weeks. The signs and symptoms are the same. The Paul-Bunnell test is negative for acute HIV syndrome but positive for infectious mononucleosis. With streptococcal pharyngitis the patient is more likely to have a sore throat, fever, chills, malaise and abdominal complaints. It has a short incubation period of one to four days. Both the Paul-Bunnell test and DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for HIV will be negative. Infectious mononucleosis has similar signs and symptoms to acute HIV syndrome but with a positive Paul-Bunnell test. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) mononucleosis has a longer incubation period of 20-60 days. The illness takes two to six days. There are fever, chills, profound fatigue, malaise and myalgia. With toxoplasmosis, there are usually single or multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes which are discrete, non-tender and vary in firmness. The patient may also have:  Fever Headache Malaise Fatigue Myalgia Sore throat Maculopapular rash Meningoencephalitis, and Confusion.  Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amplification DNA for toxoplasmosis gives the confirmatory diagnosis."

Clinical examination reveals a BP of 125/72 mmHg, pulse is 70 and regular. Her chest is clear. A Mantoux test results in a reaction measured at 17 mm. Which of the following is the correct way to manage her?",Arrange for a bronchoscopy,Arrange for sputum samples to be collected,Reassure her she is immune to TB and requires no further action,Start anti-tuberculous chemotherapy,Vaccinate her with BCG,B,"The Mantoux test replaced the Heaf test in 2005 in the UK. One of its uses in for patients who have had close contact with a person known to have tuberculosis. The injection site should be reviewed 48-72 hours following intradermal inoculation of tuberculin. The left forearm is typically used. Only the induration, not surrounding erythema, is used in the measurement and the longest diameter is measured in millimetres:  Less than 6 mm - negative test, previously unvaccinated individuals can be given the BCG (within three months) provided there are no contraindications. More than 6 mm but less than 15 mm - hypersensitive to tuberculin protein (may be due to previous TB infection, BCG, or atypical mycobacteria). Patients are not given the BCG if part of an immunisation programme. However, in other contexts (e.g. immigrant screening and contact tracing), further investigation should and follow-up may be indicated. More than 15 mm - strongly hypersensitive to tuberculin, suggestive of TB infection. Patients should be referred for further investigation and treatment.  The reaction to tuberculin protein may be suppressed by viral infections, live viral vaccines, sarcoidosis, corticosteroids, immunosuppression, severe tuberculous disease and poor nutrition. Bronchoscopy would not usually be considered unless other investigations have proved inconclusive. Anti-tuberculous therapy is commenced only after infection is confirmed, and patients with a positive Mantoux do not require BCG vaccination. "

Which one of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this woman?,Cefotaxime,Clarithromycin,Co-amoxiclav,Minocycline,Vancomycin,B,The most appropriate treatment for legionellosis is clarithromycin. Ciprofloxacin is also a useful drug in combination with clarithromycin for severe infections or alone in those intolerant of macrolides. Minocycline is used in acne.  Cefotaxime is used as broad spectrum cover in cases of penicillin allergy.  Vancomycin is commonly used in C difficile infection or Gram positive infections.
infectious diseases,117,"A 36-year-old single woman with a history of asthma comes to the clinic complaining of symptoms of indigestion. She uses a steroid inhaler and on examination of her oropharynx, you can see obvious evidence of candidiasis. You send her for an endoscopy, which unfortunately reveals extensive oesophageal candidiasis. Which of the following tests would be most important to consider in this patient?",CD4 count,Complement testing,Fasting blood glucose,HIV antibody testing,Immunoglobulin testing,D,"The answer is HIV antibody testing. Whilst candidiasis affecting the oropharynx may be a result of poor inhaler technique and deposition of steroid powder within the mouth, it does not usually result in oesophageal candidiasis. The other possible cause of recurrent oral and genital candida infection is diabetes mellitus, although again this would not normally lead to oesophageal disease. In the case of this patient, immunocompromise should be suspected and HIV considered, with appropriate pre-test counselling."
infectious diseases,118,A patient of yours has returned from a holiday abroad with a diarrhoeal illness. They were one of twenty-four passengers on a Nile cruise who developed bloody diarrhoea on the third day. Which of the following organisms is the likely cause?,Entamoeba histolytica,Giardia lamblia,Schistosoma mansoni,Shigella dysenteriae,Vibrio cholerae,D,"Dysentery is characterised by the passing of frequent (sometimes very frequent) stools, that may contain blood, mucus or pus. Shigella dysenteriae is responsible for bacillary dysentery, a disease most often associated with crowded, unsanitary conditions. Other species of Shigella may produce milder forms of diarrhoeal disease. Dysentery is an oral infection transmitted via faecal contamination of water or food. During the one to four day incubation period, penetration of bacteria into the mucosal epithelial cells of the intestine causes an intense irritation of the intestinal wall, producing cramps and a watery, bloody diarrhoea. Amoebiasis is most commonly asymptomatic initially, with cysts being present in the faeces (although stool examination has low sensitivity). Symptoms can develop later in the disease course, with lower abdominal pain and diarrhoea. Dysentry can then develop if left untreated. According to the AKT content guide, you will also need to have an understanding of the following conditions: andquot;Gastrointestinal infection including toxins such as C. difficile and E coli, bacterial causes such as salmonella, campylobacter, amoebic dysentery, viral causes such as rotavirus, norovirus and parasitic causes such as Giardia lambliaandquot; "

Treatment for CNS tuberculosis consists of an initial four-drug period for two months, usually including rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol, followed by a two-drug therapy period for 9-12 months consisting of isoniazid and rifampicin alone. Where there is evidence of a tuberculoma up to 18 months of treatment is required. Adjunctive corticosteroids are given for CNS TB, as they are thought to reduce death or permanent disability by up to 30%. The other treatment durations are too short to achieve adequate eradication of tuberculosis. Two months is merely the period of intense initial anti-tuberculous therapy. Six months of therapy is usually given for patients with respiratory tuberculosis, without CNS involvement. "

What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Acute mastoiditis,Dental abscess,Herpes zoster infection,Oropharyngeal malignancy,Tonsillitis,D,"Pain ear and discomfort during swallowing, ulceration at the back of the tongue and palpable non tender cervical lymphnode is suggestive of oropharyngeal malignancy. Acute mastoiditis and tonsillitis will not cause tongue ulcer. Similarly dental abscess will not cause tongue ulcer. In herpes zoster pain and vesicle will be in the affected nerve distribution"
infectious diseases,121,A patient is planning to travel through the southern states of America but is worried about West Nile virus. Which of the following statements regarding West Nile virus is correct?,Infection is non-fatal,Is a member of the picornavirus family,May be associated with poliomyelitis-like paralysis,Transplacental transmission does not occur,Treatment with interferon is effective in West Nile virus encephalitis,C,"West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne zoonotic arbovirus belonging to the genus Flavivirus. It is thought it is spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a human. Few of those bitten develop symptoms and even fewer progress to severe disease. West Nile virus can be spread via vertical transmission as well as blood transfusions and organ transplant. If infected with the virus there are generally three different outcomes:  Asymptomatic (estimated 90%) A mild febrile syndrome known as West Nile fever, or rarely Neuro-invasive disease termed West Nile meningitis or encephalitis.  West Nile fever can present with several vague 'generally unwell' symptoms that tend to last three to six days such as:  abdominal pain diarrhoea fever headache arthralgia nausea and vomiting rash sore throat, and lymphadenopathy.  The following symptoms are suggestive of West Nile encephalitis/meningitis and prompt medical attention is required: Extrapyramidal signs include:  confusion and seizures loss of consciousness or coma muscle weakness stiff neck, and weakness of one arm or leg (a poliomyelitis-like paralysis).  Diagnosis can be via blood or cerebral spinal fluid serology for West Nile antibodies. More rapid techniques using polymerase chain reaction may be used. Due to the viral nature of the infection, the current best treatment is supportive. In general, it has an excellent prognosis. For those rare cases with severe infection, it may lead to brain damage and death. Approximately 10% of patients with brain inflammation do not survive. In 2003 there were 276 deaths attributed to West Nile virus. Interestingly, West Nile Virus is endemic in the avian population. The deaths of large numbers of birds in an area may thus herald an imminent epidemic of West Nile virus."
infectious diseases,122,"A back packer has just returned from India and presents to his GP with a sore throat.  He initially felt like he had a cold and then noticed a very severe sore throat and difficultly swallowing.  He feels pyrexial and unwell.  On examination there appears to be a pseudomembrane over his pharynx and he has enlarged cervical lymph nodes giving him a “bull neck” appearance.  Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment should be initiated?",Hydrocortisone,Blood cultures,Benzylpenicillin,Antitoxin,Tracheostomy,D,The most likely diphtheria given the pseudomembrane over the pharynx and the bull neck appearance.  This may be mistaken with infectious mononucleosis which leads to enlarged cervical nodes/  Tonsillitis can also lead to an exudate although it is usually not as severe as the one observed in diphtheria.  The clue if the patient has visited an area where diphtheria has not been completely eradicated.  Diphtheria toxin can lead to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis 10 to 14 days after onset.  Thrombocytopenia and nephritis and proteinuria can also occur.   It is essential that antitoxin be commenced within 48 hours of onset to prevent the complications.  IV benzylpenicillin should also be commenced.  Tracheostomy may be required if the exudate is severe and there is respiratory obstruction.
infectious diseases,123,"A 35-year-old man presented with cellulitis of his right leg. On examination, he was mildly confused and febrile (40.1°C) with a pulse of 120/minute and BP 80/55 mmHg. He was treated with intravenous benzylpenicillin and flucloxacillin. Group A Streptococcus was isolated from two sets of blood cultures. There was no significant clinical improvement after 24 hours. What antibiotic should be added?",Ciprofloxacin ,Clindamycin,Gentamicin,Rifampicin,Vancomycin ,B,"The patient has a severe cellulitis with features of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Streptococcal TSS is mediated via streptococcal exotoxins. Although Clindamycin is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, it acts by switching off protein synthesis within bacteria; this, in turn, will lead to decreased exotoxin expression, thereby removing the mediators of TSS. Ciprofloxacin offers gram negative cover and is used in skin or repiratory infections.  Gentamicin offers gram positive and negative cover and is often used in combination with penciillin in severe infections.  Vancomycin offers gram positive cover.  Rifampacin is used in combination therapy in TB."

Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 119 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 9.7 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 204 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 136 mmol/l (135-146)   Serum potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 111 µmol/L (79-118)   Glucose 6.7 mmol/L (non-fasting)   CSF Opening Pressure 220 mm H2O (50-180)   CSF Glucose 6.5 mmol/L (3.3-4.4)   India Ink Test positive   CT scan small ventricles but otherwise unremarkable    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cryptococcal meningitis,HIV dementia,HIV encephalopathy,Meningococcal meningitis,Tuberculous meningitis,A,"The answer is cryptococcal meningitis on a background of HIV infection. The insidious onset seen here, coupled with signs of raised intracranial pressure, normal glucose on CSF sampling and positive India ink test are all strong pointers to the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. India ink smears, however, are less sensitive and specific than CSF cryptococcal antigen test, which has a sensitivity of greater than 95%, but false negative tests can occur with a low organism burden. MRI scanning is more sensitive than CT and may show low-intensity lesions in the basal ganglia which enhance with gadolinium. Treatment, in this case, would be with amphotericin B combined with flucytosine, although good results have also been seen with flucytosine and fluconazole combination therapy. Despite aggressive intervention, however, mortality is still high at around 6%."
infectious diseases,125,"A 22 year old student has just returned from south America. He presents with pyrexia, jaundice, abdominal pain and vomiting. He has noticed bleeding from his nose and gums. This was preceded by a flu like illness with headache, fever and myalgia especially back pain. He thought he was recovering and then the other symptoms began. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Yellow Fever,Typhoid Fever,Dengue Fever,Ebola Virus,Malaria,A,"The most likely diagnosis is yellow fever. Yellow fever virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted by mosquitoes. It is endemic in Africa and South America. It normally presents with a flu like illness with myalgia, particularly severe back pain and fever. This acute phase lasts for about 3 to 4 days then resolves and then within 24 hour the acute phase of deep jaundice, fever, DIC and ARF can occur. Relative bradycardia is often seen. In dengue fever there may be DIC however a rash is often seen and jaundice is less common. In typhoid diarrhoea is predominant. In ebola virus there may be evidence of hepatitis and jaundice and DIC however often there is a rash or conjunctivitis and normally there is respiratory and cardiovascular symptoms also."
infectious diseases,126,A patient presents with purple papular lesions on his face and upper trunk measuring 1-2 cm across. They aren’t painful or itchy. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Kaposi’s sarcoma,Hairy leukoplakia,Cryptosporidium,CMV infection,Cryptococcal infection,A,"It is a spindle-cell tumour derived from capillary endothelial cells or from fibrous tissue, caused by human herpes virus.

On examination he is hypotensive but his heart rate is only 90.  His abdomen is distended and there is evidence of hepatomegaly and splenomegaly.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Typhoid fever,Tuberculosis,E Coli,Influenza,Malaria,A,"This patient most likely has typhoid fever which presents initially with either constipation or diarrhoea and fever with the addition of sometimes a cough and headache.  During the second weak the patient becomes more unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting and a high temperature.  Despite being well however a feature which gives a clue to this as the diagnosis is the relative bradycardia despite being pyrexial and unwell.  In the third week the patient there is weight loss  and marked abdominal distension with pea soup diarrhoea.  Hepatomegaly and splenomegaly are sometimes observed and rose spots often seen in the second week.  Typhoid can be complicated by haemorrhage, bowel perforation, hepatitis, pancreatitis and toxic myocarditis and confusional states.  It is caused by the gram negative salmonella typhi or salmonella paratyphi.  For the diagnosis these can be cultured or there is the Widal test which is a serological test.  Fluoroquinolone can be utilised however in resistant cases azithromycin and ceftriaxone are alternatives."

On examination you notice a circular lesion on his leg. There is an annular raised erythematous area. Which of the following is the most likely causative agent?,Babesia,Meningococcus,Borrelia burgdorferi,Parvovirus B19,Rickettsia rickettsii,C,"The rash described is characteristic of erythema chronicum migrans which is caused by Borrelia burgdorferi, a spirochaete leading to Lyme disease and is transmitted by the ixodid tick.  It can lead to arthralgia and can lead to cardiac abnormalities such as heart block and can lead to neurological features such as cranial nerve palsies. This is not the typical rash of meningococcus."
infectious diseases,130,A 23-year-old female presents 16 weeks into her pregnancy with a vaginal discharge. Further investigation confirms infection with Chlamydia trachomatis. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?,Ciprofloxacin,Cotrimoxazole,Doxycycline,Erythromycin,Metronidazole,D,"C. trachomatis infection is increasingly common in the UK and is associated with adverse fetal outcome including spontaneous miscarriage, premature rupture of membranes and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). In the UK treatment is advised ahead of test results if chlamydia is strongly suspected clinically. Current UK guidelines recommend three different options in pregnancy:  Erythromycin 500 mg QDS for 7 days or BD for 14 days Amoxicillin 500 mg TDS for 7 days Azithromycin 1 g stat - the BNF cautions that this should only be used if there are no alternatives. However, guidelines seem to vary in their recommendation of azithromycin with many advocating its use as a stat dose  In the actual examination you would not be expected to decide between erythromycin and azithromycin based on varying opinions, so we have avoided including azithromycin and amoxicillin in the list of question options for this reason. Therefore, of the options given above, erythromycin is the most appropriate option. Doxycycline can be used in non-pregnant patients (100 mg BD for 7 days), but is not appropriate here. Co-trimoxazole and metronidazole are not routinely used in the treatment of chlamydia. Also important to note is the recommendation that pregnant patients be tested for cure, 5 weeks after completing treatment (or 6 weeks if azithromycin is used). "

It is typically associated with inadequate heating of rice. S aureus can cause a similar illness but is typically associated with preprepared food. E coli 0157 is typically associated with diarrhoea which can be bloody and can lead to Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome. Campylobacter ialso leads to a diarrhoeal illness and has a longer incubation.
infectious diseases,134,A 17-year-old male presented with a widespread maculopapular rash. He had been prescribed amoxicillin for exudative tonsillitis. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute HIV infection,Cytomegalovirus infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Parvovirus infection,Streptococcal infection,C,This patient has the typical features of glandular fever and this is confirmed by the typical rash following the introduction of amoxicillin. This rash is considered almost pathognomonic of glandular fever and will subside following the withdrawal of amoxicillin. There are no other features in this patient's history to suggest an alternative diagnosis. The other options may present with the same rash but not usually following penicllin ingestion.
infectious diseases,135,"A 12 year old is brought to his GP. He has been unwell for the last few days with a fever, coryza, diarrhoea and a dry cough. On examination there is evidence of small red spots with a white speck in the centre opposite the second molar on the buccal mucosa.

The definitive host is the cat. Oocysts excreted with cat faeces can remain in soil for months. First trimester toxoplasmosis can cause IUGR, developmental delay (with intracerebral calcification), and hearing loss. Risk of fetopathy is reduced by more than 50% if spiramycin, which can prevent maternal-fetal transmission, is given to mothers (not prophylactic IgM)."
infectious diseases,138,"A 42-year-old single man comes to the clinic some two weeks after a tour to Thailand. During his trip, he admits to unprotected sex with a number of prostitutes. Since his return, he has been suffering fevers and night sweats over the past few days and has noticed some swollen lymph nodes in his neck, armpits and groin. He has also felt nauseated and been off his food. On examination, you confirm that he has a low-grade fever of 37.6°C and lymphadenopathy. He also has pharyngitis.

Which of the following would be an appropriate test to detect this?",Anti-HIV antibody by ELISA,Anti-HIV antibody by western blot,CD4 count,CD8 count,P24 antigen,E,The answer is P24 antigen. The concern here is that testing would be too soon to detect antibodies to HIV in the serum. As such P24 antigen testing may detect HIV infection one to three weeks after the event and is the most appropriate option here. The alternative is HIV RNA testing to estimate viral load. HIV antibody testing by western blot has a lower false positive rate than HIV antibody by ELISA and may be an option when a false positive result is suspected. CD4 counts begin to reduce later in HIV infection.

They are white-centred retinal haemorrhages, caused by capillary fragility. In addition to subacute bacterial endocarditis, they can also be seen in leukaemia and retinal ischaemia. Other peripheral features of endocarditis include Osler's nodes (tender subcutaneous nodules caused by immune complex deposition), and Janeway lesions (painless erythematous or haemorrhagic macular or papular lesions, on the palms and soles, caused by infective emboli in the skin). A cherry-red spot on the macular is characteristic of central retinal artery occlusion. It is seen due to the relative pallor of the surrounding retina. A macular star is caused by deposits of hard exudate (usually lipid) within the fibre layer of the retina, radiating out in a star-like pattern. It can occur in a number of conditions, including hypertensive retinopathy and neuroretinitis. Retinal artery aneurysms develop with age and can be associated with hypertension. They are usually benign but can result in macular haemorrhage, exudate or oedema, or vitreous haemorrhage."

infectious diseases,145,"A 27-year-old man comes to the Emergency Department with a 14 hour history of severe abdominal pain with bloody diarrhoea. He has opened his bowels 12 times overnight. Apparently he shared an Indian takeaway with friends two days earlier, and one of the friends is also ill with similar symptoms. On examination he is pyrexial at 38.1°C, his BP is 100/70mmHg, with a postural drop of 15mmHg, and his pulse is 90bpm and regular. His abdomen is generally tender, with worse pain affecting the right iliac fossa. He provides a stool sample which contains liquid faeces mixed with blood and mucus. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Amoebic dysentery,Campylobacter,E coli 157,Norovirus,Salmonella,B,"The answer is campylobacter. The clues here include the history of a recent takeaway meal, the fact one other member of the party is ill, and the gap of approximately one / two days before symptoms began. Coupled with bloody diarrhoea, and tenderness in the RIF, the history fits well with a diagnosis of campylobacter infection. Faeces should be sent for microscopy and culture to confirm the diagnosis. The disease is usually self limiting and antibiotics are not needed, although response to azithromycin and erythromycin has been demonstrated. Amoebic dysentery is associated with a longer incubation period of seven days or greater, and a history of travel would be expected. Norovirus is associated with marked diarrhoea and vomiting without blood, limited to a period of 24-36hrs. E coli 157 and salmonella may also be associated with bloody diarrhoea, but a slightly shorter incubation period of only 12hrs may be seen for salmonella, and with E coli 157, diarrhoea is initially not bloody, but may become so after 1-3 days."

infectious diseases,150,A 29-year-old woman who is known to have one episode of severe allergy to egg protein in childhood comes to the vaccination clinic for review. She is travelling with her partner to South America and inquires about which vaccinations she is able to have. Which of the following vaccinations should definitely be avoided?,Hepatitis A,MMR,Recombinant influenza vaccine,Typhoid,Yellow fever,E,"The answer is yellow fever. Yellow fever vaccine contains significant amounts of egg protein and as such should be avoided in patients with egg anaphylaxis. If travel to a country where a yellow fever vaccination certificate is needed is planned, it is crucial that documentary evidence as to why vaccination is contraindicated. You should also counsel patients about avoiding travel to areas where the incidence of yellow fever is known to be high. The MMR vaccine can be safely given to individuals who have a severe egg allergy, as the vaccine is grown on chick cells and not the egg white or yolk. Egg protein is not involved in the production process for Hepatitis A, typhoid or recombinant influenza vaccines.

Treatment is usually with pentavalent antimonial drugs."
infectious diseases,152,"A 32-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department after his partner called an ambulance. He has deteriorated significantly over the past few days, having suffered headaches, drowsiness and increasing confusion. That morning on waking he was unable to move his left arm.  On further questioning of his partner, it transpires he has slowly deteriorated with a chronic cough, weight loss and intermittent night sweats over the past four months. He admits they have had unprotected sexual intercourse with other males during a holiday approximately one year ago. On examination his BP is 145/80, pulse is 88 and regular. On neurological examination he is drowsy and confused, mumbling when you ask him to perform tasks. There is bilateral papilloedema on fundoscopy, he appears to be in pain on neck flexion, and is neglecting his left hand side. CT shows meningeal enhancement and evidence of hydrocephalus. You suspect cryptococcal meningitis as a result of HIV, and would like to test him for HIV. Which of the following is the recommended course of action s as the patient is unable to give informed consented to be tested?",He cannot be tested until he is able to give consent,The hospital solicitor should decide if testing is appropriate,You may test him to allow appropriate therapy to be prescribed,You must ask his partner for permission to test,You must ask his direct blood relative for permission to test,C,"The answer is you may test him to allow appropriate therapy to be prescribed. In this situation, guidelines suggest testing is possible without patient consent if it may impact on therapy choices. Although HIV testing may not necessarily influence anti-fungal prescription, it may direct use of a high-dose amphotericin B regimen, (1 mg/kg vs 0.7 mg/kg), or use of the high dose fluconazole flucytosine combination approach. Earlier institution of HAART may also improve the response to antifungals and prevent further opportunistic infections. Not testing until he is able to give consent risks not optimising therapy as early as possible, raising the possibility of under or overuse of appropriate pharmaceutical interventions. Nobody else is able to give consent for a patient. Whilst you might want to discuss the situation with your hospital legal team if there are concerns from the patient's partner or other relatives, it is inappropriate to delay testing in this situation whilst gaining a legal opinion.

infectious diseases,153,Following a splenectomy which one of the following is the patient at risk of infection with?,Influenza A,CMV,Streptococcus pneumoniae,Gonorrhoea,Staphylococcus aureus,C,"Post splenectomy the patient is at risk of over whelming sepsis secondary to encapsulated organisms i.e. meningococcus, streptococcus and H. influenzae."
infectious diseases,154,"An 18-year-old student presented to hospital two days after returning from visiting family in India. Within twenty-four hours of his return to the United Kingdom, he suddenly developed profuse watery diarrhoea. Initially, he did not have any nausea, vomiting or stomach cramps, but these developed within a day. He described the diarrhoea as looking like cloudy water but without any blood or mucus. He was opening his bowels over 20 times per day. On examination he looked pale; he was afebrile. Skin turgor was reduced and mucous membranes were dry. Stool culture revealed a growth of Vibrio cholerae. Which is the most appropriate antibiotic to administer?",Ceftriaxone,Doxycycline,Meropenem,Metronidazole,Piperacillin plus gentamicin,B,"Cholera has a short incubation period of 24-48 hours. The illness begins with the sudden onset of painless, watery diarrhoea. The diarrhoea may be accompanied later by abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. Patients are usually afebrile. The diarrhoea is typically described as having the appearance of rice water and a faintly fishy smell. The diarrhoea may be copious and result in hypovolaemic shock unless fluids are administered.  The primary aim of treatment is to restore fluid balance; antibiotics have a secondary role. However, antibiotics have been shown to reduce fluid loss and hasten clearance of the organism from the gut.  Appropriate antibiotics include:  Tetracycline Doxycycline Ciprofloxacin Erythromycin Co-trimoxazole.  Tetracycline is usually the first line drug of choice, although resistance is emerging in certain parts of the world."
infectious diseases,155,A back packer has just returned from India and presents to his GP with a sore throat. He initially felt like he had a cold and then noticed a very severe sore throat and difficultly swallowing. He feels pyrexial and unwell. On examination there appears to be a pseudomembrane over his pharynx and he has enlarged cervical lymph nodes giving him a bull neck appearance. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Diphtheria,Infectious mononucleosis,Oral candidiasis,Viral tonsillitis,Bacterial tonsillitis,A,The most likely diphtheria given the pseudomembrane over the pharynx and the bull neck appearance. This may be mistaken with infectious mononucleosis which leads to enlarged cervical nodes. Tonsillitis can also lead to an exudate although it is usually not as severe as the one observed in diphtheria. With oral candidiasis there may be other plaques within the mouth usually and the patient is not unwell. The clue is if the patient has visited an area where diphtheria has not been completely eradicated. Diphtheria toxin can lead to cardiomyopathy and myocarditis 10 to 14 days after onset. Thrombocytopenia and nephritis and proteinuria can also occur. It is essential that antitoxin be commenced within 48 hours of onset to prevent the complications. IV benzylpenicillin should also be commenced. Tracheostomy may be required if the exudate is severe and there is respiratory obstruction.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
",Hepatitis B,Infectious Mononucleosis,Streptococcal Throat Infection,HIV Seroconversion,Viral Pharyngitis,B,"The history and clinical findings are highly indicative of epstein barr virus. There is often cervical lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly and a mild derangement of LFTs can occur. In EBV infection there is abnormal lymphocytes and heterophile antibodies are produced. The monospot test or paul bunnell test are utilised to identify these antibodies and make the diagnosis. Treatment is supportive and alcohol should be avoided. Amoxicillin should be avoided as it can lead to a maculopapular rash which is itchy. Complications include myocarditis, spelnic rupture (avoid exercise), haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, glomerulonephritis and nuerurological such as aseptic meningitis."
infectious diseases,157,"A 23-year-old aid worker returns from a spell working alongside locals in a river delta area of Thailand. During his journey home he developed profuse watery diarrhoea with nausea and vomiting. He opened his bowels some 30 times during the flight. Despite the airline staff trying to give him regular fluids he faints on his arrival in the United Kingdom and is brought to the Emergency Department. On examination, his BP is 130/70 mmHg, with a pulse of 90. He has a postural drop of 30 mmHg on standing. There is diffuse abdominal tenderness and very active bowel sounds. Investigations show:    Hb 141 g/L (13.0 - 18.0)   WCC 11.2 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   PLT 395 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Na 144 mmol/L (137 - 144)   K 3.1 mmol/L (3.5 - 4.9   Cr 199 μmol/L (60 - 110)   Urea 15.1 mmol/L (2.5 - 7.5)    Which of the following is the most important initial therapy?",Ciprofloxacin,Doxycycline,Fluid resuscitation,Metronidazole,Penicillin,C,"This man has evidence of severe dehydration. The suspicion is that he may have cholera, the risk of which is increased according to length of stay in an endemic area, and exposure to poorly cooked/infected seafood. Fluid resuscitation is the mainstay of therapy for the condition which can lead to severe dehydration as evidenced here by the marked elevation in creatinine and urea. Antibiotics may play a role in shortening the duration of clinical symptoms and impacting on excretion of Vibrio but they are not the mainstay of treatment. Thus, all of the other options are incorrect. In some cases of severe disease, however, tetracyclines or quinolones may be considered."
infectious diseases,158,"A 47-year-old woman with a history of asthma is referred with deteriorating symptoms from a lower respiratory tract infection. She has been laid up in bed for the whole of the previous week with influenza, but most recently, as her upper respiratory symptoms have improved, she has begun to develop a cough productive of purulent blood-stained sputum and has severe right lower pleuritic chest pain. On examination she is pyrexial 38.2°C, her BP is 105/65 mmHg, and her pulse is 108. There is right-sided consolidation.

Staphylococcal pneumonia is known to cause cavitation and occurs with increased frequency after influenza. As such it is the most likely cause here. Klebsiella pneumonia occurs with increased frequency in alcoholics. This may be due to a specific deficiency in bacterial immunity related to alcohol abuse. Flucloxacillin or IV vancomycin may be reasonable antibiotic choices in this case. Legionella is commonly seen in immunocompromised patients with mutlilobar changes.  Streptococcus is a gram positive organism whereas Klebsiella is a gram negative organism commonly seen in alcoholic patients with pneumonia, likley following aspiration."

infectious diseases,160,A 7-year-old child is being investigating for TB. His parents don’t agree for taking a BAL (broncho-alveolar lavage). what other sample will show growth of the organism?,Blood test,Throat swab,Gastric washing,Mantoux test,CSF,C,Sputum can not be obtained in extreems of age as in too young or elderly. When initial dry cough of TB sputum may not be coughed up by patients as well. So in such cases bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) can demonstrate the bacteria. If BAL is refused alternate other procedure as gastric washing cann be done. When patient coughs the saliva is contaminated with coughed up droplets and swallowed by the patient. So gastric lavage can brig these organisms with samples of gastric washing
infectious diseases,161,"A 44-year-old man with advanced HIV/AIDS presents with a two-week history of fever, weight loss (8 kg) and sweats. His latest CD4 T-lymphocyte count (taken four weeks previously) was 20 cells/mm^3. He had failed multiple regimens of antiretroviral therapy and was not currently taking any prescribed medications other than co-trimoxazole as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia. Investigations:    Hb 82 g/L (130-180)   Total WBC 2.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 75 ×10^9/L (150-400)    A bone marrow aspirate showed acid/alcohol fast bacilli on light microscopy. Which one of the following mycobacteria is the most likely cause of his presenting illness?",Mycobacterium avium,Mycobacterium bovis,Mycobacterium chelonae,Mycobacterium fortuitum,Mycobacterium marinum,A,"Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis are classified as 'typical' mycobacteria that cause a similar spectrum of disease. As its name suggests, M. bovis also causes disease in cattle and the usual source of human infection was from drinking contaminated milk; this is now rare. BCG is a live attenuated vaccine derived from a strain of M. bovis. BCG is currently used as a form of immunotherapy for treating bladder cancer; several cases of disseminated M. bovis infection (systemic 'BCG-it is') have been described as a result of systemic infection following this treatment. The other organisms listed are non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM); sometimes referred to as 'atypical' mycobacteria. They differ from M. tuberculosis in that they are ubiquitous organisms and have no person-to-person spread. Mycobacterium avium (also known as Mycobacterium avium complex [MAC], or Mycobacterium avium intracellulare [MAI]) causes disseminated infection in patients with advanced HIV, typically when the CD4 count is less than 50 cells/mm^3. This is a disseminated infection that usually causes symptoms of fatigue, weight loss and fevers. Bone marrow infiltration is typical and patients are often anaemic and/or pancytopaenic. The diagnosis is best made from bone marrow aspiration and culture. It may also be detected in blood cultures. M. fortuitum, and M. chelonae typically present as painful papular, nodular or ulcerating skin lesions. Both are classified as rapidly growing mycobacteria and infect immunocompetent individuals. It is a natural environmental organism that has been found in water sources, sewage and dirt. Other manifestations include osteomyelitis, lymphadenitis, and ocular disease (keratitis and corneal ulceration), usually a result of wound contamination after trauma. Disseminated disease may be seen in immunosuppressed patients. Mycobacterium marinum infection occurs when contaminated water is exposed to skin that has experienced open trauma. It is an uncommon infection that is usually seen in patients who handle fish or swim in freshwater or saltwater. The skin is the most common site of infection, where it usually produces a solitary indolent granulomatous lesion - the 'fish tank granuloma'."

On examination she was febrile, temperature 38.3°C. The right ankle was swollen and very tender with a reduced range of movement. Which of the following investigations would be of most help in establishing the diagnosis?",Aspiration of the right ankle,Blood cultures,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate,Serum urate level,x Ray of the right ankle,A,"Septic arthritis is a medical emergency and this is the most likely diagnosis in this case. It is essential that the joint is aspirated in order to establish a microbiological diagnosis that will guide appropriate treatment. All of the other investigations listed would be of value in managing this patient, but in this setting joint aspiration is critical to rule out a septic joint and identify the causative organism to aid in antimicrobial treatment."

Which of the following booking times before surgery should he be given to receive his pneumococcal vaccination?,Three days,One week,Four weeks,Two months,Three months,C,"Patients should be vaccinated with an appropriate pneumococcal vaccination at least two weeks prior to surgery to allow the maximal humoral immune response. If they have not received the Haemophilus influenzae or meningococcal vaccinations, then they should also receive these. In cases of emergency splenectomy related to trauma, patients should be vaccinated as early as possible after surgery. Patients who have undergone splenectomy are at significantly increased risk of infection from all three of these bacteria without vaccination. They should also be enrolled in the yearly seasonal flu vaccination programme post splenectomy. "
infectious diseases,167,Which is true of herpes simplex encephalitis?,Brain MRI is characteristically normal,Fits are uncommon,Genital herpes is usually present,Temporal lobe involvement is common,Viral identification using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on CSF is non-specific,D,"Both herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2 can cause encephalitis. Type 2 is characterised by generalised brain involvement, but is almost exclusively seen in neonates who acquire the virus during delivery. Herpes simplex type 1 is the virus associated with encephalitis in older children and adults. This form is associated with high signal in one or both temporal lobes (limbic encephalitis), in particular, the anterior temporal lobes. These abnormalities are visible on CT or MRI.   Seizures are commonly present in herpes simplex encephalitis.  Genital herpes is caused by herpes simplex type 2 and is such not classically associated with adult encephalitis.   PCR for herpes simplex virus on cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is a highly specific test. Other CSF findings are lymphocytosis and mildly raised red cells.  If the diagnosis of herpes simplex encephalitis is suspected it is critical to start aciclovir intravenously as soon as possible."

Tuberculosis,N. Meningitidis,D,The finding of mononuclear cells in the presence of bacterial levels of protein and glucose are highly suggestive of TB.
infectious diseases,170,"A 43-year-old Pakistani female presents with a two-month history of weight loss, fever and night sweats. Chest x ray reveals a large right sided pleural effusion. What investigation is most likely to confirm a diagnosis of suspected TB?",CT scan of thorax,Interferon gamma releasing assay (IGRA),Pleural aspirate,Pleural biopsy,Sputum analysis,D,"Pleural tuberculosis (TB) typically presents with pleurisy, pleuritic chest pain, cough, fever and a small to moderate unilateral pleural effusion. Investigation should include a chest radiograph and sputum cultures initially. However, 50% of patients will have no radiographic evidence of parenchymal disease and only 20-30% of sputum cultures will be negative. Tuberculin skin tests can be falsely negative and are therefore not reliable. CT scan findings are non-specific, and interferon gamma releasing assays are positive in previous exposure to TB as well as active infection and are therefore non-specific. Pleural fluid can be aspirated and should be sent for acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture, cell count and differential, protein, LDH, glucose and pH. This typically shows an exudative effusion that is lymphocyte-predominant and has a low glucose level. The adenosine deaminase level is often elevated, but rarely available to test in clinical practice. As the majority of these pleural fluid findings are non-specific, and AFBs are not reliably seen in every test, pleural fluid aspirate seldom confirms a diagnosis of TB. The test most likely to confirm the diagnosis of TB is, therefore, a pleural biopsy. This allows microbiology, pathology and cytology investigation, and can obtain a TB isolate for susceptibility testing. Susceptibility testing is important as detection of resistance alters the combination of drugs and duration of treatment. The combination of AFB culture and histology (granulomas) from pleural biopsy is the most sensitive to diagnose pleural TB."
infectious diseases,171,Deficiency of which of the following components of the complement system predisposes to infection with Neisseria meningitidis?,C1q,C1r,C1s,C3,C4,D,"The complement system often gives rise to questions in the MRCP examination. It would be wise to make a cursory review of this topic. C3 is the point at which the classical, alternative, and lectin complement pathways converge. C1qrs, C2, and C4 are strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Patients with C3 deficiency, be it absolute, relative, genetically determined (autosomal dominant or recessive), or due to properdin deficiency, are predisposed to recurrent infection with encapsulated proteins, particularly N. meningitidis. C5 deficiency is associated with Leiner's disease, a syndrome of recurrent diarrhoea, wasting, and generalised seborrhoeic dermatitis presenting in infants."

infectious diseases,173,"A 52-year-old woman was admitted with malaise and leg weakness. Her illness started with a sore throat while travelling in eastern Europe. On examination, she was febrile (39.1°C) with several areas of exudates on her pharynx and extensive cervical lymphadenopathy. There was weakness of the legs with absent tendon reflexes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute myeloid leukaemia ,Cytomegalovirus infection,Diphtheria ,Glandular fever ,Streptococcal tonsillitis ,C,"This history of severe exudative pharyngitis in a person who has recently travelled to eastern Europe is highly suggestive of diphtheria. The disease, caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, causes a severe pharyngitis with extensive soft tissue swelling and lymphadenitis that produces a characteristic 'bull neck' appearance. Exotoxins produced by the organism may cause myocarditis or neurological defects. The degree of neurological toxicity varies but may be severe, causing cranial neuropathies, predominantly motor peripheral neuropathy (occasionally sensory neuropathy). An epidemic of diphtheria began in Russia in the early 1990s and remains a significant public health problem in Russia and in the former Soviet states."
infectious diseases,174,Which of the following concerning IgG is correct?,It comprises the majority of circulating antibody in serum,It differs from other isotypes in not being able to cross the placental barrier,"It has a molecular weight of 50,000 kd",It is monovalent,It is the major antibody produced during the primary response,A,"Normal range 8-19 g/L. Next is IgA, 1-5 g/L, followed by IgM 0.5-2 g/L. It is, in fact, the only antibody capable of crossing the placental barrier, which it does through gaining attachment via its Fc portion. Each light chain has a molecular weight (MW) of 25,000 and each H chain a MW of 50,000. Therefore, since the whole molecule consists of 2 L and 2 H chains, the MW is 150,000 kd. It exists as a monomer with 2 Fab portions, each of which can interact with an antigenic determinant. Therefore it is divalent. It is the major antibody produced in the secondary immune response. IgM is the major antibody produced during the primary response."
infectious diseases,175,"A 48-year-old man with a known history of chronic alcohol abuse presented with a three-day history of fevers, night sweats and a cough productive of purulent sputum. There was no past history of respiratory disease. On examination, he was febrile (39.1°C). Percussion note was dull over the right apex and there was bronchial breathing in this area on auscultation. The chest x ray showed right upper lobar consolidation. Other investigations revealed:    WBC 23 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 18.3 ×10^9/L (1.5-7)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aspiration pneumonia,Klebsiella pneumonia,Legionella pneumonia,Mycoplasma pneumonia,Primary tuberculosis,B,"Community-acquired Klebsiella pneumonia is a disease of debilitated middle-aged and older men with alcoholism. Mortality rates are as high as 50% regardless of treatment Klebsiella pneumonia characteristically affects one of the upper lobes of the lung, although infection of the lower lobes is not uncommon. There is an increased tendency toward abscess formation. Aspiration pneumonia typically affects in right lower lobe in patients with impaired swallowing. Legionnaires' disease is associated with contaminated air conditioning and water delivery systems. Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections have an insidious onset with malaise, myalgia, sore throat and headache. Cough is characteristically dry. Chest x ray (CXR) changes are usually patchy and involve the lower or middle lobes. Primary TB does not commonly cause a lobar pneumonia, therefore whilst it is a possibility it is not the most likely diagnosis."
infectious diseases,176,Which of the following is true of the T cell response to antigen?,A process of affinity maturation of the T cell receptor occurs,Cooperation with other cell types is required for T cell recognition of antigen,Gamma/delta + T cells respond to antigen presented in association with MHC class II molecules,Intact antigen is presented in association with self MHC molecules,Interactions of the TcR with an appropriate Ag/MHC complex activates a resting T cell,B,"Affinity maturation of an ongoing immune response is a feature of the antibody response. There is no evidence that a similar process occurs in the T cell response. T cells recognise antigen only when presented by (self) MHC molecules on an antigen presenting cell. MHC class II molecules present antigen to CD4+, alpha/beta+ T cells. It is still not clear how gamma/delta+ T cells recognise antigen, however, most gamma/delta+ T cells do not appear to be restricted by (self) MHC molecules. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules present short antigen-derived peptides, not the intact antigen. Additional 'costimulatory' signals are required to activate a resting T cell. Interaction of the T cell reactor (TcR) of a resting T cell with an appropriate Ag/MHC complex in the absence of costimulatory signals may lead to the induction of anergy."
infectious diseases,177,Of which of the following is chronic leg ulceration a recognised feature?,Hypothyroidism,Macroglobulinaemia,Marfan's syndrome,Pernicious anaemia,Rheumatoid arthritis,E,"In rheumatoid arthritis the incidence of leg ulceration is about 8%. It is the most common cause of leg ulceration after chronic venous disease and peripheral arterial disease. Other associations with leg ulceration: Macroglobulinaemia: At cold temperatures cryoglobulins precipitate causing complement activation. This causes a vasculitis. The inflammation results in vascular purpura and livedo (marbling appearance). This is described as livedoid vasculitis. The classical triad is a palpable peripheral vasculitis, arthralgia and muscle weakness. Hereditary spherocytosis: Ulceration is rare in but should be considered in young patients with no identified risk factors. Erythematous lesions may develop after episodes of haemolysis. Sickle cell anaemia: Leg ulceration develops in 25-75% of patients. There may be ischaemia due to thrombosis of small vessels. Ulceration may start with minor trauma. The ulcers are very difficult and slow to heal. Up to 97% will recur in a year."
infectious diseases,178,A patient presents with a 36-hour history of varicella zoster in the T4 dermatome. She complains of severe pain in the skin supplied by T4. What is the most appropriate management?,Aciclovir,Carbamazepine,Famciclovir,Nothing,Prednisolone,A,"Aciclovir and famciclovir may be used to treat herpes zoster. They both reduce time to healing and resolution of associated pain. Aciclovir is now a generic medication and therefore will be cheaper than famciclovir and is the most cost effective of the treatments listed. Early use of steroids in herpes zoster may also reduce the amount of analgesia required and the length of illness. A clinical review of the treatment of herpes zoster was included in the BMJ^1 in 2003. The main take home message was that appropriate treatment of herpes zoster can control acute symptoms and reduce the risk of longer-term complications. In March 2010, NICE updated their guidance^2 on the treatment of neuropathic pain. First line treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia would now include amitriptyline or pregabalin. CKS have also issued guidance^3 on the treatment of herpes zoster. This guidance is generally in keeping with that issued by NICE. They add that, although carbamazepine has evidence to support its use^4 in the treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia, the potential for serious adverse side effects and the lack of a licence has prevented them from recommending it as a primary care treatment.

infectious diseases,179,"A 25-year-old woman presented with a history of confusion and fever that had worsened gradually over the preceding four days. On examination, she was drowsy and had mild neck stiffness. Neurological examination revealed an extensor left plantar response. A CT scan of her brain showed an area of low attenuation in the right temporo-parietal region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cerebral toxoplasmosis,Herpes simplex encephalitis,Listerial meningoencephalitis,Pneumococcal meningitis,Pyogenic brain abscess,B,"Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) often presents subacutely over several days with declining cerebral function. The temporal or temporo-parietal regions are affected earlier and neuro-imaging usually demonstrates this. However, temporal lobe involvement is not pathognomonic of HSE. Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the result of reactivation of toxoplasmosis in severely immunocompromised individuals. Listeriosis is associated with the consumption of soft cheese. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes acute pyogenic meningitis and is often associated with suppurative otitis media or sinusitis. Brain abscesses are usually readily demonstrable by cranial CT scans."
infectious diseases,180,"A 25-year-old-man presented with severe headache, myalgia and a blanching red macular rash. He had returned from Indonesia three days previously.

Which of the following would be given immediately?",A single dose of ivermectin,Intravenous hydrocortisone 200 mg,Intravenous normal saline,Metronidazole,Tetracycline,C,"Dengue is transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquito in endemic areas. There are four serotypes. Re-infection with a different serotype aggravates the infection and is associated with serious complications such as dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS).

The second rash which looks like measles and is morbilliform, maculopapular, sparing palms and soles. Do not confuse dengue fever with dengue haemorrhagic fever. "
infectious diseases,181,"A 25-year-old Turkish woman arrived in the United Kingdom with a three-month history of weight loss and intermittent fevers. On examination, the patient was emaciated, febrile (39°C) and pale, and an enlarged liver (5 cm below the costal margin) and spleen (10 cm below the costal margin) were present. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 72 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 2.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 117 ×10^9/L (150-400)    Thick and thin films no parasites identified. CXR normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",HIV infection,Infectious mononucleosis,Malaria,Miliary tuberculosis,Visceral leishmaniasis,E,"The clinical history given here is typical of visceral leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a vector-bourne disease caused by obligate intra-macrophage protozoa, transmitted to humans by phlebotomine sandflies. It is endemic in large areas of the tropics, subtropics and Mediterranean basin. There are four main clinical syndromes: cutaneous, mucocutaneous, visceral (also known as kala-azar) and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. In cutaneous leishmaniasis patients generally present with ulcers or nodules. These usually heal spontaneously, but slowly, in immunocompetent individuals with resultant disfiguring scars. Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is characterised by progressively destructive ulcerations of the mucosa extending from the nose and mouth to the pharynx and larynx, which are not self-healing. Leishmania braziliensis is responsible for the majority of these cases. Post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis is characterised by a macular, maculopapular or nodular rash and is a complication of visceral leishmaniasis frequently observed after treatment. It can also occur in immunosuppressed individuals and is highly infectious. Visceral leishmaniasis, as described here, is fatal if left untreated. It is caused by the Leishmania donovani complex (L. donovani sensu stricto in East Africa and India, and L. infantum in Europe, North Africa and Latin America). Following an incubation period of 2-6 months, patients present with persistent systemic infection (fever, malaise, loss of appetite and weight loss) and parasitic infection of the blood and reticulo-endothelial system (resulting in lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly). Anaemia is usually caused by persistent inflammation and hypersplenism and can be exacerbated by bleeding. Diagnosis can be difficult. Pancytopenia is often present and is supportive of the diagnosis. There is also often marked polyclonal hypergammaglobulinaemia. Visualisation of the parasite (amastigote form) from lymph nodes, bone marrow or spleen is used as a confirmatory test. PCR can be used to detect the parasite in the blood. Anti-leishmanial antibodies can be detected, but they remain positive up to several years after cure and therefore cannot be used to detect relapse. In addition, there is a significant incidence of asymptomatic infection, and therefore seroprevalence in healthy populations. Treatment of visceral leishmaniasis relies on specific therapies and aggressive management of concomitant infection, anaemia, hypovolaemia and malnutrition. First line antimonials are sodium stibogluconate and meglumine antimoniate. Adverse effects include cardiac arrhythmias and acute pancreatitis. Amphotericin B is increasingly being used. Vaccines are being developed, and novel drugs (including miltefosine and paromomycin) have been introduced. An elimination programmed has been introduced to the Indian subcontinent. Whilst opportunistic infections in HIV can present like this, there are no other indications in the question to suggest this is the diagnosis. The history is too long for infectious mononucleosis. Malaria is not common in Turkey, and we are told there are no parasites seen (although remember 3 negative films are needed to exclude the diagnosis). Miliary TB is a possibility but does not classically cause this level of hepatosplenomegaly. "

She has large palpable cervical lymph nodes bilaterally. Her pharynx was inflamed with areas of exudate on the pharyngeal wall. Neurological examination revealed global weakness of both legs and absent reflexes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cytomegalovirus infection,Diphtheria,Epstein-Barr virus infection,Hodgkin’s disease,Streptococcal tonsillitis,B,"The breakdown of healthcare services in the former USSR was associated with a major resurgence of diphtheria. Pharyngeal diphtheria presents with:  fever sore throat cervical lymphadenopathy, and an adherent, grayish pharyngeal membrane.  The diphtheria toxin causes cardio- and neurotoxicity.

He was a non-smoker and had difficulty expectorating. Investigation revealed a HbA1c of 53 mmol/mol (20-42) but his chest x ray showed a cavitating left apical shadow. Which of the following investigations would be most useful in establishing the cause of this lesion?,Bronchoscopy,CT scan of the chest,Gastric aspirate for acid-fast bacilli,Percutaneous lung biopsy,Sputum for acid-fast bacilli,A,"The differential diagnosis of cavitating lung lesions is shown below. The most likely diagnosis in this non-smoking man is post primary tuberculosis as a result of reactivation of quiescent disease. He has several risk factors including increasing age and diabetes. The patient is unable to produce sputum, therefore, undertaking a bronchoscopy with bronchial washings for microscopy staining and culture is the investigation of choice. Gastric lavage for AFB is unpleasant for the patient has a lower yield than bronchoscopy and is therefore rarely undertaken now. Causes of cavitating masses on CXR:  lung abscess tuberculosis fungal infection (e.g., histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis) malignancy Granulomatosis with polyangiitis commonly rheumatoid arthritis (multiple), and infarction.  Bronchoscopy is the least invsive and lower risk option compared to percutaneous biopsy and this should be performed first."

He states this began as a small, firm reddish blue lesion. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Orf,Wart,Molluscum contagiosum,Herpes zoster,Herpes simplex,A,Orf is caused by a parapox virus which is contracted from sheep and goats. It causes usually solitary lesions although they can be multiple. They commonly being as a small firm reddish blue lesion then develop into flat topped blood tinged pustule.
infectious diseases,186,"A 25 year old gentleman has recently returned from travelling around Asia.  He presents to his GP as he is feeling unwell with a headache, cough and myalgia.  He has also noticed a fever which comes and goes every couple of days.  On examination there is evidence of hepatosplenomegaly, fever and jaundice. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Malaria secondary to plasmodium malariae,Malaria secondary to plasmodium ovale,Typhoid,Dengue fever,Malaria secondary to plasmodium falciparum,B,Whenever a patient returns from an area where malaria is endemic then this is the diagnosis until proven otherwise.  Typhoid initially presents with fever but there tends to be diarrhoea and vomiting.  In dengue fever there is usually an associated rash.  For the diagnosis of malaria thin and thick blood smears stained with Giemsa remain the gold standard. Even if the film is negative 2 further smears are required before this is excluded.  PCR and other rapid diagnostic tests are available but are expensive. Malaria is caused by the plasmodium species which are transmitted by the bite of a female anopheles mosquito.  There are four main plasmodium which cause malaria.  P. falciparum leads to the most severe disease and can lead to cerebral malaria and acute renal failure with classically a tertian fever.  P. vivax leads to tertian fever and can relapse due to hypnozoites in the liver. Similarly p. ovalve is relatively beingn but can relapse.  P. malariae classically leads to a fever every 4th day and can lead to nephrotic syndrome. P. ovale and P.vivax are most likely to present after 6 months.
infectious diseases,187,"A 58-year-old man is admitted to the Emergency Department some five days after becoming unwell with influenza. Over the past 48 hours he has become progressively more short of breath with a cough productive of purulent and bloody sputum. On examination he is pyrexial 38.6 °C, his BP is 95/60 mmHg, pulse is 95 and regular. His saturations are 93% on air. There are signs of extensive right sided consolidation. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 134 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 14.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 191 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 135 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.1 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 132 µmol/L (79-118)    CXR shows right sided consolidation with evidence of cavitation. Which of the following is the most appropriate therapy?",Benzylpenicillin,Ciprofloxacin,Clarithromycin and co-amoxiclav,Doxycycline,Flucloxacillin,C,"This gentleman has community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The recent history of influenza may lead you to consider Staphylococcus aureus as the possible underlying organism, although this is an uncommon cause of CAP in the UK. It is more common in the winter months and coincident influenza-type symptoms in approximately 40%. Pneumonia complications approximately 3% of cases of influenza, 10% of those admitted have been confirmed to be due to Staphyloccus aureus. In the majority of patients, CAP should be confirmed by chest radiography before the commencement of antibiotics. However, if patients are critically unwell they should be treated for the presumptive diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment should always be initiated within four hours of presentation. CAP caused by Staphyloccus aureus is more likely to present with multilobar shadowing, cavitation, pneumatoceles and spontaneous pneumothorax than other organisms. However, there are no characteristic features of chest radiographs that allow a confident prediction of the likely pathogen. Therefore, the general guidelines for treatment of CAP should be followed until an organism is identified. Staphylococcus aureus carries a high mortality, and therefore if suspected treatment should initially be for a severe CAP (see below for details). Low severity CAP (CURB 0-1) can be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg TDS PO. CURB 2 CAP should be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg-1 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg TDS. Alternatives are available if patients are allergic to any of the above combinations. High severity CAP (CURB 3-5) should be treated as soon as possible with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. The oral route is recommended in those with low and moderate severity CAP. Patients treated with parenteral antibiotics initially should be switched to an oral regimen once clinical improvement is seen and the patients has been afebrile for at least 24 hours. For most patients with uncomplicated CAP 7 days of antibiotic treatment is recommended. For those with high severity pneumonia where an organism has not been identified, 7-10 days treatment is indicated and extended to 14-21 days where clinically needed. If Staphylococcus aureus is identified, treatment should be altered. Non-MRSA organisms should be treatment with flucloxacillin and/or rifampicin; an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients is teicoplanin and rifampicin. MRSA should be treated with vancomycin. A prolonged antibiotic course is indicated. "
infectious diseases,188,"An 18 year old female is brought to A and E very unwell with a high fever, a macular and erythrodermic rash, myalgia and diarrhoea and vomiting. She is hypotensive. She is thought to have a tampon retained. She is transferred to ITU as she is found to be in Acute renal, liver and respiratory failure. 10 days after the onset there was desquamation of the palms and soles. Which of the following is not useful in the management?",Ciprofloxacin,Cephalosporins,Penicillin V,Vancomycin,Clindamycin,A,"This presentation is highly suggestive of toxic shock syndrome. The desquamation is a clue and retained tampon is a known risk factor. Multi organ failure is another component of toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is thought to be caused by staphylococcal aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. There is production of exotoxins which are thought to act as superantigens (do not require processing by antigen presenting cells), leading to massive activation of T cells and cytokine production. Beta lactams and clindamycin are useful in the management. Vancomycin may be required for staphylococcal infection where there is a penicillin allergy."

infectious diseases,194,A 64 year male was treated with clindamycin for skin boils. These have resolved however a nasal swab reveals MRSA which is Panton-Valentine Leukocidin positive. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?,Nil required,Treat with flucloxacillin,Chlorhexidine wash and Nasal Mupirocin,Retreat with Rifampicin and Doxycycline,Retreat with Rifampicin,C,Some S. Aureus are increasingly being found to produce the toxin Panton-Valentine Leukocidin. It leads to skin and subcutaneous infections such as boils or can be more severe and cause a necrotising pneumonia or osteomyelitis. Many PVL S. Aureus are sensitive to antibiotics such as flucloxacillin. For those who are MRSA and PVL positive then rifampicin plus doxycycline or clindamycin can be utilised. Once treated if swabs are positive but no clinical features are evident then it is appropriate to decolonise with nasal mupirocin and chlorhexidine.

He is passing liquid bloody stools 10 times daily. He has a history of HIV and is on HAART. His CD4 count has been well controlled, above 400 cells/µL. What is the cause for his diarrhoea?",Appendicitis,Antiretroviral medication,Campylobacter,Cryptosporidium parvum,Cytomegalovirus,C,"Campylobacter infection usually presents with bloody diarrhoea and 'pseudoappendicitis' (RIF pain). The patients often have a prodrome of fever, headache and myalgia. Campylobacter takes around seven to 10 days to incubate. Both Cryptosporidium and Cytomegalovirus are found in patients with CD4 count less than 300 cells/µL. It causes chronic diarrhoea (more than four week's duration). Patients commencing on antiretroviral medication may suffer with diarrhoea. It usually is self-limiting, lasting two to four weeks, and would not be associated with prodrome as in this case. Given this gentleman's HIV status an infective cause for his diarrhoea is more likely than appendicitis."

infectious diseases,203,"A 22-year-old student comes to the Emergency Department with jaundice, right upper quadrant pain, nausea and vomiting. He recently returned from a trip to Thailand 12 days ago and maintains that he had all appropriate vaccinations and was compliant with anti-malarial therapy. He is usually well, takes no regular medication, drinks 10 units of alcohol per week and smokes 5 cigarettes per day. On examination, his BP is 105/80, pulse is 88 and regular, his temperature is 37.9 °C, and he has jaundiced sclerae. There are scratch marks over the upper body and abdomen. His abdomen is soft, although there is obvious hepatic tenderness on palpation.

Given that no risk-taking behaviour has been described in the scenario, and this patient maintains they are up to date and compliant with vaccinations and travel medicines, viral hepatitis transmitted via the faeco-oral route, not covered by the vaccination schedule, is the most likely cause of his presentation. Hepatitis E presents with a similar clinical picture to hepatitis A, with a short flu like illness, followed by acute hepatitis. Incubation period ranges from 15 to 60 days, and symptoms are generally reported as slightly more severe compared to hepatitis A. Hepatitis A vaccination is highly effective and is recommended for travel to South East Asia, as such it is unlikely he has hepatitis A infection. There is no documented exposure to body fluids and no use of intravenous drugs, reducing the chances of this being acute hepatitis B or C. Hepatitis D infection can only be propagated in the presence of existing hepatitis B infection, making it an unlikely answer here."

She has recently seen her GP as she had some dysura and fever and andquot;was given some medication which improved the symptomsandquot;   On examination there was thick white discharge present on her vulva and vaginal walls. Which is the most likely causative organism?",Bacterial vaginosis,Candida albicans,Chlamydia trachomatis,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Trichomonas vaginalis,B,"There is very little information given in this girl's case, save for the three-day history of vaginal discharge. The first thing you can deduce is that she is very low risk for Trichomonas, Chalmydia or Gonorrhoea infection given her sexual history and partner history.  She also does not describe a foul smelling discharge which is associted with bacterial vaginosis and is grey or clear in colour. It does occasiaonaly follow antibiotic use or after cleaning withe soap or shower gel prodcuts which exacerbate the problem. Given she has likley had some antibiotics for a UTI and the examination findings the most likely diagnosis is Candida albicans or thrush. Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a clinical diagnosis based on typical features supported by laboratory confirmation of Candida sp. from a vaginal sample. Vaginal discharge in candidiasis is typically non-offensive and curdy but may be thin or absent. This is treated with oral and topical antifungals. "

He states it begin as a small bump which then ulcerated and the became a firm lesion. It is not painful. He has associated inguinal lymphadenopathy which is not painful. You suspect syphilis however his EIA, FTA abs, TPHA and VDRL are negative. Which other test if positive will confirm early primary syphilis?",Blood cultures,Negative dark ground microscopy,Repeat VDRL in a few weeks,CSF sample,Positive dark ground microscopy,E,"In early primary syphilis, antibodies can be negative. The t. pallidum EIA (enzyme immunoassay) or haemagglutination (TPHA) and fluorescent treponemal antibodies (FTA abs) are highly specific but ,may take some time to rise. VDRL are non specific but can be quantified and thus are useful in monitoring disease activity and response to treatment. If it is early in the disease then positive dark ground microscopy can be utilised to confirm the diagnosis and allow treatment to commence as antibodies may not raise for several weeks."
infectious diseases,211,"A 19-year-old man returned to the United Kingdom two weeks after working in a refugee camp in sub-Saharan Africa. On examination he was febrile, dyspnoeic and widespread inspiratory crackles were present. He had an extensive maculo-papular rash, conjunctivitis, generalised stomatitis and some bluish-grey spots on the buccal mucosa. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Epidemic typhus ,Epstein-Barr virus infection (EBV),Leptospirosis ,Measles ,Parvovirus infection,D,"Although seldom seen in countries in which a vaccine is available, measles is a major health problem in refugee camps in Africa. The clinical picture described is characteristic. The major complications of measles involve the respiratory tract and central nervous system. Pneumonia may be caused by the virus itself or through bacterial superinfection. EBV presents with fever and lymphadenopathy which is painful.  Leptospirosis often leads to abnormal liver function and myalgia.  Parvovirus leads to a mild rash and fever but in severe cases can cause anaemia."
infectious diseases,212,A 25 year old female has just returned from travelling around South America. She presents with a 3 day history of malaise and myalgia. This was followed by a severe headache and fever which came on suddenly. She has a dry cough and is complaining of abdominal pain. She has noticed a rash on her abdomen and axillae and this is starting to spread peripherally. On examination there is a non confluent erythematous rash on the abdomen and axillae. What treatment should be commenced?,Doxycycline,Chloroquine,Amoxicillin,Quinine,Fluoroquinolone,A,"The most likely diagnosis is Epidemic typhus which is caused by Rickettsia prowazekki. This is an obligate intracellular bacteria which is spread by human body louse. It is transmitted not by the bite but the contaminated faeces of the louse entering the wound and then inoculated by excoriation. It often presents with general malaise followed by a very abrupt onset of a severe headache and fever with symptoms such as dry cough and abdominal pain. There is a non confluent erythematous rash which begins centrally and spreads peripherally. The rash can become petechial after a few days. It is a vascular process which can affect numerous organs and may lead to hepatisi, pneumonia, renal failure and myocarditis. If there is severe vascular involvement then gangrene can develop. Meningoencephalitis can develop and progress. Sometimes there is evidence of conjunctivitis with orbital pain.Tick typhus is a type of spotted fever, however in rocky mountain spotted fever the rash begins peripherally and spreads centrally. Endemic Typhus is a milder disease caused by rickettsia typhus and is transmitted by fleas. In typhoid fever diarrhoea is characterisitic. Serology can be utilised to confrim the diagnosis of Typhus. High dose doxycycline or tetracycline should be commenced."

This is also known as Loeffler's syndrome. Tapeworms, of which Diphyllobothrium and Taenia are species, result in predominantly gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain and intermittent obstruction. Schistosomiasis can manifest as a cough, but symptoms are not usually as severe as those seen here. Enterobius is a species of threadworm which does not have a larval stage which affects the lungs."
infectious diseases,217,"A 36-year-old woman presents with dyspnoea, cough and fever. Crackles are heard on auscultation of the lungs.

infectious diseases,218,"An 18-year-old student comes to the Emergency Department for review. He has a severe pharyngitis with high fever which has developed over the past 24 - 48 hours. Apart from mild asthma for which he takes Seretide 50, he has no past medical history of note. On examination his BP is 105/80, pulse is 90 and regular, he is pyrexial at 38.5°C. There is cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis with exudate. His abdomen is soft and non-tender. Investigations:    Hb 130g/l 135-180   WCC 6.0x10^9/l 6-10 (atypical lymphocytes seen on film)   PLT 189 x 10^9/l 150-400   Na 140 mmol/l 135-145   K 3.7 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 105 µmol/l 60-110   CRP 65 mg/dl less than10   EBV spot test negative    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?  ",Acute myeloid leukaemia,Chronic myeloid leukaemia,Cytomegalovirus (CMV),Epstein Barr virus (EBV),Streptococcus pyogenes,D,"The answer is EBV. Given this patient's presentation with severe pharyngitis and atypical lymphocytes on the blood film, coupled with a relatively modest rise in CRP, EBV should be considered the likely diagnosis until proven otherwise. The catch here is that antibody testing has up to a 25% chance of being negative, despite active EBV infection, during the first week of symptoms. Management is supportive, and re-testing can be considered a week later. CMV is a possibility, as it can present with an infectious mononucleosis-type syndrome which mimics EBV but EBV is much more common in this situation (80% of such cases are caused by EBV). There is a wide spectrum of other presentations of CMV, including viral pneumonia, transaminitis, splenomegaly, colitis, encephalitis, cytopenia, and pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO). The rise in CRP is very modest and accompanied by atypical lymphocytes, which counts against S pyogenes as the likely cause of his symptoms. Although AML and CML do present with pharyngitis and lymphadenopathy, in percentage terms, they are much less likely to be the diagnosis here and would in all probability be associated with a much longer prodromal illness and more significant abnormalities on full blood count."
infectious diseases,219,"A 19 year old student returns from a back packing trip around Asia. He is brought to A and E very unwell. He has a fever of 41 degrees. This came on suddenly along with severe headaches, localised retroorbitally and severe myalgia and backache. A macular confluent rash appeared a few days into his admission, over his face and flexor surfaces. His conjuctivae are red. He is also complaining of abdominal pain and bleeding gums. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Yellow fever,Ebola virus,Dengue fever,Typhoid fever,Malaria,C,"Dengue fever is the most likely diagnosis. It is the most common arboviral illness transmitted worldwide. It is caused by a flavivirus transmitted by mosquitoes A. aegypti. Ebola virus can present similarly however there is not a swinging pyrexia in Ebola virus and back ache is less common and GI symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea are more common. Malaria does not tend to cause as severe myalgia or the rash. In typhoid again this does not causes a swinging pyrexia and myalgia is less severe. Jaundice is a common feature in yellow fever. People with Dengue fever are at risk of developing Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever where there is an  increase in vascular permeability with leakage of plasma leading to elevated HCT, oedema and effusions. There is also thrombocytopenia."

infectious diseases,221,Which of the following viruses is associated with human cancers?,Epstein-Barr virus,Hepatitis A virus,Mumps virus,Polio virus,Rubella virus,A,"Epstein-Barr (EBV) is associated with rare tumours, such as Burkitt's lymphoma, as well as nasopharyngeal cancers. Human papilloma (HPV) is associated with cervical carcinoma. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) are associated with hepatocellular carcinoma in association with chronic liver disease. Other tumour associated viruses are human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HLTV-1) and Kaposi's associated sarcoma virus (KSHV). There is no proven association of mumps with the subsequent development of testicular cancer. Reading: Palmer Beasley R, Lin CC, Hwang LY, Chien CS. Hepatocellular Carcinoma and Hepatitis B Virus.

infectious diseases,222,"A patient presents with jaundice. He has recently came back from Asia. He states he has not been feeling well for some weeks with a flu like illness. He has intermittent diarrhoea, fever, malaise and a headache. On examination there is tender hepatomegaly. What is the most likely diagnosis?",CMV,HIV Seroconversion,Infectious mononucleosis,Hepatitis A,Hepatitis B,D,Hepatitis A is the most likely diagnosis given the flu like illness and the jaundice. His recent visit to Asia also gives a clue to the diagnosis. Hepatitis B does not lead to these symptoms. EBV can lead to a hepatitis and flu like illness but there is normally evidence of a sore throat in addition to the other symptoms.
infectious diseases,223,"An 18-year-old male presents with a six week history of a painful swollen right knee. He had been treated for a sexually transmitted disease three months ago. On examination, there was a large effusion in the right knee. Synovial fluid analysis revealed a white cell count of 16 ×10^9/L (4-11) but culture was negative. Which one of the following organisms is the most likely cause?",Human papilloma virus,Herpes simplex,Neisseria gonorrhoeae,Treponema pallidum,Trichomonas vaginalis,C,"Bacteria are the most common cause of monoarthritis. Staphylococcus aureus and gonococci are the most common causes of septic arthritis. Neisseria gonorrhoeae typically occurs in young adults. Presentation is either as a bacteraemic form (classic triad of migratory polyarthritis, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis) which is usually polyarticular or a septic arthritis, as in this case. The septic arthritis form presents with joint symptoms which begin within days to weeks of gonococcal infection. Gram stain is positive in 25% and culture positive in 50%. This patient has been treated previously for a sexually acquired infection and this may be why the culture is negative. Reactive arthritis can also result following a sexually acquired infection (usually Chlamydia trachomatis) and can result in mono or polyarthritis."
infectious diseases,224,A 16-year-old boy from India presents with fever of four months duration and splenomegaly. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Coccidioidomycosis,Giardiasis,Tropical sprue,Typhoid,Visceral leishmaniasis,E,"Visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) is an endemic disease in several regions of India and sub-Saharan Africa. It is caused by the parasite Leishmania donovani and spread by Phlebotomus sandflies. Leishmaniasis is common in immune-suppressed patients, particularly those infected with HIV. in 2011 there was a substantial increase of cases in the Mediterranean region. It has been estimated that 15% of HIV positive drug users in Spain are infected with Leishmania donovani infantum. Giardiasis and tropical sprue present with gastrointestinal symptoms and malabsorption. Typhoid is an acute illness. Coccidioidomycosis is largely confined to the Americas. Most patients present with pulmonary symptoms although disseminated disease can occur particularly in the immune-suppressed."
infectious diseases,225,A 33 year old gentleman who has recently immigrated from Brazil attends his GP. For some time he has noticed an enlarging white patch on his neck. On examination there is a large macular white lesion which is well demarcated on his neck which has reduced sensation and there is evidenced of a thickened auricular nerve. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Tuberculoid Leprosy,Lepromatous Leprosy,Diabetes Mellitus,Leishmaniasis,Vitiligo,A,"Leprosy is caused by an obligate intracellular bacillus Mycobacterium leprae. It is still prevalent in many coutries including India, Brazil and Africa. A hypopigmented area with reduced sensation, thickened peripheral nerve and evidence of acid fast bacilli pn biopsy provide the diagnosis. There is a spectrum of presentation from tuberculoid leprosy for those with an intact immune system to lepromatous leprosy for those who are immunocompromised and people can move up and down the spectrum. In tuberculoid leprosy there are very few lesions which are well demarcated with little to nil bacilli found on biopsy and the lesions tend to be macular. In lepromatous leprosy the lesions are many are ill defined and bacilli on biopsy are plentiful.  Vitiligo does not present with reduced sensation."
infectious diseases,226,"A 19 year old female presents with vaginal discharge. She has also noticed dysuria and post coital bleeding. On examination the cervix has a cobblestone appearance and there is contact bleeding. Given the most likely diagnosis, what treatment is most useful?",400mg Ofloxacin one week course,Single dose 1g azithromycin,200mg Doxycycline single dose,200mg Doxycycline one week course,Single dose IM 250mg ceftriaxone,B,"The most likely causative agent is chlamydia trachomatis. It can be asymptomatic however commonly causes the symptoms and findings on clinical examination observed here. Gonorrhoea can lead to vaginal discharge however typically examination is normal. Nucleic acid amplification tests are utilised for the diagnosis of both gonorrhoea and chlamydia as it has a high sensitivity and is non invasive as it can be performed on urine. A single dose of 1g azithromycin is indicated. Alternatives include a weeks course of doxycycline, ofloxacin, erythromycin and amoxicillin, however one dose azithromycin is the best for compliance."

Through inhibition of which of the following does aciclovir function?,Neuramidase,Polymerase,Protease,Reverse transcriptase,Intergrase inhibitors,B,Aciclovir is a synthetic purine nucleotide analogue and as such is a specific inhibitor of herpes virus DNA polymerase. Neuramidase inhibitors include oseltamavir Protease inhibitors include Ritonavir Reverse transciptase inhibitors include tenofovir Integrase inhibitors include Raltegravir
infectious diseases,228,Transplacental transmission of all of the following organisms is a recognised cause of fetal malformations and disease except which of the following?,Cytomegalovirus,Mumps,Rubella,Toxoplasma gondii,Varicella zoster virus,B,Cytomegalovirus in pregnancy can cause fetal abnormalities or abortion. Varicella is rare in pregnancy but can be severe and cause the intrauterine death of the fetus. Congenital toxoplasmosis usually results from an acute maternal infection during pregnancy. Measles and mumps cause only mild maternal infection and do not pose a serious problem to the fetus.
infectious diseases,229,Which of the following is true of Toxoplasma gondii?,Is a cause of congenital hydrocephalus,Is a Rickettsia,Is identified by Gram staining,Is transmitted by inspiring infected air droplets,Proliferates in the peripheral nerves,A,"Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of the Apicomplexa family. The life cycle of the T. gondii parasite has three stages:  Cyst Oocyst, and Tachyzoite.  The latter can proliferate in the central nervous systemforming cysts. This is particularly the case in the immunocompromised host, and infection is a serious problem in pregnancy, with fetal infection associated with:  stillbirth prematurity intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR), and neurological and ophthalmological abnormalities.  The organism is identified with the Giemsa stain. It is usually transmitted through faecal contamination (most often cats) but can be acquired through consuming uncooked meats (this is how the cats get the disease). "

Other less important features of severe pneumonia include:  Older age (greater than65) Comorbidity Confusion Cyanosis White blood cells less than4000 or greater than30000 Hypoxia, and Chest x ray with multilobe involvement."
infectious diseases,232,"A 32-year-old woman comes to the clinic. She complains of very foul smelling diarrhoea, abdominal bloating and excessive flatulence some two weeks after returning from a holiday to Mauritius with her husband. They admit to having eaten food from street vendors on a number of occasions during the course of the holiday. On examination her BP is 122/72 mmHg, there is no postural drop. Her pulse is 70 and regular. Respiratory examination is normal and abdominal examination reveals a soft but mildly distended abdomen, with active bowel sounds. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 118 g/L (115-165)   White cells 8.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 192 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (79-118)   Albumin 40 g/L (35-50)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Campylobacter,Giardiasis,Salmonella,Shigella,Tropical sprue,B,"This patient's history is consistent with Giardia lamblia infection, particularly with respect to her abdominal bloating, diarrhoea, and excess production of gas. It is transmitted via the faecal oral route, and she is likely to have picked up the infection from eating food from a street vendor. Diagnosis was traditionally based on stool microscopy looking for trophozoites or cysts, but antigen tests are now also available. The infection responds to treatment with either metronidazole or tinidazole, and once treated does not usually recur. Campylobacter usually has a shorter clinical course, with an incubation period which is typically 2 to 5 days. There is a prodromal illness of fever and myalgia which typically lasts for up to 24 hours. Predominant clinical symptoms are watery stool, which is often bloody and profuse (up to 10 stools per day). Pain is a predominant feature, and patients are often more unwell than described here. Salmonella has a much shorter clinical course than described here, with recovery usually seen within 4 to 7 days. Diarrhoea, which can be bloody, is often associated with fever and abdominal cramps. Shigella is also typically a more self-limited disease than described here, with symptoms having usually resolved within 3 to 7 days. Diarrhoea is watery, and may be accompanied by mucus, pus or blood. Tropical sprue is typically a more chronic condition than is described here. It consists of diarrhoea, malabsorption and weight loss. It classically occurs in residents of South East Asia and the Caribbean and affects visitors more rarely. It is presumed to have an infective cause, but this remains unclear. The clinical picture is variable. Patients are often deficient in iron, folate, vitamins B12, A, D, K and calcium. Jejunal biopsy shows incomplete villous atrophy."
infectious diseases,233,A 22 year old male has recently had unprotected sex and has notices the development of a firm lesion on his penis. He states it begin as a small bump which then ulcerated and the became a firm lesion. It is not painful. He has associated inguinal lymphadenopathy which is not painful. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Chancroid,Genital warts,Syphilis,Lymphogranuloma venereum,Herpes simplex virus,C,Multiple painful ulcers is typical of herpes simplex virus. In genital warts the lesions are not painful and the incubation period is very long. In syphilis there a papule which develops and the ulcerates but is painless and forms a firm chancre. The lymphadenopathy associated is also painless as described here. Lymphogranuloma venereum begins as a painless ulcerating papule then followed by painful lymphadenopathy with buboes formation. It is differentiated from syphilis by its appearance and painful lymphadenopathy and from herpes and Chancroid as these are both produce painful ulcerating lesions. Chancroid is caused by Haemophilus Ducreyi and begins as an erythematous papule which breaks down into an ulcer which are deep and often have a necrotic base and are painful. They ulcers are not shallow unlike herpes. Bubo formation can also occur.
infectious diseases,234,"A 25 year old male presents to his GP following a recent trip to Brazil. Whilst on holiday he remembers suffering from an itchy rash. Now he presents with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain, right upper quadrant discomfort and fatigue. On examination there is hepatosplenomegaly. What is the most likely causative agent?",Schistosoma intercalatum,Schistosoma mekongi,Schistosoma mansoni,Schistosoma japonicum,Schistosoma haematobium,C,"This is a typical presentation of gastrointestinal schistosomiasis. It is caused by a trematode/fluke infection of which the five options are the main ones. The intermediate host is a snail which releases cercariae in fresh water which can then attach to human by suckers to skin which can cause localised irritation, itch and urticaria. Once entering they migrate to the pulmonary capillaries they enter the systemic circulation and migrate to the portal veins where they mature and mate. S. haematobium is the only one that migrates to and enters the bladder, producing eggs and leading to the symptoms described here. Terminal haematuria is a particular symptom. The others enter the intestine. S haematologic is found in Africa and the middle east and s. masoni is found in Africa, Brazil, and other Latin American countries. S. intercalatum is found in rainforests around central Africa , s / japonicum in china and  s mekongi in Cambodia. It can present acutely with katayama fever (fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and rash), swimmers itch or chronically.  This can present with bloody diarrhoea, abdominal pain and portal or pulmonary hypertension. Diagnosis is via identification of eggs in urine or stool samples. Urine samples should ideally be taken between 10am and 2 pm as this is when urinary excretion of eggs is highest and the test is most likely to be positive. Eosinophilia can be present. Serology can also be useful. Praziquantel is the treatment of choice. Oxamniquine is an alternative."

Gonorrhoea,Human papillomavirus type 16 and 18,Human papillomavirus type 6 and 11,HIV,C,HPV type 16 and 18 are associated with cervical cancer whilst type 6 and 11  are associated with wart development and are not at high risk of neoplastic transformation.
infectious diseases,236,"A 35-year-old man is seen six months after a cadaveric renal allograft. He receives azathioprine and prednisolone. He has felt generally unwell for the past week with a pyrexia of 38.6°C, anorexia and a cough productive of thick green sputum. Chest x ray reveals a left lower lobe nodule of approximately 5 cm diameter with central cavitation. Analysis of the sputum reveals long, crooked, branching and beaded Gram positive filaments. Which of the following antimicrobials is the most appropriate initial therapy for this patient?",Ceftazidime,Co-amoxiclav,Co-trimoxazole,Erythromycin,Rifampicin and isoniazid,C,"The likely diagnosis is nocardiosis. Nocardia are aerobic, Gram positive branching filamentous bacteria which often appear beaded on staining. Nocardiosis can be diagnosed rapidly by examination of sputum or pus with the Gram stain and a modified acid-fast stain. Pneumonia is typically found in the immunocompromised, as in this case and may be a single lesion or extensive pneumonic consolidation. The drug of choice is trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole."
infectious diseases,237,Four members of a football team develop diarrhoea due to Salmonella enteritidis. Eating which food was the most likely source of the infection?,Chicken at a fast food outlet 20 hours earlier,Fried rice at a takeaway 4 hours earlier,Raw eggs in milk 6 hours earlier,Raw oysters at a hotel 24 hours earlier,Soft cheeses 48 hours earlier,A,The incubation time for Salmonella enteritidis is 12-48 hours and the likely sources are poultry and eggs. Raw oysters are associated with infections such as the Norwalk agent. Rice is associated with Bacillus Cerus infeciton.
infectious diseases,238,"A 40-year-old man presents with a long history of productive cough and breathlessness. He had complained of halitosis and exacerbations of productive sputum, chest pain and haemoptysis. Examination revealed bilateral inspiratory crackles. Which of the following treatments is likely to decrease the frequency of his exacerbations?",Cyclical antibiotic therapy,Inhaled corticosteroids,Nebulised bronchodilators,Postural drainage,Surgical resection,D,"This man has bronchiectasis as evidenced by his regular production of sputum associated with breathlessness, his repeated lung infections and the signs of bilateral inspiratory crackles. Retained mucus is the most important reason why bronchiectatic patients become infected. Postural drainage is, therefore, the cornerstone to treating bronchiectasis and should be undertaken at least once per day and more frequently during exacerbations. There have been trials looking at regular antibiotic therapy versus symptomatic treatment in patients with cystic fibrosis colonised with Pseudomonas (for example, Elborn JS et al. Thorax 2000;55: 355-358) but there is currently no evidence that this approach is of benefit in bronchiectasis. Similarly, inhaled corticosteroids should not be used routinely in bronchiectasis until further evidence of their effect on lung function and exacerbation frequency is available. Surgical resection as a curative procedure can be performed for localised disease when underlying causes such as primary ciliary dyskinesia have been excluded. In this patient, the bilateral crackles suggest widespread disease."
infectious diseases,239,A 30-year-old man presents to the emergency department with difficulty breathing. He has returned from India. Examinations: throat reveals grey membranes on the tonsils and uvula. He has mild pyrexia. What is the single most relevant diagnosis?,Diphtheria,IM,Acute follicular tonsillitis,Scarlet fever,Agranulocytosis,A,"Diphtheria is a serious infection caused by strains of bacteria called Corynebacterium diphtheriae that make toxin (poison). History of travel to india, grey membrane in tonsil and uvula, low grade fever, and dyspnoean suggests the diagnosis of diphtheria"
infectious diseases,240,A middle aged Asian presents with episodes of fever with rigors and chills for last 1 year. Blood film: ring form plasmodium with schuffner’s dots in RBCs. What is the drug to eradicate this infection?,Primaquine,Mefloquine,Proguanil,Quinine,Artesonate,A,"Shuffners dots inside RBC indicate, it is plasmodium ovale or plasmodium vivex infestation. Eradication of the disease needs eradication of liver cycle. Only primaquine is the drug that can eradicate hepatic or liver cycle"
infectious diseases,241,"A 19-year-old medical student presents at the Emergency Department with severe shortness of breath and a dry cough. He was diagnosed with chickenpox two days prior, with a sore throat and fever and an extensive vesicular rash affecting the face, trunk, arms and legs. On examination his temperature is 37.9°C, pulse is 86 and regular, O2 saturations on air are 90%. There is fine wheeze on auscultation of the chest and scattered crackles. Chest radiograph reveals small nodules throughout both lung fields and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. CRP is elevated at 85 mg/dl (less than10). He is commenced on O2 therapy. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?",Clarithromycin and co-amoxiclav,Flucloxacillin,IV aciclovir,Oral aciclovir,Varicella zoster immunoglobulin,C,"The answer is IV aciclovir. The chest x ray features and elevation in CRP are consistent with chickenpox pneumonia. As such, admission and treatment with IV aciclovir is indicated.  The role of corticosteroids in this situation is controversial, uncontrolled case series have suggested a potential benefit, but this has not been confirmed in randomised controlled trials. Clarithromycin and co-amoxiclav are the standard therapy for community-acquired pneumonia, but the picture seen here doesn't really fit with that, particularly the diffuse nodular changes on CXR. Flucloxacillin is of value in the treatment of post viral bacterial pneumonia which may be due to Staphylococcal infection. Oral aciclovir and varicella zoster Ig are less effective in this situation versus IV aciclovir."
infectious diseases,242,A 15-year-old female is a close contact of a student who has developed meningitis C. The last contact she had with her friend was two days ago when her friend developed a headache. She has not received any previous vaccination for meningitis. What is the most appropriate action for this girl?,No treatment is required and the girl can be reassured,She should receive the meningococcal C vaccination only,She should receive the meningococcal C vaccination plus ciprofloxacin,She should receive meningococcal immunoglobulin only,Treat with rifampicin only,C,"This girl runs a reasonably high risk of developing meningitis and should receive meningitis C vaccination together with chemoprophlaxis. UK Public Health guidance (referenced below) now recommends ciprofloxacin as first-line chemoprophylaxis in all age groups and in pregnancy. This has replaced rifampicin, as it can be given as a single dose, does not interact with oral contraceptives and is more readily available in community pharmacies. The risk of arthropathy in children (which is why it is not usually given to children) has been found to be very low, with only transient arthralgia which was considered to be coincidental in most cases.  Close contacts of those with confirmed serogroup C meningococcal disease who were only immunised in infancy or who have completed the immunisation course more than one year before should be offered an extra dose of the Meningitis C conjugate vaccine. The quadrivalent conjugate vaccine is reserved for contacts of cases of confirmed serogroup A, W135 or Y infection (or probable cases where these organisms are found on nasopharyngeal swab).  "
infectious diseases,243,"A 25-year-old female recently returned from Nigeria, presents to the Emergency Department with a two-day history of fever and rigors. Subsequently she develops a seizure. What is the next most appropriate investigationto yield a diagnosis?",Blood culture,Blood film for malarial parasites,CT scan of head,Lumbar puncture,MR scan of head,B,"With a recent history of travel to Nigeria, cerebral malaria caused by P. falciparum should be considered as a likely cause of her symptoms. Therefore, a malaria blood film should be performed. Other investigations may be required but investigations for malaria should be performed immediately. Blood culture will not aid in the diagnosis. Cross sectional imaging of the head would likely be done in A and E following a seizure but would not yield a diagnosis.  The same can be said for CSF analysis via LP."
infectious diseases,244,"A HIV +ve 55-year-old man presents with painless lymphadenopathy, fever, night sweats and weight loss. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Hodgkin’s lymphoma,NHL,ALL,AML,CML,B,NHL is more likely diagnosis in AIDS or immunodeficient state

Which of the following would be indicated in the treatment?,Atovaquone,Clindamycin,Leucovorin,Pentamidine,Trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole,E,"This patient has severe PCP as suggested by the hypoxia (PO2 less than 70). He should be treated with high percentage oxygen and the drug of choice is high dose IV co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole). If allergic to co-trimoxazole, IV pentamidine or clindamycin are appropriate. IV leucovorin and oral atovaquone are further options but are not first line therapies. Prednisolone has been shown to reduce mortality substantially in patients with a PO2 less than60 mmHg."
infectious diseases,247,A 76-year-old woman has become tired and confused following an influenza like illness. She is also breathless with signs of consolidation of the left lung base. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Drug toxicity,Delirium tremens,Infection toxicity,Hypoglycemia,Electrolyte imbalance,C,Infection toxicity or toxic shock syndrome is likely here as preceding flue like illness points towards current staphylococcal pneumonia which resulted release of enterotoxin type B leading to infection toxicity
infectious diseases,248,When should patients who are having a splenectomy be given the pneumococcal vaccination?,1 week before surgery,2 weeks following surgery,2 weeks before surgery,1 week following surgery,3 days before surgery,C,The pnuemococcal vaccination should be given 2 weeks before surgery.

The lumbar puncture findings of predominant polymorphs, low glucose and elevated protein are in keeping with a bacterial meningitis."
infectious diseases,251,"An 18-year-old male presents to the general medical take. He presents with large grey lesions around his perineum and in his mouth which started 2 days ago. He reports that he has a more general rash on his trunk and the palms and soles of his feet. He generally feels unwell with malaise and fever. He has never had anything like this before, but mentions that he did see a small ulcer on his scrotum a month ago that didn't hurt and healed on its own. He reports that he is generally fit and well and has just moved to the area to start his university studies. On examination he has a symmetrical, widespread, macular popular rash on his trunk, limbs and the palms and soles of his feet. This is different from the large greyish lesions that you see in his mouth and perineum. His has general lymphadenopathy that is minimally tender on palpation. His chest is clear on auscultation, there are no added heart sounds and his abdomen is soft and non-tender. Investigations show: Haemoglobin 13g/dl, WCC 11 x 10^9/l ,Platelets 352 x 10^9/l, CRP 89 Sodium 145 mmol/l Potassium 3.8 mmol/l, Urea 4 mmol/l, Creatinine 82 mol/l What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cytomegalovirus,Epstine Barr Virus,Herpes Simplex Virus,HIV,Treponema pallidum,E,"This young man presents with a symmetrical rash on his trunk, palms, and soles that is pathognomonic for secondary syphilis. He also has a further rash of grey lesion in the mouth and perineum associated with syphilis. Although he was not concerned about it, he has also mentioned that he had a painless genital ulcer one month ago that may have represented his primary syphilis infection. He has general lymphadenopathy and epitrochlear nodes are particularly suggestive of the diagnosis. He is a young man that has recently started university and is likely to be enjoying this period of parties and new acquaintances. It would be worth exploring his sexual history further as syphilis is more common in men who have sex with men. Patients are often co-infected with other sexually transmitted diseases and this patient should be further investigated for these. "

It is leading you to consider a diagnosis of HIV in this gentleman, and subsequent opportunistic infections. His clinical presentation fits best with a diagnosis of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Pneumocystis jiroveci is a eukaryotic microorganism. In immunosuppressed patients, it can cause pneumonia, which is most recognised in patients with AIDS but can also be seen in those with organ transplants or when undergoing chemotherapy. A CD4 count of less than 200 is associated with significant risk. In Europe, the USA and Australia P. jiroveci pneumonia in HIV-positive patients is seen largely in those unaware of their HIV status. Unfortunately, it is a major cause of death in Africa, especially in children. Previously it was thought that disease was caused by reactivation of latent infection acquired in childhood, but de novo infection is increasingly recognised. Pneumonia caused by P. jiroveci is potentially severe and fatal in immunosuppressed patients. Clinically it presents with several weeks' history of dry cough, fever and dyspnoea. Examination findings are often subtle but include tachypnoea, tachycardia, cyanosis and fine respiratory crackles. Typically, patients desaturate markedly on exertion. There may be reduced transfer factor, vital capacity and total lung capacity on spirometry. Bronchoalveolar lavage or induced sputum can be used to demonstrate the organism (open lung biopsy is the gold standard, but rarely performed in clinical practice). Giemsa, Papanicolaou and Grocott's stains are used. There are a variety of different chest radiograph findings. Typically it causes bilateral symmetrical perihilar reticular or granular interstitial shadowing. Less often there can be asymmetric shadowing or progression to a reticular-alveolar pattern. Occasionally lobar consolidation, nodular lesions, prominent pulmonary arteries, pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, cysts or pneumatoceles can be seen. In patients who have been on prophylactic inhaled pentamidine, the infiltrates may predominantly affect the upper lobes. A normal chest x ray does not exclude the diagnosis. Pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy are not typical, but be aware of the possibility of multiple disease processes in an immunosuppressed patient. If allowed to progress, P. jiroveci can disseminate via the lymphatic and haematogenous routes to affect the thyroid, liver, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. If PCP is suspected, treatment with full dose co-trimoxazole should be started as soon as possible. It should be given for 21 days in HIV-positive cases, but shorter doses can be used in other causes of immunosuppression. In patients who are intolerant or co-trimoxazole, intravenous pentamidine can be used. Some studies have shown that corticosteroids can reduce the risk of respiratory failure, and they are therefore used in some cases. Prophylaxis should be used in immunosuppressed patients who are at risk of developing PCP: all those with a CD4 count of less than200, patients started on high dose steroids, and those on chemotherapeutic regimens associated with significant immunosuppression. Co-trimoxazole is also the first line prophylactic agent. Tuberculosis is another possible diagnosis, but would likely be miliary given the lymphadenopathy and respiratory symptoms. This usually presents with a more insidious onset, and the radiographic findings generally take a few weeks to develop. The incidence is dependent on the patient's exposure to TB, and it is, therefore, more common in patients who originate from areas of high prevalence. Tricuspid endocarditis is definitely a possibility in an intravenous drug user presenting with these symptoms. Bilateral areas of pulmonary shadowing are possible due to septic emboli, but you may expect the question to report a murmur heart on auscultation. Pneumococcal pneumonia typically has a shorter history than this, and bilateral disease is unusual. Alcoholic cardiomyopathy presents with signs and symptoms of congestive cardiac failure, not those described here. "

infectious diseases,265,"A 55-year-old Caucasian man presented to hospital with fever, intermittent rigours, and worsening fatigue. He had returned from a business trip to West Africa six months previously. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Brucellosis,Leishmaniasis,Plasmodium falciparum malaria,Plasmodium ovale malaria,Typhoid fever,D,"The Duffy blood group on the red blood cells acts as a receptor for P. vivax. West Africans lack the Duffy blood group and therefore P. ovale replaces P. vivax in this region. Both P. vivax and P. ovale have a liver hypnozoite stage which can cause repeated relapses. P. falciparum typically presents within the first three months of return. Visceral leishmaniasis is not endemic in West Africa. Brucellosis is a zoonosis transmitted through contaminated and untreated milk and by direct contact with infected animals. The incubation period of brucellosis is usually one to three weeks, but sometimes may be several months. It may have either a sudden or insidious onset and is accompanied by continued, intermittent, or irregular fever. Typhoid fever presents within one to three weeks from return from an endemic area."

infectious diseases,268,"A 28-year-old shop worker is referred with a three-month history of recurrent episodes of disorientation and confusion. Her boyfriend has found her wandering around the house on several occasions, apparently with no idea of where she is or how she got there. Her mood has been very low, with frequent emotional outbursts, and she has considered leaving her job because of problems with working the computer and managing customers' queries. Her boyfriend feels her condition is significantly worsening. Physical examination is normal, apart from recurrent, asymmetrical, jerks in all four limbs. Which of the following investigations is likely to be most useful in reaching a diagnosis?",Chest x ray,CT head,EEG,Liver function tests,Visual evoked potentials,C,"This kind of rapid cognitive decline in a young person with myoclonus is strongly suggestive of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). A definitive diagnosis of any form of CJD requires pathological examination of brain tissue, which is usually only done post-mortem. During life, investigations are undertaken for two reasons: to exclude other possible diagnoses, and to support the diagnosis of CJD. Supportive investigations are EEG, CSF examination and MRI. The EEG in sporadic CJD may show significant abnormalities involving deep brain areas such as the thalami. The normal rhythms are gradually lost. Initially, the changes are diffuse, and non-specific, developing into generalised bi- or triphasic periodic sharp wave complexes with a frequency of 1-2 per second. High voltage sharp waves may be synchronous with myoclonic jerks. In an appropriate clinical context, this EEG pattern is strongly suggestive of a diagnosis of CJD. Neither CSF examination nor MRI is options here, but both can also give supportive information. The CSF typically contains no inflammatory cells, but the total protein content may be raised. Analysis for brain-specific proteins, particularly 14-3-3, is supportive in the right clinical context. In a proportion of cases, abnormalities of the signal in the anterior basal ganglia (caudate/putamen, and sometimes the cortex) can be seen on MRI, which can also support the diagnosis. Chest x ray and liver function tests may help to exclude other diagnoses, but do not give supportive information for CJD. Visual evoked potentials may be altered in CJD, but no specific pattern has yet been identified to support the diagnosis. CT head generally demonstrates brain atrophy in CJD, but this is not a specific finding and is, therefore, less useful than an EEG."
infectious diseases,269,"In HIV, which of the following is true?",Aspergillus is the most common cause of fungal brain disease,Co-trimoxazole is the treatment of choice for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP),Opportunistic infections normally occur with a CD4 count greater than200 cells/mm^3,Antiretrovirals are contraindicated in patients with a CD4+ count of less than500,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia usually has no radiographical changes on plain x ray,B,Cryptococcal meningitis is the most common cause of fungal brain disease. Co-trimoxazole is the treatment of choice for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). It is also used as a prophylaxis agent in HIV patients at risk from PCP. Opportunistic infections normally occur with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm^3. Current guidelines recommend starting antiretrovirals regardless of CD4 count.

She is thought to have a tampon retained. She is transferred to ITU as she is found to be in Acute renal, liver and respiratory failure. 10 days after the onset there was desquamation of the palms and soles. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Meningococcal septicaemia,Infectious mononucleosis,Toxic Shock syndrome,Kawasaki disease,Scarlet fever,C,"This presentation is highly suggestive of toxic shock syndrome. The desquamation is a clue and retained tampon is a known risk factor. Multi organ failure is another component of toxic shock syndrome. Toxic shock syndrome is thought to be caused by staphylococcal aureus or streptococcus pyogenes. There is production of exotoxins which are thought to act as superantigens (do not require processing by antigen presenting cells), leading to massive activation of T cells and cytokine production. Beta lactams and clindamycin are useful in the management. Vancomycin may be required for staphylococcal infection where there is a penicillin allergy."
infectious diseases,272,Which of the following is a feature of vancomycin-resistant enterococci?,Are commonly vancomycin-dependent,Cause resistant infective diarrhoea,High dose ampicillin is the treatment of choice,May be found in healthy community volunteers not recently hospitalised,Produce an enzyme that inactivates vancomycin,D,"Only some strains are vancomycin-dependent. An explanation for this curious process is that there is an inability to produce cell walls because the vancomycin-sensitive precursor genes have been turned off and the resistant ones only appear in the presence of vancomycin. When they cause clinical problems they are usually urinary tract infections (UTI), bacteraemia, wound infections, neonatal infections, endocarditis, etc. rather than resistant infective diarrhoea. Ampicillin is the treatment of choice only if the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) of ampicillin is not too high. Anecdotal evidence exists for its use in E. faecalis endocarditis. (20 g/day). Vancomycin-resistant enterococci may be found in healthy community volunteers not recently hospitalised. Two percent in the United Kingdom general practice, 28% in Belgium. Community reservoir in meat, poultry and perhaps cheese. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci alter peptidoglycan precursors used to build cell walls. Vancomycin binds to D-ala-D-ala but the resistant enterococci have D-ala-D-lac or D-ala terminating precursors. They acquire genes that produce enzymes to change the precursors. "

What is the most appropriate choice of antibiotics?",Amoxicillin,Amoxicillin plus erythromycin,Ceftriaxone,Ciprofloxacin,Co-amoxiclav,A,"This gentleman has community-acquired pneumonia. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is defined as symptoms and signs consistent with an acute lower respiratory tract infection associated with new radiological signs consistent with consolidation, not explained by another cause. The severity of each case of CAP should be assessed using the CURB-65 tool in conjunction with clinical judgment. Patients score 1 point for each of:  confusion urea greater than7 mmol/L respiratory rate ≥30/min blood pressure: systolic less than90 or diastolic ≤60 mmHg, and age ≥65 years.  A CURB-65 score of 0 or 1 (as in this case) are at low risk of death and can be treated at home if the social circumstances are compatible. A score of 2 usually indicates inpatient treatment is required, but hospital-supervised outpatient treatment can be considered. Patients who have a CURB-65 score of 3 or more are at high risk of death. Those with scores of 4 and 5 should be considered for treatment in a critical care unit (HMU, ITU). In the majority of patients CAP should be confirmed by chest radiography before the commencement of antibiotics. However, if patients are critically unwell they should be treated for the presumptive diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment should be initiated within four hours of presentation.  Low severity CAP (CURB 0-1) can be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg TDS PO. CURB 2 CAP should be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg-1g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. Alternatives are available if patients are allergic to any of the above combinations. High severity CAP (CURB 3-5) should be treated as soon as possible with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD.  The oral route is recommended in those with low and moderate severity CAP. Patients treated with parenteral antibiotics initially should be switched to an oral regimen once clinical improvement is seen and the patient has been afebrile for at least 24 hours. For most patients with uncomplicated CAP seven days of antibiotic treatment is recommended. For those with high severity pneumonia where an organism has not been identified, 7-10 days treatment is indicated and extended to 14-21 days where clinically needed. "

He had a Tuna fish steak, which tasted bitter and peppery, and about 20 minutes after consuming this he felt flushed, nauseous, and anxious with a headache and palpitations. He felt a tingling sensation around his mouth and developed a diffuse, macular, blanching rash over his upper chest and neck. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Scromboid food poisoning,S. Aureus toxin food poisoning,Toxic Shock syndrome,Angioedema,Anaphylaxis,A,"This is a classical description of scromboid food poisoning. It is thought to be due to biogenic amines including histamine. Bacterial decarboxylation of histidine produces histamine and this is present in large quantities in the responsible fish. It was initially recognised in Scombroidea fish such as tuna and mackerel. The histidine decarboxylation is thought to occur when fish have been inadequately cooled or in spoiled fish. Due to the high levels of histamine, the sysmptoms are similar to that of an allergy as described in the question."

infectious diseases,280,"Regarding pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila, which of the following is true?",Is associated with hyponatraemia,Is best treated with intravenous amoxicillin and clavulanic acid,Is common in AIDS patients,Is readily diagnosed by standard aerobic culture of sputum,Should be managed on the ward in a respiratory isolation cubicle,A,"Legionella pneumophila is a Gram negative bacillus that is ubiquitous in the environment. Human infection occurs when a sufficient inoculum of bacteria are aerosolised and inhaled. It usually affects middle-aged and elderly patients, often with underlying lung disease. It is more common in men (3:1). A variety of environmental sources have been identified as reservoirs of Legionella and have been responsible for infection in humans, including air conditioners, humidifiers, shower units and hot tubs. Other factors that predispose to infection include smoking, alcoholism, old age, chronic illness and immunosuppression. It is not common in AIDS, but in severe disease, there is an increased risk. The infection causes a flu-like illness with a dry cough, headache, confusion and delirium. Gastrointestinal upset is common, with diarrhoea and ileus. Focal neurological signs can develop. Bloods often show a normal white cell count with lymphopenia (with or without thrombocytopenia, or pancytopenia). Sodium is often low, due to a syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone. 50% of patients have abnormal renal and liver function, and acute kidney injury can develop. Creatinine kinase can be raised. Legionellae do not grow on standard culture media, but require specific supplemented media; they grow best at a low pH. Diagnosis is most commonly with antigen testing in the urine, but direct fluorescent antibody staining or serology can be used. Erythromycin or clarithromycin are the antibiotics of choice; alternatives include doxycycline, cotrimoxazole or ciprofloxacin. "

Which of the following antibiotics should be started?,Ciprofloxacin,Co-amoxiclav,Doxycycline,Metronidazole,Penicillin,C,"The diagnosis is non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) or non-specific urethritis (NSU). A presumptive diagnosis of gonococcal urethritis is made if Gram-negative diplococci are seen within the neutrophils. Doxycycline is the drug of choice for NGU. Alternative therapies include erythromycin, azithromycin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Chlamydia trachomatis is the commonest cause of NGU accounting for 30-50% of cases. All sexual partners at risk should be assessed and offered epidemiological treatment. "

He is commenced on IV gentamicin and tazocin however 2 days later he is still unwell and pyrexial. Which of the following should you then consider commencing?,Add IV meropenem,IV fluconazole,Nil,Amphotericin B,Add IV vancomycin,D,"Patients with AML are at greater risk of the development of a systmic fungal infection. This may be due to neutropenia secondary to chemotherapy and/or immunosuppression. In patients who are immunosuppressed and/or being treated for neutropenic sepsis, who remain pyrexial despite multiple antibiotics, then other organisms should be considered such as viral or invasive fungal infections such as candidiasis or aspergillosis. Therefore in this case amphotericin B should be considered empirically as it is effective against both of these organisms."

Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 114 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 11.2 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Raised eosinophils -   Platelets 180 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Extrinsic allergic alveolitis.,Extrinsic allergic asthma,Hydatid disease,Schistosomiasis,Weil's disease,D,"The initial area of itching may be related to swimmers' itch, which is related to the entry of the parasite through the skin after swimming in an area where the parasite is present in water. The raised eosinophil count supports the diagnosis, and the dry cough raises the possibility of parasitic migration to the lungs. Diagnosis is based upon the presence of parasites in the stool, or in the urine in the case of S. haematobium. Praziquantel is the treatment of choice, given as a single dose with follow-up in four to six weeks."
infectious diseases,285,"A 27-year-old female presents to the medical take. She has been unable to get an appointment at her GP and is concerned as she has noticed frank haematuria for the last 8 days. She has no dysuria or frequency. She reports she has noticed four episodes of haematuria previously, but these have always resolved spontaneously after a day or two. She reports she is usually fit and well apart from hearing aids that she has needed since birth. This doesn't seem unusual to her as both her younger sister also has needed hearing aids since birth. She works as a primary school teacher and lives with her mother and her sister. Her parents divorced when she was 7 and she has not had any contact with her father since. On examination, she has an abdomen that is soft and non-tender. Her Rinne test was positive and her Weber test was equally heard in both ears. Investigations show: Haemoglobin 127g/l, WCC 6 x 10^9/l ,Platelets 376 x 10^9/l Sodium 139 mmol/l Potassium 5.2 mmol/l, Urea 13 mmol/l, Creatinine 292 mmol/l Urine dip - blood +++, protein +++, leucocytes negative, nitrites negative What is the most likely diagnosis?",Alport's Syndrome,Goodpasture Syndrome,IgA nephropathy,Minimal change disease,Rapidly-progressive glomerulonephritis,A,"This young woman has recurrent painless haematuria, deteriorated renal function and a sensorineural deafness as demonstrated by the Rinne and Weber test. She also has a family history of sensorineural deafness. Since she has not seen her father for many years she may discover that he too has renal failure and hearing problems. It would be important to investigate her sister's renal function. Alport's syndrome is a genetic disorder leading to mutations on collagen type 4. This type of collagen is found in the basement membrane of the kidney, the eye and the cochlear leading the renal, hearing and eye problems. It is commonly X-linked, but may be seen in a less severe, lyonisation pattern in affected females. It can also present in a dominant or recessive fashion. Diagnosis is made on tissue biopsy and genetic testing. "
infectious diseases,286,"A 22 year old male has recently had unprotected sex and has notices the development of a firm lesion on his penis. He states it begin as a small bump which then ulcerated and the became a firm lesion. It is not painful. He has associated inguinal lymphadenopathy which is not painful. You suspect syphilis however his EIA, FTA abs, TPHA and VDRL are negative. Which other test if positive will confirm early primary syphilis?",Positive dark ground microscopy,Repeat VDRL in a few weeks,CSF sample,Negative dark ground microscopy,Blood cultures,A,"In early primary syphilis, antibodies can be negative. The t. pallidum EIA (enzyme immunoassay) or haemagglutination (TPHA) and fluorescent treponemal antibodies (FTA abs) are highly specific but ,may take some time to rise. VDRL are non specific but can be quantified and thus are useful in monitoring disease activity and response to treatment. If it is early in the disease then positive dark ground microscopy can be utilised to confirm the diagnosis and allow treatment to commence as antibodies may not raise for several weeks."
infectious diseases,287,"A 27-year-old man comes to the Emergency Department with his partner at 5 am. He has developed torrential diarrhoea a few hours after eating a Chinese takeaway with fried rice. Apparently, he bought the meal at the beginning of the evening when he thought it would be most fresh. On examination he is dehydrated with a BP of 110/70 mmHg, a pulse of 90 and a significant postural drop. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 150 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 6.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 292 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 142 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 122 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely cause of his gastroenteritis?",Bacillus cereus,Norovirus,Rotavirus,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus typhi,A,"Bacillus cereus food poisoning occurs around six to eight hours after ingestion of reheated rice. Two distinct forms occur, one related to a toxin which leads to profuse vomiting, the other which leads to torrential diarrhoea. It is likely the takeaway restaurant reheated rice that was left over from the previous evening. The condition is self-limiting and usually resolves within 24 hours. No specific intervention is required, and this patient should just be given oral rehydration salts. Norovirus usually occur from infected meat or fish products. Rotavirus is usually spread through the faecal-oral route."
infectious diseases,288,A 56-year-old man with known HIV presents with chronic diarrhea. What is the most likely cause?,Cryptococcus infection,Toxoplasmosis,Pneumocystis carinii,Cryptosporidium,Herpes zoster,D,In AIDS patients common cause of diarrhea is cryptosporidium
infectious diseases,289,"What is the most common organism to lead to watery diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal cramps in a patient with HIV?",Giardia,Shigella,Microsporidia,Cryptosporidium,Salmonella,D,In HIV cryptosporidium is a common cause of watery diarrhoea and is an AIDS defining illness. Salmonella and shigella typically lead to a bloody diarrhoea.
infectious diseases,290,Which of the following statements regarding Japanese encephalitis is most true?,Is endemic in East Africa,It is a DNA virus,It is only recognised in travellers who have spent prolonged periods in endemic areas,Previous exposure to a flavivirus predisposes to increased risk of death on infection with Japanese encephalitis,Transplacental transmission occurs,E,"Japanese encephalitis is an RNA virus which is endemic in India, East Asia, Malaysia and the Philippines. Previous infection by a pathogen which is a member of the Flavivirus family seems to protect against serious disease or death when infection occurs with another member of the Flavivirus family. For instance previous exposure to dengue lowers the risk of death when infected by Japanese encephalitis. Infection with Japanese encephalitis has been reported in travellers who have spent only short periods in endemic areas, and transplacental transmission can occur. An immunisation is available for travellers.   "
infectious diseases,291,"A 29-year-old man from Southampton with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (CD4 cell count 150 cells/mm^3) is admitted to hospital with a 10-day history of fever (temperature 38.8°C), a dry cough, weight loss and night sweats. There is a history of previous tuberculosis. His current medications include TDF/3TC/EFV and inhaled pentamidine. Physical examination reveals crackles in the upper lung fields. Chest radiography reveals bilateral upper lobe infiltrates. Initial results of his induced sputum examination demonstrate no organisms seen on Gram, fungal, acid-fast and Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia staining. Which regimen would be most effective against the likely cause of this man's symptoms?",Clarithromycin and Amoxil,Ganciclovir,"Isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide",Itraconazole,Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole,E,"The clinical presentation of the said patient is compatible with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP). Inhaled pentamidine is not as effective as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in preventing PCP. Focal lobe infiltrates are more common in patients who have been receiving aerosol pentamidine prophylaxis. The sensitivity of induced sputum for PCP might be decreased in patients receiving pentamidine prophylaxis. This patient requires bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage for diagnosis; trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is the treatment of choice unless the patient is allergic. Isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide are used in the treatment of tuberculosis. TB would definitely be on the list of differentials. However, the radiological finding of upper lobe infiltrates is more commonly seen with PCP (especially those who have been on inhaled pentamadine prophylaxis). Itraconazole is the wrong answer. Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia is officially classified as fungal pneumonia, but lacks ergosterol and is not susceptible to antifungal drugs that inhibit ergosterol synthesis. Ganciclovir is the treatment of choice for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. CMV is a differential diagnosis for PCP. It also presents with fevers, dyspnoea, and cough as the symptoms. However, it is very uncommon in patients who are HIV positive (the reason for this is not fully understood) meaning PCP is the more likely diagnosis here. Clarithromycin and Amoxil are the empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonias caused by bacteria."
infectious diseases,292,Which of the following does not lead to chronic liver disease?,Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency,Cystic fibrosis,Haemochromatosis,Haemosiderosis,Hepatitis C,D,"Sixty per cent to 80% of patients with hepatitis C develop chronic hepatitis and 20% of these will progress to cirrhosis.  Liver disease from chronic cholestasis occurs in cystic fibrosis. Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency causes both cirrhosis and emphysema. Haemochromatosis is autosomal recessive and is characterised by excessive iron deposition in various organs causing organ failure (diabetes, heart failure, chronic liver disease, hypogonadism, skin pigmentation and arthritis). Haemosiderosis usually arises due to parenteral iron overload, for example, in patients with aplastic anaemia after multiple transfusions. It is not commonly associated with cirrhosis. If cirrhosis does develop as a result of massive iron overload the condition is known as secondary haemochromatosis."

What is the single most appropriate option?,Mycobacterium avium,CMV (cytomegalo virus),Hemophilus influenze,NHL (non hodgkin’s lymphoma),Pneumocysticjerovici,B,Weight loss in a homosexual is likely to be due to AIDS and CMV retinopathy with retinal hemorrhage is a recognized association
infectious diseases,294,A patient is being treated with IV vancomycin and gentamicin for prosthetic valve infective endocarditis. He is not improving and MRSA is suspected. Which of the following is a reasonable addition to the current management?,Ciprofloxacin,Flucloxacillin,Doxycycline,Rifampicin,Fluconazole,D,For a patient with suspected MRSA infective endocarditis an appropriate antibiotic regime is vancomycin plus gentamicin plus rifampicin.
infectious diseases,295,"A 50-year-old man presented to hospital feeling generally unwell for three days. He had returned from a business trip to Thailand six weeks previously and had taken mefloquine as prophylaxis against malaria. On examination he was afebrile, temperature 36.5°C, pulse was 100/minute and regular, his BP was 85/60 mm Hg. Investigations showed:    Hb 142 g/L (130-180)   WBC 19.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 18.0 ×10^9/L (1.5-7.0)   AST 72 U/L (1-31)   Alkaline phosphatase 255 U/L (45-105)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute HIV infection (seroconversion illness),Dengue fever,Gram negative bacteraemia,Hepatitis B,Mefloquine-induced hepatitis,C,"This is a difficult question. The neutrophilia essentially excludes most viral causes. The presentation is not typical of acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (fever, pharyngitis, rash and lymphadenopathy). Mefloquine can cause abnormal liver function tests but is not common. Even though the patient is afebrile, the likeliest diagnosis is, therefore, Gram negative bacteraemia."
infectious diseases,296,A 22-year-old female student attended the Emergency Department complaining of fever and rigours for two days. She had returned from a sabbatical in Africa six weeks previously. She was febrile (39.9°C) and a mild petechial rash was also noted. Laboratory investigations showed:    Haemoglobin 101 g/L (115-165)   WBC 3.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 115 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Prothrombin time Normal -    What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acute HIV infection (seroconversion illness),Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection,Dengue fever,Plasmodium falciparum malaria,Typhoid fever,A,"A difficult question that partly hinges on the incubation times of these illnesses. The incubation time is too long for dengue, typhoid and falciparum malaria. The presentation is not typical of CMV. Acute human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) presents two weeks to three months after exposure to the virus; the illness typically consists of:  fever arthritis rash, and lymphadenopathy.  The presentation given here is not characteristic of acute HIV, but is the most reasonable of the options listed."

cardiovascular system,1,"A 43-year-old woman presents to the Emergency Department with diarrhoea and vomiting over the past 48 hours. She has a history of hypertension for which she takes indapamide 1.5 mg daily, but no other past medical history of note. On examination she looks unwell and has a BP of 122/71 mmHg and a pulse of 79. Her abdomen is soft but there is tenderness consistent with her gastroenteritis. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 148 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 9.8 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 174 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 2.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 139 μmol/L (60-120)    Which of the following is most likely to be found on her ECG?",Atrial fibrillation,J waves,Peaked T waves,Shortening of the QT interval,ST depression,E,"When potassium falls below 3 mmol/l, the ECG often demonstrates:  Flattening of the T waves ST depression QT prolongation, and Prominent U waves.  Patients are at increased risk of ventricular ectopics, torsades de pointes, and ventricular tachycardia. Other constitutional symptoms associated with hypokalaemia of less than 3.0 mmol/L include:  Tiredness General weakness Muscle pain, and Constipation."
cardiovascular system,2,"A 19 year old patient presents with palpitations and light headedness.  She was previously commenced on a beta blocker for this as an ECG revealed a short PR interval and Q waves in lead II, III and aVF.  In the long term, what is the most appropriate management?",Increased does of beta blocker,Amiodarone,Verapamil,Digoxin,Radio frequency ablation,E,This patient most likely has Long Ganong Levine syndrome given the short PR interval.  It is an AVRT and it differs from Wolff Parkinson White as there is an absence of a delta wave.  Patients may develop SVT as in this case.  Long term management is radio frequency ablation as both these syndromes are caused by an accessory pathway between the atria and ventricles. Digoxin should be avoided as it can result in an increased ventricular rate.  Amiodarone long term has significant side effects such as pulmonary fibrosis and given the age of this patient this should be avoided.  Beta blockers are useful in the short term.
cardiovascular system,3,"In angina, which of the following accounts for some of the therapeutic effect of beta blockers?",Peripheral vasoconstriction,Decreased heart rate,Coronary artery vasodilatation,Increased heart rate,Peripheral vasodilatation,B,Beta blockers inhibit the beta1 receptor which results in reduced heart rate and myocardial contractility. This results in improved oxygen supply and demand balance and therefore improved symptoms of angina and account for their therapeutic effect.
cardiovascular system,4,"A 50 year old man was admitted with central crushing chest pain. He is a smoker and is on ramipril fro hypertension which has not been well controlled. He is found to have ST depression in leads I, II, aVL, V4 V6 and his 12 hour troponin was 1.0. He underwent angiography and stent insertion. Three days later he is complaining of the same crushing central chest pain. A repeat ECG showed the same ST depression. Which enzyme should be measured to assess if there is further damage to the myocardium?",CKMB,LDH,Troponin T,Troponin I,AST,A,In this example CKMB would be useful if there has been a baseline value as it increase shortly after onset of chest pain and an increase again would indicate a new event as the levels decrease quickly. Troponin is not indicative as it does not reach its peak until 24-48 hours after onset of chest pain and remains elevated for up to 2 weeks following chest pain. LDH has a later peak at 3-6 days.
cardiovascular system,5,Which of the following pulse characters is most typical of left ventricular failure?,Pulsus alternans,Pulsus paradoxus,Small volume pulse,Collapsing pulse,Jerky pulse,A,"Pulsus alternans is alternating strong and weak beats and is typically found in LVF. It may also be found in cardiomyopathy and aortic stenosis. Pulsus paradoxus is whereby systolic pressure weakens by over 10mmHg during inspiration, therefore the pulse becomes weak and can be detected on auscultation but not by palpation at the radial pulse. It is found in severe asthma, pericardial constriction or cardiac tamponade."
cardiovascular system,6,"A 65-year-old man is admitted with central crushing chest pain, sweating, and vomiting of one hour duration. He is conscious with a pulse rate of 100 bpm and a blood pressure of 180/110 mmHg. An ECG shows greater than2 mm ST elevation in leads II, III, aVF. FBC and Uandamp;Es are normal. Troponin T is 100 ng/ml. Apart from the presence of xanthelasma (+) there are no other positive findings on clinical examination. He is given oxygen, aspirin, clopidogrel, morphine, and intravenous 5 mg atenolol. Which of the following is the best next step? ",Give thrombolysis immediately,Immediate referral to cardiologist for primary angioplasty,Prescribe low molecular weight heparin,Prescribe simvastatin,Transfer to coronary care unit for closer monitoring,B,"This is a case of acute inferior ST elevation myocardial infarction (MI), so the next appropriate management in this case is urgent referral for primary angioplasty. Early revascularisation for ST elevation MI improves prognosis and outcome. Thrombolysis is less successful than primary angioplasty at restoring flow and has higher bleeding complications. Monitoring on CCU is appropriate after revascularisation. Low molecular weight has no benefit in ST elevation MI. Statin therapy is not required immediately."
cardiovascular system,7,"A 72-year-old man comes to the surgery with his wife. She has witnessed two seizures at home, both of which have lasted for no longer than two minutes or so, accompanied by generalised limb jerking and incontinence of urine. He has been very embarrassed about the problem and did not want to come for review. She did not call an ambulance at the time as he seemed to be comfortable afterwards and she did not want the staff to see him andquot;in a messandquot;. He has a history of cerebrovascular disease having suffered a minor stroke one year earlier, and suffered a myocardial infarction some three years ago. Medication includes ramipril, amlodipine, atorvastatin and aspirin. On examination in the surgery, he looks well. His BP is 142/79 mmHg, his pulse 75 and regular. Neurological examination is unremarkable apart from some very minor loss of coordination affecting his left hand. He wants you to arrange some investigations before bothering the hospital doctors. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 121 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 8.2 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 301 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 5.1 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 149 μmol/L (60-120)   ESR 12 (less than20)   ECG Sinus rhythm Inferior Q waves    Which one of the following initial steps would be most appropriate in this case?",Carotid ultrasound scanning,EEG,Start low dose carbamazepine,Start low dose lamotrigine,Tilt table test,D,"This gentleman has developed epilepsy following a stroke. Post-stroke seizures are classified into two types:  early onset - within two weeks, of which 45% occur within 24 hours, and late onset - after two weeks, peak within 6-12 months after the stroke.  There are several causes of early onset seizures, including increased intracellular calcium and sodium with lower threshold for depolarisation, glutamate excitotoxity, and hypoxia. Seizures following haemorrhagic strokes are thought to be secondary to irritation caused by products of blood metabolism. Late-onset seizures are associated with persistent changes in neuronal excitability and glional scarring. Risk factors for developing seizures are the severity of the initial neurological deficit, the size of the lesion, cortical damage and hippocampal involvement. Seizures following strokes are typically focal, but one-third present with tonic-clonic seizures. CT, EEG and MRI can be used to investigate post-stroke epilepsy. However, EEG can be normal in 5% of cases and therefore may not alter management when you have a good history of seizure. In most cases, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are therefore indicated. 88% respond to monotherapy. The recommended first-line AEDs are carbamazepine, lamotrigine, sodium valproate and topiramate. In practice, choice of AED post-stroke is controversial and some of the newer agents such as levetiracetam and lamotrigine are increasingly used. "
cardiovascular system,8,In a STEMI secondary to cocaine use what is the underlying mechanism which leads to myocardial ischaemia and infarction?,Atherosclerotic plaque rupture,Coronary artery spasm,Embolism,Thrombosis,Tachycardia,B,Cocaine use can lead to coronary artery spasm and thus myocardial ischaemia and infarction.
cardiovascular system,9,"A 29-year-old woman with a history of depression is admitted by ambulance after being found unconscious by her boyfriend. Apparently an empty bottle of amitriptyline tablets was found at the scene. On examination her GCS is 10, her BP is 110/70 mmHg, pulse is 90 and regular. There are no other abnormal findings apart from some scars consistent with deliberate self harm. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (115-160)   White cell count 6.1 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 152 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 132 µmol/L (79-118)   Bicarbonate 12 mmol/L (22-30)   pH 7.18 (7.35-7.45)    The nurses call you over whilst you are writing up her file as she is having more prolonged runs of VT on the monitor. Which of the following is the next best step?",Give amiodarone,Give lidocaine,Give phenytoin,Give sodium bicarbonate,Observe her,D,"This is a rare occasion where sodium bicarbonate is recommended as first line therapy, here for VT/QRS widening in tricyclic poisoning. It provides exogenous sodium to overcome the competitive fast sodium channel blockade produced by tricyclics, and produces an alkalaemia (or reverses acidaemia) that mitigates the fast sodium channel blockade by the tricyclic ingested. Lidocaine is the second line choice for management of arrhythmias in this situation. It may exacerbate hypotension, so as such is not an appropriate first line choice. Phenytoin, as well as being an anticonvulsant, may also have a role in suppressing ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone or observations alone are not recommended."
cardiovascular system,10,"A 63-year-old man presented with sudden onset of severe dyspnea, orthopnea, raised JVP and bilateral basal crackles 3 days after an episode of MI. A diagnosis of acute congestive cardiac failure was made and IV furosemide was started for this patient. What electrolyte abnormality is expected?","High Na+, Low K+","Low Na+, High K+","Low Na+, Low K+","High Na+, High K+","Low Na+, Normal K+",C,"Frusemide causes hyponatremia, hypochloremic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia"
cardiovascular system,11,"A 65-year-old man presented with chest pain and was found to have ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. He was thrombolysed and has been stable on coronary care. On the third day of admission he becomes confused and agitated, and on reviewing the history it becomes apparent that he was a heavy alcohol drinker before admission, taking 80 units of alcohol per week. Which of the following management options would be most helpful in this situation?",CT brain scan,Diazepam,Haloperidol,Psychiatric referral,Thiamine,B,"This man is withdrawing from alcohol and this is associated with anxiety and tachycardia which is the last thing that someone who has just had a myocardial infarction (MI) should suffer from. Also there is a risk of seizure. Benzodiazepines are the first line of treatment for withdrawal and diazepam should be used in this situation to prevent deterioration to seizures which carry a high morbidity. You are then likely to want to put this gentleman on a reducing regimen of a longer acting benzodiazepine such as chlordiazepoxide. Thiamine replacement is critical in patients with a history of alcohol abuse, where they may have Wernicke's encephalopathy which can progress to irreversible neurology and Korsakoff's psychosis if not treatment in a timely fashion. However, the morbidity of alcohol withdrawal seizures is high and in this case I would want to give benzodiazepines first (in reality you would give the two concurrently but this is not an option here). A psychiatric referral may be necessary if his symptoms prove difficult to control but usually the psychiatry team would not be keen to intervene in what is really a medical emergency; they often advise on other strategies for sedation however. This is unlikely to be an intracerebral bleed from thrombolysis on the third day but a computerised tomography (CT) scan may be indicated if there are focal neurological signs. Haloperidol is best avoided because of the risk of causing hypotension. It can also result in prolongation of the QT interval, with risk of ventricular arrhythmias especially in patients with a recent history of cardiac damage (such as MI)."
cardiovascular system,12,A 7-year-old hypertensive white british man on thiazide diuretics needs a 2nd drug to control his BP. Which one of the following is the best choice for him?,Amlodipine (CCB),Enapril (ACEi),Propranolol (Beta blocker),Increase dose of diuretic,Prazocin (Alpha blocker),B,"In patients >55 yrs CCB. If CCB not suitable (oedema, heart failure) thiazide is preferred. In patients <55yrs ACEI or ARB. Now if patient is on CCB or Thiazide and 2nd drug is to be added it should be one of ACEI or ARB and not one from CCB or Thiazide"
cardiovascular system,13,"A 24 year old female is 22 weeks pregnant. She attends an antenatal clinic appointment. She has been very well throughout her pregnancy and has no past medical history. On examination there is no evidence of oedema. Her blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and her heart rate is 88 bpm. Auscultation reveals an ejection systolic murmur over the aortic area which radiates to the carotids and varies on posture changes. This was not evident at her previous visit and she is not complaining of chest pain, palpitations or shortness of breath.  Her chest is clear.",Mitral Regurgitation,Aortic Stenosis,Infective Endocarditis,Bicuspid Aortic Valve,Innocent murmur,E,The most likely diagnosis is an innocent murmur. The patient is pregnant and therefore this is most likely a flow murmur. These are typically crescendo decresendo systolic murmurs radiating to the carotids but the patient is otherwise well and there is no history. Innocent flow murmurs are systolic and can also occur in children. Aortic stenosis is unlikely given the age of the patient and the lack of previous history.
cardiovascular system,14,Which of the following antihypertensives is an ACE inhibitor?,Propranolol,Losartan,Felodipine,Ramipril,Verapamil,D,"Verapamil is a calcium antagonist and propranolol is a beta‐blocker.ACE inhibitors include:∙ Lisinopril∙ Trandolapril∙ Ramipril∙ Enalapril∙ Captopril.Losartan, irbesartan and eprosartan are angiotensin receptor blockers."
cardiovascular system,15,"A 54-year-old woman comes to the surgery with increasing shortness of breath over the past few months. She has received doxorubicin and trastuzumab for breast cancer and completed her last course of chemotherapy a few months earlier. On examination her BP is 100/60 mm, pulse is 88 and regular. There is bilateral pitting peripheral oedema, and crackles at the bases on auscultation of the lungs. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her cardiac failure?",Dilated cardiomyopathy,Ischaemic cardiomyopathy,Multiple pulmonary emboli,Pericardial effusion,Restrictive cardiomyopathy,A,"Anthracyclines are known to activate stress signal pathways within the heart. HER2 activation is potentially protective against the damage that this stress signaling induces, and HER2 inhibition removes this layer of protection, leading to dilated cardiomyopathy. Increasing use of trastuzumab (herceptin) has driven recognition of the problem; it is estimated to occur in 1-4% of patients treated with the drug."
cardiovascular system,16,"A man is brought to the emergency department after he was stabbed in the chest. Chest is clear bilaterally with muffled heart sounds. B 60/0mmHg, pulse 120bpm, JVP is raised. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Pulmonary embolism,Cardiac tamponade,Pericardial effusion,Hemothorax,Pneumothorax,B,Lungs clear bilaterally excludes effusion and pneumothorax. Muffled heart sound and low bp with raised jvp points towards the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade (These three signs together is known as Beck’s triad)
cardiovascular system,17,A 75-year-old man with a history of anterior MI is taking amiodarone 400 mg/day for history of VT. He has a prolonged QTc interval on his ECG of 550 ms. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?,Admit to hospital for monitoring,Atenolol,Change amiodarone to flecainide,Continue with amiodarone,Discontinue amiodarone immediately,E,"In iatrogenic long QT, which is what this is likely to be, it is safer to stop the offending drug rather than add further drugs on board (for example, beta blockers, even though atenolol is used for long QT). Flecainide is contraindicated in this situation (CAST study). Atenolol would not be indicated in this setting and though he is likley going to be admitted for monitoring the next step is to stop the amiodarone."
cardiovascular system,18,"A 72-year-old man has been advised to have antibiotic prophylaxis for some years now before dental treatment. He has never experienced chest pain. Three weeks ago, he noticed breathlessness on exertion and for one week he had orthopnea. His pulse is normal. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Aortic regurgitation,Ischemic mitral regurgitation,Mitral valve prolapse,Pulmonary stenosis,Mitral valve stenosis,E,Antibiotic prophylaxis points towards rheumatic fever. Present complaints of breathlessness and orthopnea suggests probable valvular disease. Mitral stenosis is the most common valvular complication of rheumatic fever
cardiovascular system,19,A 23 year old male with type 1 diabetes mellitus is found collapsed at home.  He is found to be in asystole by ambulance crew and attempts to resuscitate were continued for 30 minutes however he remained in asystole.  Who is the most appropriate person to decide to stop resuscitation?,A and E consultant,Parents,Medic on call,Partner,Resuscitation team leader,E,The Resuscitation Leader makes this difficult decision following agreement from the rest of the team.
cardiovascular system,20,"You are helping out the consultant in the afternoon care of the elderly clinic. Your next patient is a 92-year-old man with a history of aortic stenosis. He has annual transthoracic echocardiograms and his pressure gradient across the valve is stable. His is asymptomatic currently. After the clinic your consultant asks you to discuss each case with her. While discussing this patient, your consultant asks you to explain the pathophysiological mechanisms which occur in aortic stenosis. Which of the following is the pathophysiological response in aortic stenosis?",Concentric left ventricular hypertrophy,Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy,Increase in myocyte calcium,Reduced collagen,Significant fibrosis,A,"Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common valve problem in the United Kingdom. There are a number of compensatory mechanisms to maintain perfusion pressure. However, as time goes on and the valve becomes more narrow, these mechanisms result in the known later complications of AS. The LV hypertrophies increase (in the size of myocytes) in a concentric, rather than an eccentric (asymmetric), manner in response to the increase in afterload. There is also an increase in interstitial collagen and little fibrosis (hence reduced collagen and significant fibrosis are incorrect). There is no change in myocyte calcium."
cardiovascular system,21,Primary prevention trials for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia reveal a reduction in all-cause mortality following treatment with which of the following?,Fibrates,Fish oils,Nicotinic acid,Resins,Statins,E,"Primary prevention refers to the prevention of cardiovascular disease in subjects without pre-existing ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Although many lipid-lowering agents have demonstrated reductions in cardiovascular mortality, the question refers to all-cause mortality. WOSCOPS (pravastatin) and AFCAPS-TexCAPS (lovastatin) demonstrated reductions in overall mortality, not just cardiovascular mortality, following treatment with statins. None of the other agents are proven to reduce all-cause mortality in primary prevention. Fibrates are however well proven in secondary prevention trials (BECAIT, VA-HIT)."
cardiovascular system,22,"A 60 year old male presents with general malaise, pyrexia and night sweats.  They have a past history of rheumatic heart disease.  On examination there is evidence of a pansystolic murmur. Which is a new clinical finding.  What organism is the most likely to have caused these symptoms?",Staph. Aureus,Staph Epidermidis,Strep. Viridans,MRSA,HACEK group,C,The most common organism to lead to infective endocarditis on a native valve is Strep Viridans.  Staph Aureus and staph epidermidis are most likely to be the causative agents in prosthetic valve endocarditis.  HACEK ad MRSA are both more rare causes.
cardiovascular system,23,After surgery a patient’s left leg has become swollen and tender. The diameter of the calf has increased and passive movements cause pain. What is the most probable diagnosis?,DVT,Lymphedema,Peripheral vascular disease,Hematoma,Superficial thrombophlebitis,A,"Swelling, tenderness and enlarged calf diameter are features of DVT supported by positive Homan’s test (pain on passive movement)"
cardiovascular system,24,A 28-year-old drug user presents to emergency department collapsed and anuria. His serum K+ is 7.5 mmol/l. CXR shows early pulmonary edema. What is the next appropriate management for this patient?,Urgent hemodialysis,IV calcium gluconate,IV insulin + dextrose,Furosemide,IV 0.9% NS,B,In severe hyperkalemia IV calcium gluconate is given to protect the heart from cardiac arrest or life-threatening arrhythmias till definitive treatments are arranged
cardiovascular system,25,A 23 year old female who has history of a cardiac condition wants to start a family with her husband and has been referred to the cardiology clinic for advice. What condition is an absolute contra indication to pregnancy?,Primary pulmonary hypertension,ASD,PFO,Bicuspid aortic valve,Mitral valve prolapse,A,Pulmonary hypertension is the only absolute contraindication as it can rapidly deteriorate during pregnancy. MVP and bicuspid aortic valve should be monitored. PFO and ASD are not contraindications.
cardiovascular system,26,A 30 year old woman presents with palpitations. She is found to have a regular tachycardia of 200 bpm. She is normally fit and healthy and has no past medical history however drinks 5 mugs of coffee per day and uses alcohol excessively. She is not compromised with a blood pressure of 130/80mmHg with no chest pain and no signs of heart failure. Her bloods are all within normal parameters however the ECG confirms a narrow complex tachycardia of 200 bpm. If after giving IV adenosine 3mg and then 6mg this fails what should be the next management step?,IV verapamil,IV 12mg adenosine,IV amiodarone 900mg,IV Atenolol,DC Cardioversion,B,"For narrow complex tachycardias with no compromise then vagal manoeuvres should be trialled first. If these fails then adenosine should be utilised. After giving 3mg of adenosine with no effect, 6mg should be tried. If this fails then 12mg should be trialled. If adenosine fails then Verapamil or a beta blocker can be used as alternatives.  AS with any tachyarrythmias if the patient is compromised then DC cardioversion should be used or chemical cardioversion with IV amiodarone if this fails."
cardiovascular system,27,A 34-year-old male presents with palpitations. The ECG shows a slurred upstroke in the QRS complexes in the chest leads. Which of the following is the treatment of choice?,Amiodarone,Aspirin,Diltiazem,Radiofrequency ablation,Warfarin,D,This patient has Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome as suggested by the delta wave on ECG. Anticoagulation is not indicated. Risk of arrhythmia after ablation is of the order of 7% over five years. Amiodarone is used when there is associated AF. Diltiazem is contraindicated and aspirin has no use.
cardiovascular system,28,Serum levels of lithium are increased in women taking this anti-hypertensive drug,Methyldopa,Hydralazine,Captopril,Amlodipine,Labetalol,C,"CAPTOPRIL• Competitive inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)• ACE converts angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). Captopril’s affinity for ACE is approximately 30,000 timesgreater than that of ATI• ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system • Causes an increase in plasma renin activity due to a loss of feedback inhibition mediated by ATII on the release ofrenin and/or stimulation of reflex mechanisms via baroreceptors• One of the few ACE inhibitors that is not a prodrug• 60-75% absorbed in fasting individuals food decreases absorption by 25-40%• Metabolised by the liverIndications• Post-partum treatment of hypertension in women with chronic hypertensionContraindications• Pregnancy• Should be used with caution in renal impairment – risk of hyperkalaemiaSide-effects• Hypotension• Renal impairment• Persistent dry cough, sinusitis, rhinitis and sore throat• Angioedema• Hyperkalaemia• Derangement of liver functionInteractions• Drospirenone - Increased risk of hyperkalemia• Lithium - Increased serum levels of lithium• Potassium - Increased risk of hyperkalemia• Spironolactone - Increased risk of hyperkalemia"
cardiovascular system,29,Which of the following is true in disorders of cardiac conduction?,Deep S waves are found in leads I and V6 in left bundle branch block,Left anterior hemiblock causes right axis deviation,Left posterior hemiblock causes left axis deviation,Right bundle branch block and left axis deviation indicate bifascicular block,Right ventricular hypertrophy cannot be diagnosed in the presence of right bundle branch block,D,"The andquot;Bundle of Hisandquot; consists of three fascicles:  The right bundle branch The anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch, and The posterior fascicle of the left bundle branch.  Bifascicular block describes the combination of right bundle branch and either left anterior or left posterior hemiblock. Left anterior hemiblock causes left axis deviation, and left posterior hemiblock causes right axis deviation. A-V conduction is maintained by the remaining functional fascicle. Impaired conduction in the latter may be manifest by a prolonged P-R interval. Bifascicular block may progress to trifascicular block, and may be an indication for the insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) in isolation, is a normal ECG variant. The delayed right ventricular depolarisation results in a second positive wave in the right ventricular leads, and a second negative wave in the left ventricular leads. Diagnostic features include:  Widened QRS complex, ad Second positive wave in V1.  Other features include:  Deep slurred S waves in leads I, aVL, V4-6 S-T segment, and T wave changes in leads V1-3.  Left bundle branch block (LBBB) is always pathological. In the presence of LBBB, the diagnosis of ventricular hypertrophy, myocardial ischaemia/ infarction, and abnormalities of the P wave, QRS complex or S-T segment cannot be made using conventional ECG criteria."
cardiovascular system,30,A 17-year-old male presented with episodes of low back pain. On clinical examination he is tall and has features of Marfan syndrome. You refer him for echocardiography and he asks why it is needed. Which of the following is the most common abnormality seen in people with Marfan syndrome?,Bicuspid aortic valve,Coarctation of the aorta,Dilation of the aortic sinuses,Primum atrial septal defect,Ventricular septal defect,C,"Marfan's syndrome is associated with dialtation of the aortic sinuses, causing a dilated aortic root. This can lead to aortic root rupture or dissection. andquot;The normal aorta has three gentle bulges, the aortic sinuses, just distal to the semilunar attachments of the three leaflets of the aortic valve. The cross sectional diameter of the aorta at the nadir of the leaflet attachment where the aorta and ventricular muscle meet, and at the upper limit of the attachment at the sinutubular junction, are very similar, with the leaflets supported with a spatial relation as if to the sides of a cylinder. The diameter of the more distal circle at the sinutubular junction is, if anything, slightly smaller than the left ventricular outflow. This relation is lost in the Marfan syndrome. The aortic root becomes bulbous and the attachments of the leaflets are splayed out.andquot;^1 "
cardiovascular system,31,What is the mechanism of action of digoxin?,Inhibits Na+/Ca2+ pump,Increases sympathetic activity,Increases intracellular potassium,Activates Na+/K+ ATPase pump,Inhibits Na+/K+ ATPase pump,E,Digoxin is a selective inhibitor of the Na+/K+ ATPase pump. This leads to a rise in the intracellular sodium which then results in an increase in intracellular calcium due to the effects of the increased sodium concentration on calcium influx and efflux. This results in a positive inotropic effect. Due to its effects on the nervous system sodium pumps there is also an increase in parasympathetic activity.
cardiovascular system,32,Which of the following is not a side effect of amiodarone?,Grey discolouration of skin,Hepatoxicity,Yellow discolouration of vision,Pulmonary fibrosis,Photophobia,C,All are side effects of amiodarone except yellow discolouration of vision which is observed in digoxin toxicity.
cardiovascular system,33,"A 50-year-old man presented with increased breathlessness at rest. He is currently on furosemide, digoxin and isosorbide mononitrate. What drug is going to help him?",Ramipril,Bendroflumethiazide,Atenolol,Amlodipine,Diltiazem,B,"This is a case of diuretic resistance. Heart failure represents the most common clinical situation in which diuretic resistance is observed. In mild CHF, diuretic resistance is not commonly encountered, as long as renal function is preserved. However, in moderate and severe CHF patients, diuretic resistance occurs more frequently and often becomes a clinical problem. In diuretic resistance another diuretic is added to get optimal or desirable result. As patient is still in heart failure and pulmonary edema with the usage of loop diuretic (frusemide), a thiazide diuretic could be added with frusemide when response is inadequate. This will reduce the volume overload and improve breathing"
cardiovascular system,34,Which of the following mechanisms best explains the action of fibrates?,Bile acid sequestration,Decreases hepatic cholesterol synthesis,Increased lipoprotein lipase activity via PPAR-alpha,Increases peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids,Inhibits cholesterol absorption,C,"The effect of fibrates on the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins is due to a PPAR-alpha-dependent stimulation of lipoprotein lipase and of apolipoprotein (apo)A-V and to an inhibition of apoC-III expression, whereas the increase in plasma HDL-cholesterol depends partly on an overexpression of apoA-I and apoA-II. "
cardiovascular system,35,"According to Starling's law, when the end-diastolic volume increases, resulting in myocardial stretch, how does the heart maintain an adequate cardiac output?",Increases capillary permeability,Increases central vasodilation to redistribute the fluid to other organs,Increases myocardial contraction,Increases peripheral vasodilation to reduce strain on the heart,Increases urine production to reduce intravascular volume,C,"The cardiac output (CO) is the volume of blood being pumped by the heart in one minute, and must be maintained within a narrow range to allow normal function. It is a reflection of how well the body is being perfused, and therefore how well the body can work (perfusion enables energy production). It can be calculated from the stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR) as follows: CO = HR × SV Stroke volume, (the amount of blood pushed out of the left ventricle on each pump of the heart), is determined by many factors which are summed up in (Frank-) Starling's law. This law states that when the myocardium stretches due to blood pooling, the force of contraction increases, to preserve the stroke volume and thus the cardiac output. The diagram below shows that the ideal operating point of the heart occurs when cardiac output and venous return are equal (that is, blood in equals blood out). As end-diastolic volume increases from this point, there is greater myocardial stretch and a greater rebound contraction. The result is that cardiac output can increase but only up to a certain point. After this, cardiac output cannot increase further despite excessive end-diastolic pressure. jQuery(document).ready(function($) {$(""img[id^=2191]"").addpowerzoom( { magnifiersize: [150, 150], largeimage: \'"
cardiovascular system,36,"A 38-year-old teacher attends the hypertension clinic, having been referred via her general practitioner following a sequence of elevated systolic blood pressure readings. Though she is worried about the long term consequences of hypertension she has never trusted the medical profession, is worried about the possible side effects of medication, and wishes to control her blood pressure through alternative therapies. Which of the following interventions is part of currently advocated measures to reduce blood pressure?",Acupuncture,Ginseng,High fibre diet,Meditation,Low sodium diet,E,"The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet demonstrated a convincing and dynamic link between dietary intake and systemic blood pressure, with rapid improvement in blood pressure on a fruit and vegetable based diet with low dairy and fat consumption. However this is yet to translate into novel lifestyle modifications. Dietary salt restriction is a key and effective part of advice. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium supplements have some tenuous supporting data against the background of other contradictory studies, and are not recommended in national guidelines. Relaxation therapies for treatment of hypertension are no longer recommended by NICE as evidence of effectiveness of these therapies is inadequate. Ginseng has anecdotally been associated with hypertension. Sadly long term compliance with drastic changes in a lifelong diet is poor. Other conventional and well known lifestyle measures against hypertension include increased exercise, weight loss, moderation of alcohol intake, and smoking cessation. These aims should be reiterated when consulting any patient with new or indeed longstanding hypertension. "
cardiovascular system,37,A 70-year-old woman with longstanding anxiety is seen in the OPD. She complains of her heart skipping a beat quite often. This particularly occurs when she is trying to get to sleep. The palpitations are never sustained. What is the most likely rhythm disturbance?,SVT,VF,VT,V-ectopics (ventricular-ectopics),A-fib,D,"An ectopic rhythm is an irregular heart rhythm due to a premature heartbeat. Ventricular ectopic rhythm is also known as premature ventricular contraction, and ventricular extrasystole. When patients heart experiences an early beat, a brief pause usually follows. Ventricular-ectopics If occurs in a normal heart though symptomatic it is benign in nature but if it is secondary to heart disease like MI it may precipitate to more life threatening arrhythmia like ventricular fibrillation"
cardiovascular system,38,"A young boy is born with a heart murmur that is subsequently diagnosed as Ebstein's anomaly. Which of the following drugs, taken by the mother, may have contributed to this case of congenital heart disease?",Amiodarone,Carbimazole,Lithium,Phenytoin,Warfarin,C,Exposure to lithium in utero is associated with Ebstein's anomaly.
cardiovascular system,39,"An 83-year-old man is referred to the cardiology clinic with a history of palpitations. He presented to his GP after two days of fast, irregular palpitations. The GP noted an irregular pulse and a 12 lead ECG confirmed atrial fibrillation. He has been referred to you for assessment. In clinic today he is in sinus rhythm. His usual state of health is good; he lives independently with this wife and suffers from controlled hypertension. He has read in the newspaper about stroke risk associated with AF and asks if he needs any medication to reduce his risk. From the list, select the most appropriate response.",Aspirin 75 mg once a day,Aspirin 300 mg once a day,Clopidogrel 75 mg once a day,Warfarin,Direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC),E,"This patient is diagnosed with paroxysmal AF, and is in sinus rhythm when you review him. NICE guidelines on Atrial fibrillation (CG180) state the decision to offer antithrombotic therapy is dependent on the patient's risk rather than if they are in paroxysmal, persistent, or permanent AF. Base on their thrombotic risk vs bleeding risk a DOAC should be intitiated, now replacing warfarin as first line treatment. Useful clinic tools to decide on appropriate therapy are the CHADS2 and CHADS2-vasc scores. Clopidogrel and aspirin 300 mg OD are not recommended for this indication."

ECG sinus rhythm. What is the most appropriate investigation to be done?,Cardiac enzymes,CXR,ECG,Echo,24h ECG,E,"Episodic breathlessness, chest pain and palpitations are suggestive of paroxysmal arrhythmia. As paroxysmal arrhythmia it will only be evident during attack and in between attacks ECG will be normal (as in given case). So to confirm the diagnosis 24h ECG should be done"
cardiovascular system,41,"A 58 year old man who is a heavy smoker presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to his jaw.  On examination he is bradycardic and hypotensive and an ECG reveals ST elevation in  leads II, III and aVF.  What diagnosis fits best with this clinical picture?",Inferior NSTEMI,Unstable angina,Pancreatitis,Anterolateral STEMI,Inferior STEMI,E,The history of jaw pain should make you suspicious of cardiac pain despite the epigastric nature initially.  The ST elevation in the inferior leads confirms this man is suffering from an inferior STEMI.
cardiovascular system,42,A 60-year-old man takes atenolol for hypertension. Which of the following side effects is he most likely to be aware of two hours after taking atenolol?,Fatigue ,Hesitancy of micturition,Nausea,Orthostatic hypotension ,Somnolence,A,"Atenolol is a water soluble beta blocker, taken once daily and is not associated with drowsiness/sleep disturbance like the lipid-soluble beta blockers. It is not associated with nausea or hesitancy of micturition and would be unlikely to produce significant postural hypotension in a hypertensive subject. However, fatigue is a frequent side effect which typically is felt two hours and beyond after taking the drug. Postural hypotension is not listed as a common side effect whereas fatigue is.   "
cardiovascular system,43,"A 65 year old male with type 2 diabetes mellitus presents with severe crushing central chest pain associated with autonomic features.   This lasted for one hour before it was relieved by GTN spray.  An ECG shows anterolateral ST depression and his troponin is elevated,    He develops further chest pain at rest despite being commenced on aspirin, clopidogrel, atenolol and LMWH. An urgent coronary angiography is planned.  What other management should be initiated?",Streptokinase,IV heparin,Abciximab,Tenecteplase,None required,C,This patient is at high risk of developing a STEMI due to presenting with an NSTEMI and despite optimal medical management continuing to have pain.  He is also a diabetic.  It would therefore be appropriate to commence abciximab a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor as it has been shown to improve survival in those who are at high risk and coronary intervention is planned.
cardiovascular system,44,Which of the following is a characteristic feature of untreated Addison's disease?,Congestive cardiac failure,Hirsutism,Hypertension,Hypoglycaemia,Weight gain,D,"Addison's disease/primary hypoadrenalism is associated with:  Hypotension (often postural) Hyponatraemia Increased pigmentation, and Hypoglycaemia.  Loss of pubic hair would occur in Addison's disease irrespective of menstruant status but hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with amenorrhoea is also associated. Weight loss is typical. Congestive cardiac failure would not be expected. Adrenal autoantibodies are usually detectable."
cardiovascular system,45,"A 60-year-old man with diabetes presents to clinic for advice on prevention of a further heart attack after having sustained a myocardial infarction five years previously. He takes metformin 500 mg tds, bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg daily, and aspirin 150 mg daily. His body mass index was 33.5 kg/m^2, with a pulse of 82 beats per minute regular, and a blood pressure of 152/92 mmHg. His cholesterol concentration is 3.3 mmol/l (less than5.5). Which is the most appropriate strategy for this patient?",24 hour ambulatory ECG,Atorvastatin ,Increase aspirin from 150 mg to 300 mg daily,Orlistat ,Ramipril ,E,"The most appropriate strategy for secondary prevention would involve further blood pressure reduction with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), which would not only reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk as suggested by the HOPE study, but would also reduce microvascular risk as revealed by UKPDS. The NCEP ATPIII criteria suggest a cholesterol of less than 4, but this patient already has a low cholesterol and would not benefit as much from the addition of a statin. The increase of aspirin from 150 to 300 mg would offer no added advantage. Orlistat is used under specific criteria for weight reduction and has, as yet, not been shown to reduce CV risk in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). There is no reason here for a 24 hour tape."
cardiovascular system,46,Which of the following is most commonly associated with prolonged QT interval?,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperthyroidism,Hypocalcaemia,Hypermagnesaemia,Hyponatraemia,C,"Hypocalcaemia causes prolonged QT interval due to an increase in ST segment duration. Other causes of prolonged QT interval are:  Hypothermia Hypothyroidism Drugs (amiodarone) Acute myocarditis Cerebral injury Mitral valve prolapse Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Hypokalemia, and Hypomagnesaemia.  Hypercalcaemia can lead and hypermagnasaemia lead to shorterned QT intervals.  Hyperhyroidism can lead to atrila fibrillation and sinus taccycardia."
cardiovascular system,47,A 51-year-old Indian businessman complains of dyspnoea on exertion. He recently returned from a business trip to the USA. He has distant heart sounds on auscultation of the chest. A chest radiograph reveals that there is a thin rim of calcification surrounding the cardiac outline. Which of the following conditions is most likely responsible for these findings?,Group B coxsackie virus,Metastatic carcinoma,Sarcoidosis,Tuberculosis,Uraemia,D,"The most likely diagnosis is a constrictive pericarditis. The most probable cause for this is prior tuberculous (TB) infection which may have occurred many years previously. Acute TB would usually cause a constrictive pericarditis secondary to a pericardial effusion, but is not normally associated with calcification whereas chronic TB would. Uraemia can cause a constrictive pericarditis, as can a pericardial malignancy and coxsackie virus (secondary to a pericarditis), but calcification would be unusual. Sarcoid can cause both pericardial as well as restrictive cardiomyopathy but calcification would be unusual."

cardiovascular system,51,"A 72 year old female has recurrent episodes of collapse over the last 12 months. She has a past medical history of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia and her current medication is ramipril, bendroflumethiazide and simvastatin. You find her to be bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 bpm on examination and a blood pressure of 105/55 mmHg. on inspection of her JVP she has irregular cannon waves. The rest of her examination is unremarkable. What if the most likely diagnosis?",Mobitz type 1 heart block,Mobitz type 2 heart block,Sinus Bradycardia,Sick Sinus Syndrome,Complete heart block,E,The clue to the diagnosis is the finding of cannon waves. When the right atrium contracts against the tricuspid valve which is closed this causes a cannon wave. due to the AV dissociation in complete heart block this occurs irregularly.  The complete heart block leads to the bradycardia and thus lead to syncopal episodes and hypotension. The management is permanent pacemaker insertion.
cardiovascular system,52,A 73-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation due to ischaemic heart disease is well controlled with digoxin and amiodarone. She presents with a two month history of weight loss and palpitations. Examination reveals an irregular pulse of 110 bpm. Investigations show:    Serum TSH less than0.05 mU/L (0.2-5.5)   Serum total T4 140 nmol/L (58-174)    Which of the following would be the most useful investigation in establishing the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis?,Antithyroglobulin antibody titre,Antithyroid peroxidase antibody titre,Serum free T4 concentration,Serum reverse T3 concentration,Serum total T3 concentration,C,Amiodarone may cause both hypo- and hyperthyroidism. It also interferes in the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.  This patient appears thyrotoxic and of the measures given free T4 is most appropriate. It should not impact throglobulin or peroxidase antibodies.
cardiovascular system,53,Which of the following drugs is most likely to lead to a shortened QT interval,Digoxin,Amiodarone,Amlodipine,Erythromycin,Bisoprolol,A,Digoxin leads to shortening of the QT interval. Erythromycin and amiodarone prolong the QT interval.
cardiovascular system,54,"A 67-year-old man complains of dizziness and faintness. He has insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and he had a sigmoid colectomy three days previously. His blood pressure is 80/50 mmHg, his pulse 110 beats per min, his respiratory rate 24/min, and he has SpO2 99% on air. His plasma glucose concentration is 18 mmol/L (3.0-6.0 fasting) Which of the following is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",Arterial blood gas,Chest x ray,Electrocardiogram,Serum lactate,Urine ketones,C,"This man may have a cardiac cause for his dizziness. The highest prevalence of myocardial infarction is 72 hours post operation. Patients with diabetes may not have chest pain due to autonomic dysfunction. The differential diagnosis would include pulmonary embolus. It may also include diabetic ketoacidosis, but this would be unlikely with his glucose at 18 mmol/l and would not directly explain his hypotension. Also, he would be expected to have a slightly higher respiratory rate than 24/min. Sepsis is also a possibility, but you would expect there to be a temperature abnormality.  The most appropriate immediate investigation in this scenario would be ECG. This would help to confirm or exclude a cardiac cause. Sinus tachycardia may make the differential diagnoses more likely.  If the scenario involved a shorter postoperative time frame (up to 48 hours), exclusion of haemorrhage would take high priority."
cardiovascular system,55,"A 29-year-old female with Turner's syndrome is referred by the GP concerned about her blood pressure which he has found to be persistently elevated at between 140-160/90 mmHg. On examination she is noted to have a blood pressure of 148/92 mmHg, with no radio-femoral delay and no murmur audible. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her hypertension?",Coarctation of the aorta,Essential hypertension,Primary hyperaldosteronism,Renal artery stenosis,Single horsehoe kidney,B,"Hypertension is quite common in Turner's syndrome (10%) and is typically idiopathic - essential. In a small proportion, causes can include coarctation of the aorta and renal dysfunction due to horsehoe kidney. In this case, essential hypertension is the most likely cause but in the absence of specific features of coarctation this would again be the most appropriate option. Though Coarctation is a recognised complication there are no signs of coarctation from the history described above."
cardiovascular system,56,"A 72 year old female has a permanent pacemaker for complete heart block. She then presents with palpitations and shortness of breath and is found to be in fast atrial fibrillation. She is rate controlled and warfarin is commenced. It is decided that she should have DC cardioversion. In regards to this, which of the following is true?","During cardioversion pads placed 12-15cm away from permanent pacemaker, nil else required","Removal of pacemaker, then reinsertion following cardioversion",No extra precautions required,Cardioversion is contraindicated,"During cardioversion pads placed 12-15cm away from permanent pacemaker, pacemaker and lead function check immediately following procedure and 4-6 weeks after",E,"A permanent pacemaker or ICD is not a contraindication to DC cardioversion, however DC cardioversion can alter the settings of these devices. There is therefore certain precautions which must be taken including placing pads 12-15cm away from device and an immediate check of pacemaker and lead function and a further check at 4-6 weeks."

On examination his blood pressure was 240/120 mmHg and fundal examination reveals papilloedema with haemorrhages and cotton wool spots. His urea, electrolytes, and creatinine are normal but chest x ray reveals pulmonary oedema and cardiomegaly. Which one of the following is the most appropriate immediate treatment?",Atenolol 50 mg orally,Intravenous labetalol,Intravenous sodium nitroprusside,Nifedipine 5 mg sublingually,Nifedipine LA 30 mg orally,C,"This patient has malignant hypertension with papilloedema, convulsions, and pulmonary oedema. Management must be in secondary care and the patient must have bed rest with regular assessment of blood pressure. Intravenous nitroprusside is the treatment of choice in the UK, allowing reduction of blood pressure at a safe rate. Labetolol or nicardipine are alternatives, and can be used as oral options following initial control of blood pressure. Labetolol is not favoured as the first-line treatment option as it can result in rapid reduction of blood pressure which can lead to cerebral infarction in watershed areas. Nifedipine and Nifedipine long acting are also not favoured for that reason. Oral formulations are not recommended in the initial stages of management as they usually do not have as rapid an onset of action, and cannot be titrated as quickly as is required."

The commonly encountered haemodynamic findings in hypovolaemic shock include:  A decrease in stroke volume, cardiac output and filling pressures (i.e. central venous pressure and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure) An increase in heart rate and systemic vascular resistance."
cardiovascular system,62,"You are working as part of the on-call medical team and a GP calls for some advice about a 62-year-old male patient. He is a heavy smoker and has a long and extensive history of peripheral vascular disease. He has had two recent admissions under the vascular surgeons, both occasions requiring embolectomy surgery. His GP is unsure which medication to start to reduce his risk of an occlusive vascular event. Unfortunately, the patient is intolerant of aspirin with documented severe allergy. There is no history of stroke or TIA. The patient is in sinus rhythm. Based on this information and with regard to current NICE guidance, which management option listed is recommended to reduce occlusive vascular events in this patient?",Clopidogrel,Dabigatran,Dipyridamole modified release,Dipyridamole modified release with clopidogrel,Warfarin,A,"In 2010 NICE released a technology appraisal on the use of clopidogrel and modified release dipyridamole in the prevention of occlusive vascular events. It relates to patients who have had an occlusive vascular event or have established peripheral artery disease (PAD), as with this patient. Clopidogrel is the first line option for those who have PAD but cannot tolerate aspirin. Dipyridamole MR is an option for patients who have had a stroke or a TIA but not primary prevention. In combination with aspirin, dipyridamole can be used if the patient has had a TIA or if they have had a stroke and cannot tolerate clopidogrel.It is an option used alone if they have had a stroke and aspirin/clopidogrel are not tolerated or if they have suffered a TIA and aspirin is not tolerated. Warfarin is not indicated if they are in sinus rhythm. Dipyridamole is not indicated in combination with clopidogrel. Dabigatran is indicated for thromboembolic events post orthopaedic surgery or AF. Therefore for primary prevention of occlusive vascular events in patients with established PAD but who have not had a stroke/TIA, clopidogrel is the most appropriate choice. "
cardiovascular system,63,"A 68 year old female has recently had a mitral valve replacement.  She presents feeling generally unwell, feverish with night sweats and weight loss.  On examination she is pyrexial and there is a murmur in the aortic area and inflammatory markers are raised. Blood cultures are taken. What other investigation is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?",ESR,ECG,Troponin,Transoesophageal Echocardiogram,Transthoracic Echocardiogram,D,The diagnosis you would be suspecting is infective endocarditis. The major criteria in Dukes criteria require two positive blood cultures and echocardiogram findings. TOE has been shown to be more sensitive and is more useful for visualising mitral valve lesions as in this case.
cardiovascular system,64,"A 72 year old gentleman with a history of ischaemic heart disease, has been unwell with diarrhoea and vomiting. He complains of intermittent palpitations and dizziness.  He is brought to hospital and starts to complain of an episode and is found to have a broad complex tachycardia with the QRS complexes appearing to twist around the baseline. His blood pressure is 140/90 and GCS is 15. How would you manage this patient?",Adrenaline,Amiodarone,Atropine,Adenosine,IV Magnesium,E,"The most likely diagnosis is Torsades de Pointes.   This polymorphic ventricular tachycardia occurs when there is a prolonged QT interval which leads to the QRS complexes amplitudes varying.  Prolonged QT syndrome can be secondary to congenital long QT syndrome such as Jervell and Lange Nielsen or can be secondary to MI, certain drugs such as erythromycin, tricyclic antidepressants and antipsychotic or metabolic abnormalities such as hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesaemia or hypokalaemia (secondary to diarrhoea and vomiting in this case). The treatment of choice in stable patients (as in this case) is IV magnesium. Obviously if a patient is unstable then DC Cardioversion is required."

Which of the following echocardiographic measures would be mandatory?,Aortic valve peak velocity,Left ventricular end diastolic diameter,M-mode of the aortic valve,M-mode of the mitral valve,Pulse wave of mitral inflow,B,"One way of measuring ejection fraction (EF) is estimated by the ratio between the M-mode readings of the left ventricular end diastolic volume (EDV) and the end systolic volume (ESV), using the formula [(EDV - ESV) / EDV] x 100 = EF (%). You can also obtain the ejection fraction by dividing the volume ejected by the heart (stroke volume) by the end-diastolic volume (volume of the filled heart)."
cardiovascular system,66,"A 27-year-old woman presented with a history of sudden onset right-sided weakness and dysphasia lasting eight hours. She had returned by plane to the United Kingdom from Australia two days previously. She is obese and takes Microgynon but the remainder of physical examination was normal. Chest x ray, ECG and a CT head scan were all normal. Which one of the following investigations is most likely to reveal the underlying cause of this episode?",Carotid Doppler ultrasonography,Cerebral angiography,MRI of head,Transoesophageal echocardiography,Transthoracic echocardiography,D,"The history here suggests a lower limb deep vein thrombosis with peripheral embolus through a patent foramen ovale, leading to symptoms of left sided cerebral ischaemia. This is termed the paradoxical embolus - so-called because a thromboembolus arising from the venous circulation can end up in the systemic circulation. Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) is the investigation of choice to investigate for a patent foramen ovale, although transthoracic echocardiography with contrast may be an alternative. TOE offers better views of the anatomical area."
cardiovascular system,67,"The body of a 65-year-old man who was treated for TB and bronchitis was seen at autopsy. His legs were swollen and his liver showed signs of a transudate fluid. What was the cause of the

What is the most likely diagnosis?",Iron deficiency anaemia,B12 deficiency,Haemolytic anaemia,Cholangitis,Infective endocarditis,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Haemolytic anaemia due to cardiac haemolysis. The mechanical valve can cause direct trauma to the red cells and thus lead to lysis. Haemolytic anaemia is evidenced by the reduced haemoglobin, increased reticulocyte count, increased LDH, increased unconjugated bilirubin and reduced haptoglobin.  Spherocytes and fragmented red cells can appear on blood film."
cardiovascular system,69,A 68 year old male presents with severe central chest pain. He is found to have ST elevation in the anterolateral leads. A primary PCI is performed and a stent inserted. He is then found to be hypotensive at 70/40 with a few bibasal crepitations. Heart sounds are pure. A central line is inserted and his pulmonary artery wedge pressure is 12 mmHg. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?,IV furosemide,Inotropes,Fluid Restriction,Repeat PCI,IV fluids,E,"Hypotension can occur following an MI for numerous reasons. These include hypovolaemia, decreased left ventricular filling secondary to right ventricular failure, GTN therpay leading to vasodilatation and mechanical failure due to for example large infarcts. There is a low PCWP suggesting the patient may be underfilled and it is appropriate to give IV fluid challenges to optimise this before treating other potential causes and before inotropes can be commenced if appropriate."

Which of the following is NOT in keeping with a diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis?,Ascites,Low JVP with no x and y descent,Orthopnoea,Peripheral oedema,Previous cardiac surgery,B,"Constrictive pericarditis typically impedes late diastolic ventricular filling, which produces an elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP), with prominent x and y descent. Pulsus paradoxus is a variable finding, unless a pericardial effusion with an abnormally elevated pressure exists. Other signs include:  Oedema Ascites Hepatomegaly Orthopnoea Dyspnoea.  Constrictive pericarditis may be a subtle cause of dyspnoea after cardiac surgery."

A history of ischaemic heart disease is also more indicative of ventricular tachycardia as opposed to SVT with aberrant conduction.
cardiovascular system,73,"A 74-year-old patient with a history of ischaemic heart disease presents with shortness of breath. He is finding difficulty mobilising any further than around his home. An ECHO demonstrates an ejection fraction of approximately 20%. He is on maximal drug therapy for heart failure, and is not thought to have an infective chest exacerbation. An ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm with a rate of 75/min and widened QRS complexes. Which is the most appropriate treatment option?",Addition of perhexiline therapy,Palliation as an inpatient with PRN morphine,Referral for biventricular pacing,Referral for cardiac transplant,Referral for implantable defibrillator,C,"This patient by definition has NYHA III heart failure (HF). The CARE-HF study of heart failure patients has shown a 37% reduction in the primary end point of death and cardiovascular hospitalisation and a reduction of 36% in all-cause mortality compared with control. Control patients were treated with maximal medical therapy only, and follow up was a mean of 29 months. Examination of the COMPANION study demonstrates a 40% reduction in the risk of death or hospitalisation from HF, and a 36% reduction in death from any cause, after implantation of biventricular pacing wires with a defibrillator. It may be that in the very near future we will be implanting biventricular pacing devices, with defibrillator actions, in those patients in the subject groups included in these studies. The indications for implantation devices in these studies were: low ejection fraction, dyssynchrony on the ECG (widened QRS), and NYHA III/IV. Perhexiline therapy may become standard therapy in this patient subgroup in the future, but as yet there is no mortality or morbidity evidence to support its widespread use. "

On auscultation his heart sounds are normal however there is evidence of a left femoral bruit.,Cholesterol embolism,Contrast Nephropathy,Embolism from Femoral Artery,Peripheral Vascular Disease,Renal artery stenosis,A,"Cholesterol embolisation is a risk following catheterisation. The risk is increased if there is a past medical history of peripheral vascular disease, stroke, hypertension or age of over 60. Cholesterol embolisation has a very poor prognosis. A trial of dialysis may help recover some renal function but anticoagulation is not useful."
cardiovascular system,75,Which of the following concerning the use of intravenous bicarbonate in cardiorespiratory arrest is correct?,Exacerbates intracellular acidosis,Has a positive inotropic effect on ischaemic myocardium,Improves oxygen release to the tissues,Increases cerebral blood flow,Reduces pre-existent hyperkalaemia,A,"Bicarbonate therapy can increase extracellular pH only if the carbon dioxide (CO2) produced can be removed by adequate ventilation. Indeed, if hypercapnia occurs then as CO2 crosses cell membranes easily, intracellular pH may decrease even further with further deterioration of cellular function. Bicarbonate has a negative inotropic effect, reducing cerebral blood flow; it shifts the oxygen dissociation curve to the left, inhibiting oxygen release to tissues."

Which one of the following drugs would improve the patient's prognosis further?,Amiodarone ,Digoxin ,Diltiazem ,Isosorbide mononitrate,Metoprolol ,E,"This patient has NYHA grade II heart failure and is already receiving angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and diuretics. Studies such as CIBIS, MERIT HF, and COPERNICUS clearly demonstrate the advantage of beta blockers even with severe heart failure."
cardiovascular system,77,"A 56-year-old man with a history of type 2 diabetes is admitted to the Emergency Department with nausea and vomiting. He has been unable to keep fluids down for the past few days, but has continued to take his medication, including lisinopril and a loop diuretic.  On examination his BP is 105/70 mmHg, pulse is 80 bpm and regular. Heart sounds are normal, and his chest is clear. His abdomen is soft but is mildly tender. You are alerted by the nursing staff to his venous blood gas results which show potassium of 7.5 mmol/l, and his ECG which shows tall peaked T waves. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",IV calcium gluconate,IV insulin and dextrose,IV normal saline,Oral calcium resonium,Salbutamol nebuliser,A,"The answer is IV calcium gluconate. This man has life threatening hyperkalaemia, most likely as a result of pre-renal acute kidney injury. The tall T-waves indicate the myocardium has become sensitised by the hyperkalaemia, and this can deteriorate to VF or VT. IV calcium gluconate should therefore be given immediately, with cardiac monitoring, to stabilise the myocardium. Its effect is short-lived (approximately 15-30 minutes) but does allow time for more definitive management. IV insulin and dextrose should then be given to reduce potassium levels, and salbutamol nebulisers can also be used but are less effective. IV hydration will ultimately be required, but the hyperkalaemia should be dealt with initially. Oral calcium resonium is a potassium binder which slowly reduces potassium, and it is of more use in chronic hyperkalaemia rather than the acute situation seen here."
cardiovascular system,78,During auscultation of the heart you discover a wide fixed splitting of the second heart sound. In which of the following conditions does this occur?,An uncomplicated ASD,Aortic stenosis,Constrictive pericarditis,Fallot's tetralogy,Right bundle branch block (RBBB),A,There is a single sound in Fallot's because of an absent P2. Aortic stenosis leads to reversed splitting (also seen with left bundle branch block [LBBB] and ventricular pacemaker). In RBBB there is wide splitting of S2 but it is not fixed.
cardiovascular system,79,"A randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled trial of a cholesterol-lowering drug in the primary prevention of coronary heart disease is reported. 1000 subjects are treated with the active drug, and 1000 are given placebo. They are followed up over a five year period and 100 individuals in the placebo group and 80 in the treatment group suffer a myocardial infarction (MI). Which of the following is the annual percentage risk of myocardial infarction in the group treated with placebo?",0.50%,2%,5%,8%,10%,B,"In the five years, 100 patients in the placebo group develop an MI. Assuming this is spread evenly across the years this means that 20 patients (out of 1000) suffer an MI each year. The annual risk is therefore 20/1000 = 0.02 which, expressed as a percentage is 2."
cardiovascular system,80,"A 60-year-old male with an eight year history of type 2 diabetes is being treated with metformin 1 g twice daily and gliclazide 160 mg twice daily. He is obese, has gained weight over the last year and his HbA1c has deteriorated from 59 to 64 mmol/mol (20-42). He is being considered for treatment with either insulin or pioglitazone. The patient wants to know the side effects of pioglitazone. Which of the following is regarded as a typical side effect of pioglitazone therapy?",Acanthosis nigricans,Fluid retention,Lactic acidosis,Myositis,Photosensitivity rash,B,"Pioglitazone may cause fluid retention in up to 10% of patients. This effect may be exacerbated by concomitant use with other drugs that cause fluid retention (for example, NSAIDs, calcium antagonists). Weight gain with pioglitazone is caused by a combination of fat accumulation and fluid retention. Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with cardiac failure. Lactic acidosis is a recognised side effect of metformin. Some sulphonylureas may cause a photosensitivity rash. Statins and fibrates are associated with myositis."
cardiovascular system,81,A knife stabbed horizontally through the fourth intercostal space to the right of the sternum is most likely to damage which of the following?,Descending aorta,Hemiazygos vein,Right brachiocephalic vein,Right pulmonary artery,Thoracic duct,D,"The hemiazygos vein, descending aorta and thoracic duct are found on the left. The right brachiocephalic vein is formed behind the sternoclavicular joints by the union of the internal jugular and subclavian veins. The left and right brachiocephalic veins join at the middle of the right border of the manubrium to form the superior vena cava. The superior vena cava enters the right atrium at the level of the right third costal cartilage."
cardiovascular system,82,You are investigating the use of novel markers which may show myocardial damage within the first three hours after myocardial infarction to see if this may improve early diagnosis of damage. Which of the following is the most appropriate marker?,CKMB,Glycogen phosphorylase isoenzyme BB (GPBB),LDH,Troponin I,Troponin T,B,"GPBB is an isoenzyme of glycogen phosphorylase which exists in cardiac muscle. By three hours post myocardial infarction it has risen significantly. As such it is an appropriate marker for early cardiac muscle injury. Cardiac troponins are the most widely used test following a myocardial infarct in the UK. Both troponin I and T are highly sensitive and specific for cardiac damage, and are of equal clinical value. Serum levels begin to increase within 3-12 hours from the onset of pain, peak at 24-48 hours and return to baseline over 5-14 days. CK-MB levels also increase within 3-12 hours of onset of chest pain and peak within 24 hours, but return to baseline quicker than troponin (after 48-72 hours). Sensitivity and specificity are not as high as for troponin levels. The most sensitive early marker for myocardial infarction is myoglobin (troponin may not rise until 6 hours following myocyte injury). Myoglobin can be detected within 2 hours of cardiac myocyte damage, but is not specific as it is also present in skeletal muscle. LDH is also less specific than troponin, although the LDH-1 isoenzyme is predominantly found in cardiac muscle so a high LDH-1:LDH-2 ratio can indicate myocardial damage. Levels begin to rise 24-48 hours, peak at 72 hours, and remain elevated for 10 days. It is not widely used in UK practice. "
cardiovascular system,83,Which one of the following is a contraindication to thrombolysis?,Age over 75 years,Asthma,Background diabetic retinopathy,Previous history of hemorrhagic stroke,The presence of atrial fibrillation,D,Those over 75 years benefit from thrombolysis as much or more than younger patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Proliferative diabetic retinopathy is a relative contraindication. Important contraindications to thrombolysis include:  Gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding Heavy vaginal bleeding Recent stroke or surgery Uncontrolled severe hypertension Previous history of hemorrhagic stroke Prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) (more than half an hour).
cardiovascular system,84,A 65-year-old man with hypertension presents with lower abdominal pain and back pain. An expansive abdominal mass is palpated lateral and superior to the umbilicus. What is the single most discriminating investigation?,Laparascopy,KUB XR,Pelvic US,Rectal exam,Abdominal US,E,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA or triple A) is a localized enlargement of the abdominal aorta such that the diameter is greater than 3 cm or more than 50% larger than normal. They usually cause no symptoms, except during rupture. Occasionally, abdominal, back, or leg pain may occur. Single most discriminating investigation is abdominal ultrasound"
cardiovascular system,85,A 65-year-old woman complains of a painful discharging ulcer above her ankle on the inner side of her left lower leg. Examination: the base of the ulcer is red and covered by a yellow fibrous tissue. The border is irregular. The skin is tight. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Arterial ischemia ulcer,Malignancy,Neuropathic ulcer,Pressure ulcer,Venous stasis ulcer,E,Some people with venous insufficiency develop stasis dermatitis. Blood pools in the veins of the lower leg. Fluid and blood cells leak out of the veins into the skin. It is usually seen above ankle and inner side of leg
cardiovascular system,86,"A 65-year-old male presents with dyspnea and palpitations. Examination: pulse 170 bpm, BP 120/80 mmHg. Carotid massage has been done as first instance. What is the next step of the management?",Adenosine,Amlodipine,DC cardioversion,Lidocaine,Beta blocker,A,"The likely diagnosis is SVT. 1st vagal maneuvers (carotid sinus massage, Valsalva manoeuvre), if fails then next is to give iv adenosine"
cardiovascular system,87,A 29-year-old woman presents with acute right sided weakness. She has one child aged 4 years and had two spontaneous abortions in the past. After the birth of her child she developed a DVT and required three months' anticoagulation with warfarin. Examination revealed a right hemiparesis. A CT head scan showed a left middle cerebral artery territory infarct. Which is the most likely finding on echocardiography?,Atrial septal defect,Bicuspid aortic valve,Left atrial myxoma,Normal appearances,Ventricular septal defect,D,"This patient has a prothrombotic tendency suggestive of the lupus anticoagulant with recurrent abortions, previous deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and now she has developed a right hemiparesis. This has occurred off warfarin and it is highly unlikely to be due to any right to left transference of clot. It is more likely to be due to spontaneous infarct related to the thrombophilia and her heart is likely to be normal."
cardiovascular system,88,"A 60-year-old man has left ventricular failure and clinically he is classified as NYHA Class III. He takes furosemide, aspirin, and ramipril. The addition of which one of the following beta blockers would be expected further to improve his prognosis?",Acebutolol,Bisoprolol,Esmolol,Propranolol,Sotalol,B,"Bisoprolol is a highly selective beta1-adrenoceptor antagonist. Administration of bisoprolol to patients with chronic heart failure is associated with increases in left ventricular function and reductions in heart rate; increases in heart rate variability are also seen. Two major randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre trials have examined the clinical efficacy of bisoprolol in combination with ACE inhibitors and diuretics in patients with stable chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class III or IV). "
cardiovascular system,89,Which of the following statements concerning the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (MI) is correct?,A pansystolic murmur developing within the first 24 hours does not require further investigation,Dipyridamole therapy reduces reinfarction within the first year,Heparin is beneficial if given with streptokinase,Prophylactic lidocaine given in the first 48 hours is effective in preventing ventricular fibrillation,Treatment with a dihydropyridine short acting calcium antagonist nifedipine is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality,E,GISSI II revealed no survival advantage of heparin plus streptokinase in acute MI compared with streptokinase alone. ISIS II revealed that short acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nifedipine was associated with increased cardiovascular risk after MI. Dipyridamole does not reduce risk. A newly discovered pansystolic murmur may signify acquired mitral regurgitation (MR) or ventricular septal defect (VSD).
cardiovascular system,90,A 69-year-old woman admitted for a surgical procedure is noted to have a soft systolic murmur at the left sternal edge. Her ECG and chest x ray were normal and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a small posterior pericardial effusion with normal valves. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step in this patient's management?,A diagnostic pericardial aspiration,Mammography,Purified protein derivative test for tuberculosis,Reassurance,Right heart catheterisation,D,"The presence of a small pericardial effusion on echo is quite common and in this patient who otherwise appears well, no further action is required."
cardiovascular system,91,"A 52 year old gentleman is 5 days post STEMI when he starts to develop chest pain.  It is pleurtic in nature and worse on lying down.  He is pyrexial and generally unwell.  On examinatio he is tachycardic and there is evidence of a pericardial friction rub. On ECG there is widespread ST elevation.   Given the most likely diagnosis, what management should be initiated?",Iv antibiotics,NSAIDs,Thrombolysis,IV heparin,PCI,B,"This patient presents with symptoms and signs of Dresslers syndrome.  It is thought to be an immunological reaction which leads to pericarditis and presetns normally 2 to 5 days following MI but can present up to 3 months. As well as chest pain the patient is often suffering from malaise and pyrexia.  There may a leucocytosis , eosinophilia and raised ESR.   AS with any other causes of pericarditis pericardial; friction rub and widespread ST elevation may be evident.  NSAIDs are useful in the management and corticosteroids have been used in patients with severe symptoms."
cardiovascular system,92,Which of the following statements regarding B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is correct?,BNP augments sodium reabsorption in the kidney,BNP causes arterial and venous smooth muscle dilatation,BNP is synthesised predominantly in the cerebrovascular circulation,BNP synthesis is decreased by thyroid hormone,The stimulus for BNP release is increased ventricular pressure load,B,"The ventricular myocardium is the primary site of BNP synthesis. The stimulus for BNP release is myocyte stretch, rather than transmural pressure load. BNP synthesis is increased by thyroid hormones as well as glucocorticoids, endothelin-1, angiotensin-II, and tachycardia, independent of the haemodynamic effects of these factors. In the kidney, BNP causes increased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and inhibition of sodium reabsorption, leading to natriuresis and diuresis. BNP leads to reduced blood pressure, and reduced pre-load due to relaxing effects on vascular smooth muscle. "
cardiovascular system,93,"A 22-year-old golf course groundsman develops sudden onset of breathlessness and right-sided chest pain whilst maintaining the 18th hole. He is rushed to hospital, but his condition worsens when being examined by a junior doctor. She reported finding a trachea that was deviated to the left, and hearing very distant breath sounds over his right lung. Following the intervention of a senior doctor, his condition improves rapidly. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Myocardial infarction,Pericarditis,Pneumonia,Pulmonary embolism,Tension pneumothorax,E,"Sudden onset of chest pain and respiratory distress in a previously fit young man should alert one to the diagnosis of pneumothorax. Tales of patients who developed a clinically obvious tension pneumothorax in hospital are told frequently, so it is best to be able to recognise one if it occurs while you are actually examining the patient! The condition is treated by needle thoracocentesis in the second intercostal space. There is no role for obtaining chest radiography prior to intervention."
cardiovascular system,94,A 67-year-old woman is admitted with blackouts. Her electrocardiogram shows ventricular escape with complete heart block. As you are standing there she blacks out once more. Her rhythm strip shows P wave asystole. Which of the following would be the initial immediate treatment here after airway and breathing?,Adenosine 6 mg,Adrenaline 1 mg,Atropine 0.6 mg,Transcutaneous pacing,Transvenous pacing,D,"Occasionally, atrial electrical activity continues in the absence of ventricular impulses. This is referred to as P wave asystole and may respond to electrical pacing. This can be achieved by transvenous, transcutaneous or manual techniques. Transvenous pacing takes longer to instigate, and transcutaneous pacing is therefore the initial choice here. Manual pacing is an effective holding measure before more definitive pacing is instituted. Atropine can also be used, as can adrenaline, for sustained P wave asystole but pacing is the initial treatment of choice. All crash trollies within UK hospitals contain the equipment required to externally pace patients. Adenosine can induce asystole, and is only indicated in the treatment of supraventricular tachycardias."
cardiovascular system,95,A 70-year-old man was referred by his GP with difficulty in treating hypertension. He had longstanding hypertension which had been well controlled over many years but recently he was found to have a blood pressure of 190/110 mmHg which proved resistant to additional treatment. He was generally asymptomatic and complied with medication. Investigations showed normal U+Es. Which one of the following is the most likely cause?,Chronic pyelonephritis ,Conn’s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism) ,Phaeochromocytoma ,Polycystic kidney disease ,Renovascular disease ,E,"Primary hyperaldosteronism (Conn's syndrome) typically has hypokalaemic alkalosis. One should also suspect Conn's with patients resistant to conventional antihypertensive treatment and with the electrolytes in the direction of Conn's without necessarily being outside the normal range (plasma Na greater than 140 and K less than 4). However, in this patient's case, he has longstanding hypertension which has deteriorated and normal electrolytes. Therefore the most likely cause is renovascular disease related to his hypertension. Renovascular disease is due to disease affecting the arterial supply of the kidney(s). The resulting renal hypoperfusion leads to hyperactivation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, causing hypertension. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause, but Takayasu's arteritis and fibromuscular dysplasia can be the underlying issue. Renovascular disease is asymptomatic in its early stages. It subsequently leads to hypertension, which can be resistant to standard treatment. It can also lead to renal impairment when patients are started on ACE inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, hypokalaemia or flash pulmonary oedema. Renal function often remains normal until the late stages of disease. Acute renal failure can occur in rapidly advancing cases, or if there are additional renal insults. A definitive diagnosis is usually made using angiography. Management involves optimising vascular risk factors, cautious use of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists, and avoiding other nephrotoxics. Vascular intervention, such as stenting, is also possible but there is no good consensus in clinical practice about the benefit of this, and it is often decided on an individual level. The ASTRAL trial showed no significant difference between stenting and medical therapy, but only included patients where the treating physician was unsure of which intervention should be used. Chronic pyelonephritis and polycystic kidney disease tend to lead to renal impairment, in addition to hypertension. Phaeochromocytomas cause paroxysms of severe hypertension, rather than longstanding hypertension. "
cardiovascular system,96,What treatment should be utilised in maintaining the patency of a PDA before surgery?,Indometacin,Prostaglandin E1 administration,Nil required,Ibuprofen,Prostaglandin inhibitor,B,The patent ductus arteriosus is kept patent before surgery by prostaglandin E1 and this should be utilised. Prostaglandin inhibitors such as indomethacin and ibuprofen should be avoided.
cardiovascular system,97,"A 75 year old presents with shortness of breath on exertion. On further questioning she is unable to lie flat due to breathlessness and has woken up during the night gasping for air. She has a history of hypertension. On examination there is bibasal crackles. The CXR reveals small bilateral pleural effusions, upper lobe diversion and bat wing oedema. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pulmonary oedema,Pneumonia,Interstitial Lung Disease,COPD,Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis,A,"The patient describes orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea which are characteristic of pulmonary oedema. The CXR is also indicative as pulmonary oedema shows bilateral pleural effusion, perihilar shadowing (bat wing oedema), upper lobe diversion and Kerley B lines. The background of hypertension suggests an underlying cause for her cardiac failure."
cardiovascular system,98,Which of the following is correct regarding warfarin therapy?,Affects the intrinsic pathway by prolonging the the prothrombin time,Bleeding may be controlled by withholding vitamin K,"Interferes with the production of factors III, VI, XI and XII",Is a vitamin K agonist,Is not safe to use in pregnancy,E,"Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and interferes with the production of factors II, VII, IX and X. Its activity can be monitored by measuring the prothrombin time which tests the integrity of the extrinsic and final common pathways of the coagulation cascade. Bleeding in a patient who is receiving warfarin therapy may be controlled with either fresh frozen plasma or vitamin K depending on the urgency. Warfarin is teratogenic and should be avoided in the first trimester of pregnancy."
cardiovascular system,99,An 82-year-old male suddenly becomes unconscious and fell down. He recovered completely within minutes. What is the best investigation you do to diagnose the case?,ECG,EEG,Blood glucose level,CT,CXR,A,Here sudden unconsciousness without any provocation makes arrhythmia the most likely cause; hence we should do ECG
cardiovascular system,100,A 29 year old female who was on methadone dies suddenly whilst out running. Which of the following is the most likely cause?,Intracranial Haemorrhage,Prolonged QT,Methadone overdose,VF,SVT,B,Methadone can lead to a prolonged QT interval. Torsades de point is therefore a risk.
cardiovascular system,101,"A 47-year-old lady is admitted to the coronary care unit with symptoms suggestive of decompensated heart failure. She has a history of severe mitral regurgitation secondary to mitral prolapse and is awaiting valve surgery. You are asked to admit the patient and the medical student attached to the firm asks to come with you. You take a full history and examine the patient, making sure to point out all the relevant clinical features to the medical student. After you finish seeing the patient you discuss the case with the medical student. She asks you the most common cause of mitral regurgitation (MR). Which of the following should be your response to the medical student's question?",Collagen vascular disease,Infective endocarditis,Myxomatous degeneration,Rheumatic fever,Rupture of the chordate tendinae,C,"Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve is by far the most common cause of MR in the United Kingdom. The others listed are less common causes. The management of severe MR is surgery; either replacement or repair, depending on the anatomy. A percutaneous repair with clips is possible in some patients unsuitable for conventional surgery."
cardiovascular system,102,An elderly gentleman has a syncopal episode.  He is found to have an ejection systolic murmur and an ECHO confirms Aortic Stenosis.  In AS what indicates a poor prognosis?,Coexistent AR,LVH,Infective Endocarditis,Bicuspid Valve,LVF,E,LVF indicates the worse prognosis.  AS with symptoms has a poor prognosis with risk of sudden death.
cardiovascular system,103,"Regarding cardiac tamponade in children, which of the following is correct?",Blood accumulates outside the pericardial sac,Blood volume available for ventricular filling during systole is reduced,Distended neck veins are always apparent,Emergency needle pericardiocentesis is contraindicated,This may occur following blunt trauma,E,"Cardiac tamponade may follow blunt or penetrating injury. Blood accumulates within the pericardial sac and during diastole less blood volume is available for ventricular filling, leading to reduced cardiac output and circulatory shock. Distended neck veins may not be present if there is coexisting hypovolaemia. Emergency pericardiocentesis is necessary followed by referral to cardiothoracic surgeons."
cardiovascular system,104,"A 50 year old woman presents with left arm and leg weakness of 5 hours duration. She is known to have AF. She is hypertensive but her AF is rate controlled with a HR of 80. Neurological exam confirms 4/5 weakness but there is nil else remarkable, bloods are normal and CT head shows no evidence of haemorrhage. As there is no evidence of haemorrhage on CT, what anti platelet or anticoagulant are yo going to prescribe?",None,IV Heparin,Thrombolysis,Warfarin to be commenced covered by LMWH,Aspirin,E,As the symptoms have been present for 5 hours then thrombolysis is not appropriate as it it only recommended for up to 4 hours. Due to her AF she will need to be anticoagulated and it is recommended this should be delayed until 2 weeks later although this varies as there is early risk of haemorrhagic transformation. Aspirin should be commenced in the meantime.
cardiovascular system,105,In adult basic life support which of the following is the correct ratio of chest compressions to ventilations?,5 to 1,8 to 1,10 to 1,15 to 2,30 to 2,E,"Fifteen compressions to two breaths was the recommended ratio regardless of the number of rescuers performing basic life support, but the latest guidelines now suggest 30:2.

cardiovascular system,106,"A 62-year-old man has experienced substernal chest pain upon exertion with increasing frequency over the past one year. An electrocardiogram shows T wave inversion in the anterolateral leads at rest. He has a total serum cholesterol of 7.0 mmol/l (less than5.2). On angiography, he has an 85% narrowing of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Which of the following events is most likely to occur in this patient?",A systemic artery embolus from a left atrial mural thrombus,A systemic artery embolus from a left ventricular mural thrombus,A systemic artery embolus from thrombosis in a peripheral vein,Pulmonary embolism from a left ventricular mural thrombus,Pulmonary embolism from thrombosis in a peripheral vein,B,The suggestion here is that this man has coronary artery disease with an impending myocardial infarction. Infarction of the LAD would cause necrosis of the left ventricle. Thrombus may form on an area of dyskinetic ventricle. Therefore he is most at risk of embolus of thrombus from the left ventricle (LV).
cardiovascular system,107,A 30-year-old male presents with several weeks' history of blood and mucous diarrhoea. He has a frequency of bowel movement of eight times during the day and has to wake up three times at night to have a bowel movement. Unprepared flexible sigmoidoscopy shows an inflamed colonic mucosa. Which of the following features is most likely to indicate that this patient has disease extending to involve the right colon?,A tachycardia of greater than 100 per minute,Constipation with distal limit at the hepatic flexure,CRP of greater than 100,Distended loops of small bowel,Serum albumin level of less than 30 g/L,D,"The patient has ulcerative colitis. The presence of distended small bowel loops would suggest incompetence of the ileocaecal valve, indicating right colonic involvement. There is often constipation proximal to the inflamed bowel. The distal limit of constipation provides a crude estimate of the proximal limit of colonic inflammation. The following are markers of severe disease (which may fail medical therapy) but do not help define the anatomical extent of disease:  Tachycardia Hypoalbuminaemia, and A high C reactive protein level (particularly which does not respond to steroid therapy)."
cardiovascular system,108,"A 26-year-old professional footballer collapses while playing football. He is rushed to the Emergency department, and is found to be in ventricular tachycardia. He is defibrillated successfully and his 12 lead ECG following resuscitation demonstrates left ventricular hypertrophy. Ventricular tachycardia recurs and despite prolonged resuscitation he dies. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic stenosis,Cocaine intoxication,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Myocardial infarction,Pulmonary embolism,C,"The history of sudden arrhythmia in a young, previously well, individual is suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Relatives should be screened for the condition. The majority of patients with HCM have an abnormal resting ECG, although the changes are non-specific and include left ventricular hypertrophy, ST changes and T-wave inversion. There may also be right or left axis deviation, conduction abnormalities, sinus bradycardia with ectopic atrial rhythm and atrial enlargement. The ambulatory ECG can show atrial and ventricular ectopics, sinus pauses, intermittent or variable atrioventricular block and non-sustained arrhythmias. The ECG findings do not correlate with prognosis.  Arrhthymias can be premature ventricular complexes, non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and supraventricular tachyarrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation develops in approximately 20% and is associated with an increased risk of fatal cardiac failure.  There is no history to suggest drug abuse, and aortic stenosis is rare in the absence of congenital or rheumatic heart disease. A myocardial infarction and massive pulmonary embolism would have given characteristic ECG changes. "
cardiovascular system,109,"A 23-year-old man with Marfan's syndrome is admitted with central chest pain radiating to his back. A differential BP in both arms is noted and a CT is performed which demonstrates a Type B aortic dissection suitable for medical management. You are asked to review him with respect to management of his BP. The highest recorded BP is 135/85mmHg, pulse is 85bpm and regular. A lab creatinine is measured at 100 µmol/l (60-110). Which of the following is the most appropriate way to manage his blood pressure?",IV labetalol,IV nitroprusside,No intervention required,Oral amlodipine,Oral lisinopril,A,"The answer is IV labetalol. Medical management is preferred for Type B aortic dissections, as early surgery has been associated with significant complications. Conventional targets for pulse and BP are less than 80bpm for pulse rate, and between 100 and 120 mmHg for systolic BP. In patients who cannot tolerate a beta blocker, a calcium channel blocker or nitrate is a reasonable alternative. IV nitroprusside is an alternative, but it doesn't reduce pulse rate, and as such IV beta blockade is preferred. Amlodipine could be used in a patient who is beta blocker intolerant but as both this and lisinopril are once daily oral medications they are more difficult to titrate in the acute setting. As this patient's BP and pulse are above the ideal target, taking no action is not the best option."
cardiovascular system,110,An 80-year-old lady is admitted on the emergency intake and is noted to have facial flushing which she says is long term and related to her andquot;heart tabletsandquot;. Which of the following is likely to be responsible for this effect?,B-Blocker,Loop diuretic,Calcium Channel Blocker,Statin,Potassium Sparing Diuretic,C,"β-blocking agents cause vasoconstriction as they allow unopposed a-activity. Drugs such as the following all produce flushing:  Calcium channel blockers Nicotinic acid Tamoxifen Morphine Luteinising hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues, and Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)."
cardiovascular system,111,"You have shown an interest in paediatric cardiology and your clinical supervisor has arranged for you to attend some clinics with the visiting paediatric cardiologist. You have a very interesting session and you were particularly interested in the patients you saw with ventricular septal defects (VSDs). After this session you have been stimulated to do some self-directed learning and want to read about VSDs. As part of your reading you learn about the anatomical classification of VSDs and the frequency of each type. During your reading, what did you discover to be the most common site for a VSD?",Muscular - inlet,Muscular - outlet,Muscular - trabecular,Perimembranous,None of the above,D,"There are a number of different classifications for VSDs. One easy way to group these is based on the division of the ventricular septum into membranous and muscular portions. Muscular inlet, outlet, and trabecular are the subdivision of the muscular VSDs and occur in 5%, 5-10% and 5-10% respectively. Perimembranous VSDs account for 70-80% of VSDs and are situated between the inlet and outlet portions of the septum."
cardiovascular system,112,A 56 year old male who has had an MI previously now presents with SOB and peripheral oedema and is found to be in heart failure.  A beta blocker has been commenced.  What beta blocker is the most appropriate in heart failure?,Atenolol,Propranolol,Bisoprolol,Metoprolol,Sotalol,C,Evidence shows that bisoprolol and carvedilol reduce mortality in heart failure.
cardiovascular system,113,A 65-year-old man presents with dyspnea 3 days after an MI. On auscultation he has a pansystolic murmur at the apex radiating to the axilla. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Ruptured papillary muscle,Ventricular aneurysm,Pericarditis,Pericardial effusion,VSD,A,Pansystolic murmur in apex radiating to axilla may be due to mitral regurgitation secondary to papillary muscle rupture
cardiovascular system,114,A 70 year old man with mitral stenosis requires removal of 3 teeth.  he is penicillin allergic.  What antibiotic prophylaxsis would you prescribe?,Metronidazole 1 hour before,None,Co amoxiclav 1 hour before,Vancomycin 1 hour before,Amoxicillin 1 hour before,B,There is no evidence for antibiotic prophylaxis and thus it is no longer recommended.
cardiovascular system,115,Which of the following is correct concerning a precordial thump?,Can be delivered up to twice during a cardiac arrest,Can be given following an unwitnessed cardiac arrest,Is more successful with pulseless VT than VF,Should be administered after a warning has been given to the patient,Should be aimed at the position of V4 on the anterior chest wall,C,"Guidelines from the Resuscitation Council (UK) state that if a patient has a monitored and witnessed VF/VT arrest in hospital, a single shock should be given. Chest compressions should be started immediately after, with a compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2 for 2 minutes. Three quick successive (stacked) shocks are no longer recommended, unless the arrest occurs in the immediate post-operative period following cardiac surgery or when the patient is already attached to a manual defibrillator. A precordial thump can be successful if given within seconds of the onset of a shockable rhythm. Delivery should not delay calling for help, or accessing a defibrillator, but would be indicated here whilst awaiting the defibrillator. Chest compressions should start immediately if it is unsuccessful. Only one thump should be delivered over the lower third of the sternum. The ulnar edge of a tightly clenched fist is used to deliver a sharp impact from a height of about 20 cm, then retract immediately (thereby creating an impulse-like stimulus). Repeating a precordial thump is not recommended. Warning a patient who has arrested will serve little purpose. It is important to remember that a precordial thump has a very low success rate for cardioversion. In general it delivers approximately 7-10 joules of energy, but this is operator dependent and references vary to this regard. There is more success with pulseless VT than with VF. "
cardiovascular system,116,"A 67-year-old man presents with reduced exercise tolerance. He has a past medical history of an aortic valve replacement. On examination there is an ejection systolic murmur heard loudest in the aortic area, along with a high pitched early diastolic sound. The JVP rises on inspiration, and is associated with a rapid descent. Which of the following is the likely cause?",Aortic regurgitation,Aortic stenosis,Bacterial endocarditis,Constrictive pericarditis,Superior vena cava obstruction,D,"Constrictive pericarditis is often associated with previous cardiac surgery. Other common features in the past medical history include previous pericarditis, radiotherapy, or connective tissue disease. These risk factors are all postulated to result in inflammation of the pericardium, and resultant fibrosis and constriction. Common clinical features include Kussmaul's sign (raised JVP on inspiration) and a pericardial knock. The ejection systolic murmur heard in this case is a flow murmur from the previous aortic valve replacement. Aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, or bacterial endocarditis would not explain the JVP rising on inspiration, its rapid descent or the high pitched early diastolic sound. Superior vena cava obstruction tends to present with shortness of breath, facial oedema, headache and venous distension in the upper limbs, chest, and neck. Constrictive pericarditis can be a difficult diagnosis to make, and even echocardiography is not always suggestive. "
cardiovascular system,117,How is Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy inherited?,Autosomal recessive,Autosomal dominant,Mitochondrial,X linked dominant,X linked recessive,B,HOCM is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.  About 45% are due to mutations in the β myosin heavy chain gene on chromosome 14 q11.2-3.
cardiovascular system,118,An 18-year-old with cerebral palsy is admitted after a respiratory arrest having been intubated by paramedics. Nobody can gain intravenous access as the patient is too shut down. A femoral line is not possible due to contractures. You do not have the experience to perform central venous cannulation. Which of the following is the best option for administering intravenous fluids/emergency drugs in this situation of inability to gain venous access?,Down the endotracheal tube,Intramuscular,Intraosseous,Nasogastric,Subcutaneous,C,"Nasogastric, intramuscular and subcutaneous are too slow and unreliable for emergency situations (although in cardiac arrest the endotracheal route is recognised). Venous cut down is a possibility but requires skill in the procedure. Intraosseous is still perfectly viable in the adult patient 2 cm below the tibial tuberosity on the antero-medial side or 2 cm proximal to the medial malleolus."
cardiovascular system,119,"A 32-year-old woman presents to the clinic with symptoms of pneumonia and you suspect she has an underlying Mycoplasma infection. On examination she is pyrexial, 38.2°C, her BP is 110/70 mmHg and her pulse is 90. She looks pale and has signs of a right sided pneumonia. You suspect that she may have haemolytic anaemia. Which of the following would you expect to find on laboratory testing?",Decreased LDH,Decreased reticulocyte count,Increase in bilirubin (predominantly conjugated),Increased haptoglobin,Presence of spherocytes on the blood film,E,Presence of spherocytes or fragmented red blood cells on the film is suggestive of haemolytic anaemia. In mycoplasma infection spherocytes are a result of cold agglutinin damage to the red cell membrane. Nucleated red cells may also be seen. Reticulocyte counts are of course increased in haemolytic anaemia due to increased circulating immature red blood cells. The increase in bilirubin is predominantly unconjugated. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is increased and haptoglobins are reduced. Urinary urobilinogen is increased and haemosiderinuria may be seen.
cardiovascular system,120,"A 30-year-old pregnant patient is referred to the cardiology clinic with a history of regular fast palpitations. The gestational age is 27 weeks. There is no history of collapse and the patient is usually fit and well. You examine the patient. Pulse is 105 and regular and the blood pressure is 105/80 mmHg. Venous pressure is not elevated. Heart sounds are normal and a resting 12 lead ECG shows sinus rhythm only. Regarding the normal pregnancy, which from the list below is an expected physiological change?",Bradycardia,Elevated JVP,Hypertension,Reduced stroke volume,Tachycardia,E,"There are a number of physiological changes which occur during pregnancy. The heart rate increases by 10-20 bpm, stroke volume and cardiac output increase but venous pressure should remain the same due to a 25% reduction in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance. Blood pressure should drop in the first and second trimester and then climb to pre-pregnancy levels by the third trimester."
cardiovascular system,121,Which of the following is associated with Marfan's syndrome?,Autosomal recessive inheritance,Cognitive impairment,Increased upper:lower body ratio,Pulmonary stenosis,Retinal detachment,E,"Marfan's syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition associated with ocular abnormalities such as upwards lens dislocation and retinal detachment^1. It is associated with a number of other ocular abnormalities, including:  myopia increased axial globe length corneal flatness subluxation of the lenses (ectopia lentis) early glaucoma, and early cataracts.  About 6 out of 10 people with Marfan's syndrome have dislocated lenses in one or both eyes. Aortic regurgitation (not pulmonary stenosis) may be a finding and aneurysmal dilatation is a feature. Other associated cardiovascular respiratory complications include:  mitral valve prolapse aortic aneurysms cardiac conduction defects emphysema pneumothorax, and kyphoscoliosis.  Upper to lower body ratio (head to symphysis pubis:symphysis pubis to toes) is decreased in Marfan's syndrome. Other common physical traits include:  long arms, legs, and fingers tall and thin body type scoliosis pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum flexible joints flat feet, and crowded teeth.  "
cardiovascular system,122,"A 53-year-old had a dental extraction after which he recently had a mitral valve prolapse, high temp of 39C, cardiac failure and new cardiac murmur. What is the single most likely diagnosis?",Atheroma,Congenital,Regeneration,Infection,Neoplastic,D,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is defined as an infection of the endocardial surface of the heart which may include one or more heart valves, the mural endocardium, or a septal defect. Its intracardiac effects include severe valvular insufficiency, which may lead to intractable congestive heart failure and myocardial abscesses. If left untreated, IE is almost inevitably fatal. Dental extraction is a risk factor for infective endocarditis"
cardiovascular system,123,A previous fit and healthy 45 year old gentleman presents to A and E after sudden onset of palpitations following a night out.  When you examine the patient you find his pulse to be 140 bpm and irregular.  His blood pressure is 130/80mmHg and his heart sounds are normal and chest is clear.  An ECG confirms your suspicion of Atrial Fibrillation.  What drug should be used for chemical cardioversion?,Atenolol,Flecainide,Amiodarone,Digoxin,Adenosine,B,"Chemical Cardioversion is achieved by flecainide and amiodarone.  Flecainide should not be used where there is structural heart disease. In those with a history of IHD, amiodarone should be utilised.  Adenosine is used for SVT. Digoxin is used for rate control not rhythm control."
cardiovascular system,124,Which physiological change will directly contribute to increased Mean arterial pulse pressure?,High aortic compliance,Low aortic compliance,Reduced peripheral resistance,Reduced stroke volume,Reduced venous return,B,"Pulse pressure is the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressure. If the aorta is less compliant (stiffer and less able to contract), there will be a higher systolic pressure and therefore increased pulse pressure.  Reduced stroke volume, high aortic compliance, reduced venous return, and reduced peripheral resistance all result in reduced pulse pressure."
cardiovascular system,125,You are called to an arrest situation where the patient is noted to have pulseless electrical activity (PEA). Which one of the following is a potential cause?,100 mg of atenolol taken orally,A core body temperature of 36°C,An apical pneumothorax of 20% volume,Hypokalaemia,Type II respiratory failure,D,"Pulseless electrical activity (PEA) has numerous causes that can be summarised into the four Hs and four Ts. These are:  Hypoxia Hypovolaemia Hypothermia, and Hyper/hypokalaemia  and:  Tension pneumothorax Cardiac tamponade Thromboembolism, and Toxic/therapeutic disorders.  Hypothermia is defined as a core temperature below 35°C. A small pneumothorax is unlikely to cause hypoxaemia at sea level, unless it becomes a tension pneumothorax. Atenolol is used in the management of hypertension and angina, and is frequently prescribed in doses up to 100 mg daily, which does not constitute an overdose. A low serum potassium is a recognised cause of PEA."
cardiovascular system,126,Which of the following electrocardiogram (ECG) changes is associated with a suspected myocardial infarction?,"In a subendocardial MI, S-T elevation and T wave inversion occurs in leads facing the infarcted area",Myocardial infarction cannot be diagnosed in the presence of right bundle branch block,Myocardial infarction causes 'convex downwards' S-T segments,Right ventricular infarction cannot be diagnosed using a standard 12 lead ECG,"True posterior left ventricular infarction is characterised by pathological Q waves, tall R waves and inverted T waves in V1 and V2",D,"The usual ECG changes following an acute myocardial infarction include S-T elevation greater than 1 mm (convex upwards, concave downwards) developing within the first few hours. Tall peaked T waves may also be seen in the acute stages. Pathological Q waves (representing transmural infarction), a reduction in R wave height and deeply inverted T waves (in the leads facing the infarcted muscle) may develop over the next 72 hours. The absence of Q waves implies partial-thickness infarction. A subendocardial MI is associated with flat S-T depression (not elevation) and T wave inversion in leads facing the infarction. The S-T segment changes following a myocardial infarct usually resolve within days. The T wave changes often persist for weeks but may be permanent. The Q waves are usually, but not always permanent. It is possible to diagnose an acute MI in the presence of right bundle branch block and also in left bundle branch block when using non-standard ECG criteria. True posterior left ventricular infarction is characterised by tall R waves, S-T depression and peaked upright (not inverted) T waves in leads V1 and V2. Right ventricular infarction does not produce a specific pattern in the standard 12 lead ECG, so the use of right-sided precordial leads (V4R - V6R) is required."
cardiovascular system,127,"A 35 year old female presents with shortness of breath on exertion, fatigue and syncope. On examination there is a continuous machinery murmur best heard under the left clavicle. Her pulse is bounding. A CXR is consistent with pulmonary oedema and there is evidence of LVH on ECG. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Ventricular septal defect,Patent ductus arteriosus,Mitral regurgitation,Aortic stenosis,Coarctation of the aorta,B,The clinical features here are classical of a patent ductus arteriosus. This can present at any age. The ductus arteriosus in foetal life connects the pulmonary artery to the aorta and directs blood flow from the lungs. If the ductus arteriosus remains open there is a left to right shunt and pulmonary flow is excessive. There is increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium and increased left ventricular volume. This can therefore lead to heart failure or pulmonary hypertension and eisenmenger's syndrome. It typically leads to a continuous machinery murmur with bounding pulses due to the increased left heart blood flow and low diastolic pressure in the systemic system due to flow from aorta to pulmonary artery.
cardiovascular system,128,A 60-year-old woman is admitted with sudden onset of chest pain and is diagnosed with an acute myocardial infarction. Her acute illness is complicated by low blood pressure and poor tissue perfusion for several days. Her serum lactate becomes elevated. Her serum urea and creatinine are noted to be increasing.      Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Normal Range   Urea (mmol/L) 8 22 30 2.5-7.5 mmol/L   Creatinine (µmol/L) 116 140 200 60-110 µmol/L    Granular and hyaline casts are present on microscopic urinalysis. Which renal lesion is most likely to be present in this situation?,Acute tubular necrosis,Minimal change disease,Nodular glomerulosclerosis,Pyelonephritis,Renal vein thrombosis,A,"Ischaemia, typically in hypotensive hospitalised patients, is the most frequent antecedent to acute tubular necrosis. Blood pressure should be maintained in cardiogenic shock with fluids and/or inotropic agents."
cardiovascular system,129,"A 70-year-old male is referred by his GP for management of recently diagnosed congestive heart failure. The patient has a history of poorly controlled hypertension. Over the last three months he has been aware of deteriorating shortness of breath, fatigue, and orthopnea. Over the last month he had been commenced on digoxin (62.5 µg daily), furosemide (80 mg daily), and amiloride 10 mg. On examination he has a pulse of 96 bpm regular, a blood pressure of 132/88 mmHg. His JVP was not raised, he had some scattered bibasal crackles on auscultation with a displaced apex beat in the anterior axillary line, sixth intercostal space. Auscultation of the heart revealed no murmurs and he had peripheral oedema to the mid tibia. Investigations showed:    Serum sodium 144 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 3.5 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 13 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 135 μmol/L (60-110)   Serum digoxin 1.0 ng/mL (1.0-2.0)    One month previously his urea had been 11 mmol/L and creatinine 110 mol/L. An ECG reveals left ventricular hypertrophy and chest x ray shows cardiomegaly and calcified aorta. Which is the most appropriate next step in management?",Add an ACE inhibitor to the current regimen,Add atenolol at a dose of 25 mg daily,Increase digoxin to 0.25 mg daily,Increase furosemide to 80 mg twice daily,Maintain on current therapy.,A,"This patient would be classified as probably NYHA grade III - IV heart failure (dyspnoeic on minimal exertion - rest). With the persisting symptoms despite 80 mg of furosemide, guidelines would initially suggest the addition of an ACE inhibitor. Although there has been a mild decline in his urea and electrolytes since the introduction of therapy this would not be a contraindication to the use of ACEis. There is no evidence that increasing a dose of digoxin above 62.5 µg in a patient in sinus rhythm would have any added benefit. Although beta blockers would be of further benefit in this patient, it is important first to establish him on ACEi and then introduce beta blockers such as carvedilol, metoprolol, or bisoprolol in a small dose and gradually increase."
cardiovascular system,130,A 81 year old male with a history of hypertension and inferior MI is seen in the cardiology clinic due to worsening angina and heart failure and 2 syncopal episodes.  He is found to have an ejection systolic murmur loudest at the apex. Which investigation will confirm the most likely diagnosis?,Blood cultures,ECG,Exercise tolerance test,Echocardiography,Coronary angiography,D,Aortic Stenosis explains all of the symptoms of worsening angina and heart failure and the 2 episodes of syncope.  Although the murmur is loudest at the apex mitral regurgitation is less likely to explain the syncopal episodes.An Echocardiograph will confirm the diagnosis. Coronary angiography should be performed but is not used for the diagnosis.
cardiovascular system,131,A patient presents with compensated cardiac failure. Which of the following medications is commenced initially and will most likely improve symptoms and prognosis?,Furosemide,Ramipril,Amlodipine,Spironolactone,Digoxin,B,ACE inhibitors are commenced as not only do they improve symptoms but reduces remodelling of the heart and improves survival.
cardiovascular system,132,An 18-year-old man had repeated episodes of breathlessness and palpitations lasting about 20 minutes and resolving gradually. There were no abnormal physical signs. What is the most likely cause of these features?,Drug abuse,Panic attacks,Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia,Personality disorder,Thyrotoxicosis,B,"Drug abuse is unlikely, since the symptoms are quite short lived. We would expect other symptoms such as GI disturbance, headaches or hypertension to accompany a variety of drug abuse causes. Paroxysmal SVT would start and stop suddenly, not gradually. Personality disorder and thyrotoxicosis would both be expected to lead to symptoms of longer duration with other associated symptoms. This leaves 'panic disorder' as the most likely diagnosis."
cardiovascular system,133,A 51-year-old man had an MI a few days ago. He developed breathlessness. Echo was done and showed a pansystolic murmur. What can be the cause of this symptom?,Ruptured papillary muscle,Acute pericarditis,Dresslers syndrome,Malignant VT,Ventricular aneurysm,A,Papillary muscle rupture causes mitral regurgitation causing pancystolic murmur leading to features of heart failure like breathlessness
cardiovascular system,134,"A 51-year-old man with type 2 diabetes and no previous history of CHD presents at annual review. Currently he is taking metformin 500 mg bd, aspirin 75 mg od, perindopril 4 mg od, and simvastatin 20 mg od. On examination, his blood pressure is 140/72 mmHg, he has background diabetic retinopathy and has a peripheral sensory neuropathy to light touch in the feet. Investigations reveal:    HbA1C 7.1% (3.8-6.4)   54 mmol/mol (18-46)   Total cholesterol 3.9 mmol/L (less than5.2)   Triglyceride 2.5 mmol/L (0.45-1.69)   HDL-cholesterol 0.8 mmol/L (greater than1.55)   LDL-cholesterol 2.1 mmol/L (less than3.36)    Which treatment option will further improve this patient's dyslipidaemia?",Cholestyramine,Ezetimibe,Fenofibrate,No other treatment required,Rosuvastatin,C,"This patient's TC and LDL-C are at the currently advocated target levels. Patients with T2DM commonly have low HDL-C and elevated triglycerides (TG). In some patients, TG may improve with stricter glycaemic control. The role of HDL-C and triglycerides in cardiovascular risk remains unclear. Some authorities advocate desirable HDL-C levels greater than 1 mmol/L and plasma TG less than 1.7 mmol/L in subjects at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The FIELD study assessed the effects of fenofibrate therapy on CV mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. Although the primary end point of CV mortality was not achieved, partly due to high use of non-study lipid lowering therapies (statin use was much higher in placebo group 34% versus 18% in fenofibrate), the composite endpoint of major CVD events was significantly reduced with fenofibrate. Furthermore, at any given LDL or TC level, reduced HDL-C is associated with an increased CHD risk. Fenofibrate increases HDL-C by 10-15% and reduces plasma TG by 15-20%. Concomitant fibrate-statin use is associated with an increased risk of myopathy so evaluation of combination therapy for safety and tolerability is important. When evaluating a patient with hypertriglyceridaemia, secondary causes need to be considered. These include hypothyroidism and poorly controlled diabetes as well as excess alcohol intake. "
cardiovascular system,135,A 50-year-old lady presents to emergency department with sudden severe chest pain radiating to both shoulder and accompanying SOB (shortness of breath). Examination: cold peripheries and paraparesis. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?,MI,Aortic dissection,Pulmonary embolism,Good pastures syndrome,Motor neuron disease,B,Cold peripheries due to reduced blood flow to distal parts of dissection. Paraperesis or paraplegia due to spinal cord ischemia and infarction as a presenting manifestation of aortic dissection has been found in 2 to 5 % of patients. Usual management for type A dissection is surgery and for type B is conservative
cardiovascular system,136,An ETT shows J point ST depression of approximately 1 mm. What treatment should be initiated?,Commence aspirin,Commence beta blockers,Referral for Angiography,Repeat ETT,Nil,E,J point depression is observed as a normal physiological response to elevated heart rates. There is upward sloping ST depression which is not predictive of coronary artery disease and thus no treatment is required unless there was strong clinical suspicion there was cardiac disease and further investigations would be organised.
cardiovascular system,137,A 35-year-old female presents with chest pain on exertion. On examination she has yellow discolouration of her palmar creases and a diagnosis of remnant hyperlipidaemia (type III hyperlipidaemia) is made. Which of the following is the cause of this hyperlipidaemia?,Apo CIII homozygosity,Apo E-2 homozygosity,LCAT deficiency,LDL receptor deficiency,Lipoprotein lipase deficiency,B,"Remnant hyperlipidaemia is associated with:  Hypercholesterolaemia Hypertriglyceridaemia Palmar xanthomata, and Early onset of cardiovascular disease.  The genotype of the condition is apo E-2/E-2 and occurs with a frequency of 1:100. Low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor deficiency is associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Lipoprotein lipase deficiency is rare and associated with marked hypertriglyceridaemia."

Lateral infarcts affect I, II and aVL."
cardiovascular system,139,"A 17-year-old boy was seen in the Emergency Department for worsening shortness of breath and wheeze. He has a two year history of asthma which responds to high doses of oral steroids. Further history revealed tingling and numbness affecting his toes for few months. He was given a full course of antibiotics and oral steroids by the GP but this did not help. He does not have any other comorbidities. There is no family history of note. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. His exercise tolerance has been gradually deteriorating. There is no history of foreign travel. The examination revealed pulse 104/min, BP 125/70 mmHg, respiratory rate 22/min, apyrexial, and oxygen saturations 97% on room air. There was bilateral wheeze in the chest and vesicular breath sounds. Neurological examination revealed decreased sensation in a stocking distribution. The rest of the neurological and systemic examination was normal. The initial blood results reveal:    Hb 105 g/L (130-180)   WCC 10.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Neutrophils 2.06 ×10^9/L (1.5-7.0)   Lymphocytes 1.77 ×10^9/L (1.5-4.0)   Eosinophils 4.0 ×10^9/L (0.04-0.4)   Urea 4.4 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 115 μmol/L (60-110)    Urine dipstick was positive for blood. Chest x ray was normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Atopic asthma,Atypical pneumonia,Churg-Strauss syndrome,Goodpasture's syndrome,Glomerulonephritis,C,"Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare type of vasculitis affecting small to medium sized vessels. It typically presents with asthma and high eosinophilic count. It can involve other systems, as in this question: inflammation of vasa nervosum giving rise to symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, vasculitis of renal vessels giving rise to microscopic haematuria, and mild renal impairment. Multisystem abnormality should raise the possibility of vasculitis. Regarding the options: Atopic asthma would not explain the other symptoms in the patient such as peripheral neuropathy, raised eosinophils, impaired renal functions along with microscopic haematuria. Similarly, atypical pneumonia would not explain all the symptoms. The patient has a normal CXR which would make this choice less likely. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare vasculitis. This question presents the typical picture of a patient with Churg-Strauss syndrome with asthma, mild renal impairment, microscopic haematuria, raised eosinophilic count. This vasculitis involves small to medium sized blood vessels (capillaries, venules, arterioles). The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has proposed six criteria for the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome. The presence of four or more criteria yields a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 99.7%. These criteria include:  Asthma (wheezing, expiratory rhonchi) Eosinophilia of more than 10% in peripheral blood Paranasal sinusitis Pulmonary infiltrates (may be transient) Histological proof of vasculitis with extravascular eosinophils, and Mononeuritis multiplex or polyneuropathy.  Management includes glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressant drugs (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate). Normal CXR and absence of haemoptysis are against Goodpasture's syndrome. Patients with Goodpasture's syndrome have positive anti-GBM antibodies. Evidence of microscopic haematuria does suggest underlying glomerulonephritis, but again this diagnosis alone is not sufficient to explain the whole picture."
cardiovascular system,140,"A child is brought to the Emergency Department by his parents after a three month history of blue lips and breathlessness. You arrange urgent admission and follow up the case on your next shift. You call the paediatric SHO to find out about the child. She tells you he underwent a transthoracic echocardiogram and it demonstrated displacement of the tricuspid valve towards the apex, a small 'atrialised', and hypoplastic RV and an ASD. You go to the ward to see the patient and look in his notes. You review his ECG. Based on the likely diagnosis, which ECG finding is most likely to be present?",Left axis deviation,Left bundle branch block,Right bundle branch block,Type A Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern,Type B Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern,C,"The echo findings in this child are characteristic for Ebstein's anomaly. This congenital heart defect predominantly affects the right heart and disrupts the right bundle branch, leading to a right bundle branch block pattern on ECG. Type B WPW is seen in around 15% of cases. Other ECG findings include evidence of right atrial hypertrophy."
cardiovascular system,141,"A 69-year-old woman presented with an ulcer over the left ankle, which had developed over the previous nine months. She had a history of right deep vein thrombosis (DVT) five years previously. On examination she had a superficial slough-based ulcer, 6 cm in diameter, over the medial malleolus with no evidence of cellulitis. Which investigation is needed before application of compression bandaging?",Ankle-brachial pressure index,Bacteriological swab of the ulcer,Bilateral lower limb arteriogram,Right leg venogram,Venous duplex ultrasound scan,A,"It has been reported that venous ulcerations are the most common type of ulcer affecting the lower extremities. The probable underlying cause of venous congestion, which may promote ulceration, is venous insufficiency. The treatment of venous ulceration is control of oedema, treating any infection, and compression. However, compressive dressings or devices should not be applied if the arterial circulation is impaired. It is thus important to identify any arterial disease, and ankle-brachial pressure index is a simple way of doing this. One may then progress to lower limb arteriogram if indicated. There is no clinical sign of infection, and although a bacterial swab would help to rule out pathogens within the ulcer, arterial insufficiency is the more important issue. If there is a clinical suspicion of DVT then duplex (or rarely a venogram) is indicated to decide on the indication for anticoagulation. "
cardiovascular system,142,"A 50-year-old female presents with dyspnoea, a new murmur, and fever; she is diagnosed with infective endocarditis. Which of the following is associated with the best prognosis?",Aortic valve infection,Culture negative endocarditis,Low complement levels,Staphylococcus aureus infection,Streptococcus viridans infection,E,"Features suggestive of a worse prognosis are:  acute endocarditis (Staphylococcus aureus) heart failure intravenous drug abuse (often left and right-sided disease) prosthetic valve infection infection of the aortic rather than mitral valve, and associated rhythm disturbance.  Cultures are negative in patients with IE for three major reasons: •Previous administration of antimicrobial agents •Inadequate microbiological techniques •Infection with highly fastidious bacteria or nonbacterial pathogens (eg, fungi) A noninfectious cause of endocarditis must be investigated when blood culture are negative. (Source: www.uptodate.com) Subacute bacterial endocarditis (Streptococcus viridans) has a better prognosis."
cardiovascular system,143,"A 43-year-old man is on the coronary care unit after suffering a large anterior myocardial infarction. Fortunately he recovered well following timely reperfusion treatment.

These include increasing physical activity to 20-30 minutes per day, which seems daunting to patients who may not have exercised as such since school. It advises this is increased slowly and cardiac rehabilitation classes can help promote and encourage this. Abstinence from alcohol is not recommended per se, but should be used in moderation. Smokers should be encouraged to stop, and cutting down does not work. Vitamin E and beta-carotene supplements are specifically mentioned and are not to be recommended."

cardiovascular system,146,A 29-year-old male is admitted with a one hour history of severe central chest pain associated with vomiting. It transpires that he used cocaine three hours ago. His blood pressure is 142/74 mmHg and he has a pulse of 110 beats per minute regular. His ECG reveals 3 mm ST segment elevation in leads V2-5. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for this patient?,Abciximab,Angiography +/- PTCA ,Isoket (isosorbide dinitrate) infusion,Low molecular weight heparin ,Tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA),C,"Cocaine is a drug of widespread abuse and remains one of the commonest causes of acute myocardial infarction (MI) in men below 35 years of age. The aetiology of cocaine-induced MI is thought to be related to coronary artery spasm as many patients do not have overt coronary artery disease. This vasoconstriction is thought to be more accentuated in those with pre-existing coronary artery disease or those who smoke. It is probably caused by stimulation of the α-adrenergic receptors in smooth muscle cells. In addition, cocaine increases endothelin-1 (a vasoconstrictor) and decreases nitric oxide (vasodilator). Consequently guidelines suggest the use of nitrates in the first instance coupled with calcium antagonists. Intravenous benzodiazepines are also effective in resolving chest pain and improving cardiac performance. If there is no improvement in the clinical condition, then angiography should be considered. Fibrinolytics are generally avoided. "
cardiovascular system,147,Which of the following options describes troponin?,A component of thick filaments,A component of thin filaments,A myosin heavy chain,A myosin light chain,A substance produced by pulmonary vascular endothelium,B,"Troponin is a component of thin filaments (along with actin and tropomyosin), and is the protein to which calcium binds to accomplish this regulation. Troponin has three subunits: TnC, TnI, and TnT. When calcium is bound to specific sites on TnC, the structure of the thin filament changes in such a manner that myosin (a molecular motor organised in muscle thick filaments) attaches to thin filaments and produces force and/or movement. In the absence of calcium, tropomyosin interferes with this action of myosin, and therefore muscles remain relaxed."

Which of the following conditions is most associated with a 'jerky' pulse?,Aortic stenosis,Cardiac tamponade,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,'Mixed' aortic valve disease,Severe left ventricular failure,C,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is typically associated with a jerky pulse although it may present with entirely normal clinical findings.
cardiovascular system,152,A 70-year-old male with a history of syncope and hypertension is found to have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia during telemetry. Investigations show a serum magnesium of 0.4 mmol/L (0.75-1.05). Which one of the following is most likely to be responsible for this biochemical abnormality?,Chronic renal failure,Diuretic therapy,Elevated PTH concentrations,Hyperphosphataemia,Ranitidine therapy,B,Diuretic therapy is a common cause of hypomagnesaemia due to increased renal excretion. It is not seen in hyperparathyroidism. Chronic renal failure is a cause of hypermagnesaemia. Ranitidine (unlike Proton pump inhibitors) is unlikely to cause hypomagnasemia. Hypophosphataemia is seen in association with hypomagnesaemia.
cardiovascular system,153,On physical examination a 65-year-old man is found to have pulsus alternans where there is regular alternation of the force of his radial pulse. Which of the following conditions is the most likely diagnosis?,Aortic stenosis,Cardiac tamponade,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,Mixed aortic valve disease,Severe left ventricular failure,E,Pulsus alternans is a physical finding characterised by a regular alternation of the force of the arterial pulse. It almost invariably indicates the presence of severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction. 
cardiovascular system,154,"A 24-year-old female is admitted with palpitations. Her pulse is 220 beats/min, blood pressure 70/50 mmHg and she has a respiratory rate 32/min. She is awake, alert and oriented but dyspnoeic. Her electrocardiogram shows a regular rhythm with QRS complex width of 0.11 s. What is the most appropriate therapy for this patient?",Adenosine 6 mg/6 mg/12 mg,Amiodarone 300 mg,Atenolol 50 mg,Direct current cardioversion,Verapamil 10 mg,D,"This is highly likely to be a narrow complex tachycardia. Strictly speaking, as this patient is showing signs of haemodynamic decompromise (that is, systolic blood pressure less than 90) she should be immediately DC cardioverted under sedation/anaesthesia. In practice, most people would try adenosine first whilst organising a cardioversion. "

The HACEK group and Strep. bovis are rare causes,"
cardiovascular system,156,"A 56-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with an inferior myocardial infarction. He has a history of smoking and hypertension and is a poor attendee at the GP surgery. On initial admission he is hypotensive and bradycardic, with clear inferior ST elevation. He is taken to the catheter lab and stented. You are asked to see him a few hours later as he is persistently hypotensive with poor urine output. He has remained pain free since his stenting. On examination his BP is 90/50 mmHg, his pulse is 69, he has an elevated JVP, but his chest is clear. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 140 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 6.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 188 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 5.3 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 131 μmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?",IV Dobutamine,IV Fluid loading,IV Nitrate,Rescue angioplasty,Thrombolysis,B,"This man has suffered a right ventricular infarction, leading to the classical picture of elevated JVP, no signs of left ventricular failure, and systemic hypotension. The majority of patients improve after a fluid challenge, but this should not be continued if blood pressure fails to improve, as excessive fluid loading may contribute to worsening cardiogenic shock. In patients who do not improve, monitoring of right sided pressures is the next most appropriate step, with consideration of inotropes. Most patients with right ventricular infarction improve after 48-72 hours."
cardiovascular system,157,"A 65-year-old man has long-standing stable heart failure treated with furosemide and enalapril. He complains of swelling in his left knee and his GP treats him with celecoxib, a cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor. Two weeks later the patient has increasing breathlessness and ankle oedema. Which one of the following effects of celecoxib is the most likely to explain his symptoms?",Decreased absorption of furosemide from the gut,Decreased myocardial contractility,Reduced effective action of enalapril,The onset of anaemia,The onset of fluid retention,E,"Celecoxib (rofecoxib has been withdrawn) acts by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis via inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2). It causes fluid retention and can worsen an already pre-existing heart failure as in this case. The CSM reminds prescribers that celecoxib is contraindicated in patients with severe congestive heart failure, active peptic ulceration, or gastrointestinal bleeding."
cardiovascular system,158,"A-57-year old woman who is suffering from hypertension, presented to the hospital with complaints of recurrent falls when trying to get out of bed or getting up from sitting. She is on some anti-hypertensive therapy with no other medical problems. What is the cause of her fall?",CCB,Vertibrobasiliar insufficiency,Thiazide,Hypoglycemia,Infection,C,It causes postural hypotension by volume depletion
cardiovascular system,159,Which of the following cardiac drugs shorten the QT interval?,Amiodarone,Digoxin,Moxonidine,Sodium nitroprusside,Sotalol,B,"Hypercalcaemia, hypermagnesaemia, digoxin, or thyrotoxicosis cause QT shortening. All of the other medications have no effect on QT shortening."
cardiovascular system,160,"A 44-year-old woman is taking lithium for bipolar disorder. She also suffers from hypertension and angina and recently underwent a medication review at her GP. She also suffers from osteoarthritis of her knees and has suffered a recent respiratory tract infection. Over the past few days she has become increasingly drowsy, with ataxia, dizziness and slurred speech. A lithium level is measured at 4 mmol/l. Which of the following is most likely to have resulted in her presentation with lithium toxicity?",Amoxicillin,Atenolol,Paracetamol,Ramipril,Verapamil,D,"ACE inhibitors are known to increase serum lithium levels, as are dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. Atenolol, in contrast, is a relatively safer option for the treatment of hypertension in association with long term lithium use. Verapamil in combination with lithium leads to neurotoxicity; this is independent of any increase in serum lithium levels. If patients have poorly controlled hypertension and they are taking lithium, it may be better to discuss the case with the psychiatrist to see if they can be changed to another mood stabilising agent, such as sodium valproate."
cardiovascular system,161,"A 13-year-old female presents following a sore throat with chest pain, fever, and a skin rash. Examination reveals a diastolic murmur. Her ASO titre is elevated.

cardiovascular system,163,"A 36-year-old patient with hypertension presents following an unplanned pregnancy. Her blood pressure has been modestly controlled on amlodipine 5 mg and ramipril 2.5 mg over the past five years, with the diagnosis of essential hypertension following a thorough screen for secondary causes. She wishes to proceed with the pregnancy. Her current blood pressure is 135/85 mmHg. Which is next step you would take?",24 hour urine collection for protein,ECG to screen for evidence of end organ damage,Stop amlodipine,Stop ramipril,Switch to methyldopa,D,"Ramipril, other ACE inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers have an increased risk of congenital abnormalities in pregnancy. The priority is to stop either of these drugs early in pregnancy, overriding any need to screen for end organ damage with an ECG. Little information is available on the effects of amlodipine on the fetus, and its use may continue if the blood pressure mandates it. Methyldopa is a drug used in pre-eclampsia. Proteinuria is an important finding in pregnancy, though the screening tool of urine dipstick is often followed by a urinary protein/creatinine ratio rather than a formal 24 hour collection. Target blood pressure in chronic maternal hypertension is 135/85. "
cardiovascular system,164,A 23-year-old patient on regular haemodialysis was admitted to the hospital after exertional dyspnoea and atrial fibrillation. A troponin T laboratory request was made. Which of the following opinions would you formulate?,A rise in cardiac troponin compared with previous one would support the presence of myocardial ischaemia,"Any troponin level identifies a patient at greater risk of death compared with a patient without elevated troponin, but this observation does not hold in dialysis population",Cardiac troponin test has no diagnostic role in patients undergoing dialysis; it should not be requested,He is too young to have cardiovascular disease; troponin test can be omitted,None of the above,A,"The pre-test probability of cardiovascular disease is high in dialysis patients, but the cardiac troponin biomarker should be interpreted in the context of the clinical history and examination for any dialysis patient. The cardiac troponin tests are frequently elevated in asymptomatic patients undergoing dialysis. In dialysis patients with acute cardiac symptoms, a rising trend in troponin should still suggest significant myocardial ischaemia. The suggestion that the patient is too young to have cardiovascular disease is incorrect because dialysis patients have exceptionally high risk of cardiovascular disease burden. A minor issue is that the effect of haemodialysis on cardiac troponin levels remains controversial. By convention, the troponin is best measured on a pre-dialysis blood sample (unless clinical symptoms dictate otherwise)."

cardiovascular system,166,A patient is admitted on your ward with endocarditis and is prescribed vancomycin IV. You monitor the patient for signs of toxicity as it has a narrow therapeutic index. Which of the following is a result of vancomycin toxicity?,Bradycardia,Dry mouth,Erythema multiforme,Hepatoxicity,Ototoxicity,E,"Ototoxicity is associated with vancomycin, and is more likely in patients with high plasma concentrations, renal impairment or pre-existing hearing loss. It may progress after drug withdrawal, and may be irreversible. Hearing loss may be preceded by tinnitus, which must be regarded as a sign to stop treatment. The important level to measure here is the trough level as opposed to the peak level with gentamicin."

Examination reveals a goitre and a degree of exophthalmos. During physical examination she fell unconscious. Blood pressure was 70/40 mmHg. Electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response. Which of the following is the appropriate immediate management?,Anticoagulation,Carbimazole,DC cardioversion,Intravenous amiodarone,Intravenous propanolol,C,"The patient is haemodynamically compromised due to AF. The emergency management is DC cardioversion 200J → 360J → 360J. Adverse signs necessitating DC cardioversion are:  Blood pressure (BP) ≤90 mmHg Chest pain Heart failure Impaired consciousness, and Heart rate ≥ 200 bpm."
cardiovascular system,168,"A 26-year-old man is noted to have cyanosis of the lower limbs and clubbing of the toes, but not the fingers. Which of the following statements is true?",He has coarctation of the aorta,He has Eisenmenger's syndrome,He has had a Blalock shunt operation,He is likely to have a loud continuous 'machinery' murmur below the left clavicle,He is likely to need urgent surgery,B,"This is the differential cyanosis of a reversed patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). There is a right-left shunt from the pulmonary artery to the aorta just distal to the left subclavian artery. Coarctation causes radiofemoral delay. It may be associated with PDA but there is no suggestion in this patient. Continuous machinery murmur is the classic murmur of PDA, but when the shunt reverses (as in patients with a large PDA and/or pulmonary disease) the murmur becomes softer and shorter. When Eisenmenger's syndrome has developed, surgery is associated with a very high mortality. A Blalock shunt (anastomosis of subclavian artery to pulmonary artery) used to be performed for Fallot's tetralogy and leads to a weak left radial pulse."

He re-attends complaining of various muscle aches and pains and you find that his liver function tests are elevated from baseline. Pre-treatment ALT was 55 IU/L. Now his ALT is 90 IU/L. He asks whether his statin should be changed or stopped. Which of the following is the most appropriate next strategy to treat his hypercholesterolaemia?",Atorvastatin 40 mg daily,Bezafibrate,Ezetimibe,No change required,Simvastatin 20 mg daily,A,"This patient has ischaemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus and should be receiving a statin as his cholesterol is also elevated. NICE guidance currently recommends starting high-dose statins in patients with type 2 diabetes and established cardiovascular disease. However he has been intolerant of atorvastatin at its maximum dose with myalgia and raised liver function tests. His LFTs are raised but less that twice the upper limit of normal. The options are to reduce the dose or consider an alternative statin. NICE advises reducing the dose in the first instance. FIbrates and ezetimibe are generally not recommended in patients with type 2 diabetes. NICE suggests referral to a specialist if statins are completely not tolerated. Myalgia is a side effect of all statins but the incidence is probably less with rosuvastatin and pravastatin. Starting at a low dose and gradually titrating up can also minimise the risk of side effects: for example, start at 5 mg of rosuvastatin. If starting another statin, cautious monitoring of LFTs should be performed. If there is a history of statin-related hepatitis or rhabdomyolysis, statins should generally be avoided in the future if possible. "

She is in the third trimester of her first pregnancy and she has been 'taking it easy' by resting a lot at home. In the department she develops a right hemiparesis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cardiac abnormality?,Patent ductus arteriosus,Patent foramen ovale,Primum atrial septal defect,Secundum atrial septal defect,Ventricular septal defect,B,"This is a 'paradoxical embolus' where a right sided thrombus has crossed into the arterial circulation. The commonest cause is a patent foramen ovale. Although atrial septal defects are also a cause, they are more rare."
cardiovascular system,172,"Following a lecture on cardiac physiology, your consultant asks you during a ward round to calculate how much blood (in ml) Mr. Smith's ventricle ejects every time his heart beats. He gives you the following values:  Blood pressure: 136/90 mmHg units Cardiac output: 5000 ml/minute Heart Rate: 72/minute Urine output: 5 ml/kg/hr ",5ml,20ml,50ml,70ml,130ml,D,"Cardiac output (CO), or the volume of blood being pumped by the heart in one minute, is essential for normal function. It is a reflection of how well the rest of the body is being perfused, and therefore how well the body can work (perfusion enables energy production). It is multifactorial, and these can be calculated using stroke volume (SV) and heart rate (HR):  CO = HR × SV  If 5000 ml is pumped in one minute, with 72 beats of the heart, each beat will pump around 5000/72 = 69.4 ml. This relationship can be seen at all times: indeed, when one of the parameters in the equation changes, the others change accordingly, to maintain the CO within a tight range. In this situation, the blood pressure, and urine output were both useless information, as all that was needed was the cardiac output (which in a normal adult ranges from 5-8 L/min), and the heart rate."
cardiovascular system,173,A 70-year-old man is admitted to the cardiology ward with a diagnosis of Streptococcus bovis infective endocarditis. Which of the following investigations would be indicated?,Colonoscopy,Cystoscopy,Lymph node biopsy,Sialogram,Thoracoscopy,A,The association between Streptococcus bovis bacteraemia and colonic neoplasia is well described^1. The consensus of opinion is that all subjects should undergo evaluation including investigation of the gastrointestinal tract. If investigation is clear then further tests should be performed only where there are symptoms or signs to suggest malignancy in other areas.

cardiovascular system,176,"An elderly man with a history of asthma, congestive heart failure, and peptic ulcer disease is admitted with bronchospasm and rapid atrial fibrillation. He is given nebulised salbutamol frequently, a loading dose of oral digoxin, and oral prednisolone. His regular medications are continued. 24 hours after admission his plasma potassium is noted to be 2.8 mmol/l. Which of his medications is most likely to have caused this abnormality?",ACE inhibitor,Digoxin,Ranitidine,Salbutamol,Spironolactone,D,High doses of parenteral and nebulised salbutamol are associated with hypokalaemia. This effect may have been potentiated by concomitant treatment with prednisolone. Spironolactone and ACE inhibitors commonly cause hyperkalaemia (their use in combination is potentially dangerous and requires regular monitoring of serum electrolytes). Electrolyte disturbance with ranitidine is unlikely. Digoxin does not cause hypokalaemia (unless due to vomiting associated with digoxin toxicity). Hypokalaemia increases cardiac sensitivity to digoxin and predisposes the patient to digoxin toxicity; correction of hypokalaemia is recommended to avoid arrhythmias.
cardiovascular system,177,A 50-year-old female had swelling in her ankles. She is a known alcoholic. Now she presented with breathlessness and palpitations. What is the most likely cause of her condition?,VT,SVT,A-flutter,A-fib,V-ectopics,D,Ankle swelling suggests alcoholic cardiomyopathy and alcoholism is also a well known cause of atrial fibrillation

cardiovascular system,179,A 58-year-old male is admitted with a blood pressure of 210/120 mmHg and episodic runs of ventricular tachycardia (VT). Investigations confirm the presence of a right adrenal phaeochromocytoma. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial therapy?,Amiodarone,Atenolol,Lidocaine,Phenoxybenzamine,Propafenone,D,This patient has catecholamine induced severe hypertension and associated paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia. The patient should initially be alpha-blocked with phenoxybenzamine and then beta blockers introduced. This should control the runs of VT but for sustained VT lidocaine can be acutely used. 
cardiovascular system,180,Which of the following is true when measuring the blood pressure with a sphygmomanometer?,A cuff that is too small for the arm will give an underestimate of actual blood pressure,Finger sphygmomanometers provide accurate blood pressure recordings,Positioning the cuff at the wrist gives an appropriate recording,The arm should be positioned at the level of the heart for an accurate reading,The pressure should be reduced at 20 mmHg per second for appropriate recordings,D,The standard measurement of blood pressure depends upon positioning a suitably sized cuff over the upper arm with the arrow 2 cm above the brachial artery. The pressure should be reduced at 2 mmHg per second for appropriate recordings. The arm must be positioned at the level of the heart and the patient must be in a relaxed environment. The mean of three readings should be taken. An undersized cuff gives an overestimate of blood pressure and vice versa for an oversized cuff.

Continue with existing antihypertensive treatment if safe in pregnancy, or switch to an alternative treatment, unless sustained systolic blood pressure is less than 110 mmHg, sustained diastolic blood pressure is less than 70 mmHg, or the woman has symptomatic hypotension Offer antihypertensive treatment to pregnant women who have chronic hypertension and who are not already on treatment if they have a sustained systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg or higher or sustained diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg or higher. In patients with longstanding hypertension aggressive blood pressure control may compromise placental function, so diastolic blood pressure should be preserved above 80 mmHg. Any increase in blood pressure above baseline should prompt a search for new pre-eclampsia, testing full blood count, renal and liver function, urinary protein:creatinine ratio, and observing blood pressure closely.

cardiovascular system,183,"A 50-year-old male is admitted with a three hour history of central chest pain, sweating, and nausea. He has no relevant past medical history although his father died of an MI at the age of 48 and he is a smoker of five cigarettes per day. He currently takes no medication. He is seen in the morning on the consultant ward round 12 hours after symptoms onset and his pain has now settled. Examination reveals no specific abnormality and his ECG is normal. Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate at this point for this patient?",Coronary angiography,Echocardiography,Endoscopy,Exercise ECG,Troponin T,E,"This question tests your knowledge of the initial management and investigation of chest pain, which is something you will need to be fully aware of for the exam and clinical practice. This gentleman has a number of risk factors for acute coronary syndrome: he is a smoker and has a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The history he gives would be consistent with cardiac chest pain. As you will all know, acute coronary syndrome and angina have a poor prognosis and it is therefore important to diagnose it accurately and in a prompt fashion. It is important to distinguish between suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stable angina as the management differs markedly. 'Acute coronary syndrome' includes unstable angina, ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Symptoms which may indicate ACS include:  Pain in the chest and/or other areas (e.g. arms, back, or jaw) lasting longer than 15 minutes Chest pain associated with nausea and vomiting, marked sweating, breathlessness, haemodynamic instability, or particularly a combination of these New onset chest pain, or abrupt deterioration in previously stable angina, with recurrent chest pain occurring frequently and with little or no exertion, and with episodes often lasting longer than 15 minutes.  Response to glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) should not be used to make the diagnosis. Symptoms do not present differently between sexes, or ethnic groups. Patients who present with acute chest pain should have a 12-lead ECG as soon as possible. A normal ECG does not exclude acute coronary syndrome. If the resting 12-lead ECG shows regional ST-segment elevation or presumed new left bundle block, local protocols should be followed, which will often be to send these patients for immediate primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients whose ECG shows regional ST-segment depression, deep T-wave inversion, or Q waves (known or presumed to be new) suggestive of an NSTEMI or unstable angina should be treated as acute coronary syndrome immediately and a 12 hour troponin carried out for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. If the resting 12-lead ECG is normal ACS should not be excluded. Serial resting ECGs should be taken and any new changes acted upon. Management of ACS should be started as soon as suspected. Pain relief should be given in the form of GTN (sublingual or buccal) and/or intravenous opioids. 300 mg aspirin should be given to all, unless there is clear evidence of an allergy. Other antiplatelet agents are given dependent on local policy, and the presence of ECG changes. Supplemental oxygen should only be given to those with saturations of less than 94%, who are not at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure (target saturations 94-98%, 88-92% in those with COPD who are at risk of hypercapnic respiratory failure). Full bloods should be done on admission to hospital, including a baseline troponin (I or T). This troponin is not used immediately for interpretation of the cause of chest pain, but can be used to show a rise in patients who have an elevated baseline troponin (for example those with renal impairment). A second blood sample is taken for troponin I or T 10-12 hours after the onset of symptoms. A myocardial infarct can be diagnosed when there is a rise and/or fall of troponin (with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit) together with evidence of myocardial ischaemia (symptoms, new ST changes/LBBB/new Q waves, imaging demonstrating new loss of myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality). You should be aware that there are other causes of raised troponin, including myositis, aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Patients who give a good history for cardiac chest pain, but their troponin is negative, should be investigated for stable chest pain. It is in these patients where an exercise test is useful to determine the presence of ischaemia on exertion. Cardiac angiography is indicated in those patients who have a positive exercise test, or who have had a NSTEMI, or unstable angina. The timing is determined by individual risk factors, but a troponin is always determined prior to considering angiography (except of course with STEMIs). "

cardiovascular system,185,An elderly lady is admitted to the Emergency Department with an episode of syncope. She has a history of high blood pressure on bendroflumethiazide. On examination her GCS is 15/15. Blood pressure is 135/78 mmHg. Pulse is 60 regular. Cardiovascular and respiratory examination is normal. A focussed neurological examination is also normal. A 12 lead ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm with a normal axis. The corrected QT interval is 540 ms. You are concerned this patient has had a ventricular arrhythmia leading to syncope. You send bloods urgently for electrolyte estimation. Which of the following biochemical abnormalities can lead to this problem?,Hypercalcaemia,Hyperkalaemia,Hypoglycaemia,Hypomagnesaemia,Low TSH,D,"This question is about acquired long QT syndrome. Long QT can lead to torsades de pointes and syncope and sudden death. Long QT can be classified as either congenital or acquired. There are a huge number of acquired causes including drug, biochemical and metabolic causes. Common biochemical abnormalities include hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, and hypomagnesaemia. Hypoglycaemia is not a cause. Hypothyroidism (and therefore high TSH) can lead to long QT via severe bradycardia."
cardiovascular system,186,A 40 year old male presents with painful fingers.  On examination there is evidence of dactylitis and he is tender over his DIPs and pitting of his nails.  His rheumatoid factor is negative.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Rheumatoid arthritis,Psoriatic arthritis,Pseudogout,Osteoarthritis,SLE,B,The most likely diagnosis is psoritic arthritis which can present like RA but more commonly leads to dactylitis and affect the DIPs rather than PIPs.  There is also evidence of nail pitting and in psoriatic arthritis there is not always overt evidence of skin plaques.  SLE does not usually present with obvious changes in the joints.
cardiovascular system,187,Which of the following should be avoided in broad complex tachycardia?,Cardioversion,Atenolol,Amiodarone,Verapamil,Sotalol,D,Verapamil should be avoided in broad complex tachycardia as it can present VF and haemodynamic collapse.
cardiovascular system,188,"An 20 year old student is brought to A and E following a collapse in an a night club. There was no suspicion of illicit drug use. He has had 3 collapse episodes previously. He had regained consciousness after a few minutes. There is nil of note on examination with BP and HR within normal parameters. However, an ECG shows a QT interval of 0.56. Which ion channel is likely to be defective and have caused these signs and symptoms?",Potassium,Chloride,Magnesium,Sodium,Calcium,A,"The majority of cases of Long QT syndrome are caused by defects in potassium channels, LQT1 and 2, which leads to prolonged depolarisation due to decrease in potassium outflow. Other causes are defect in sodium channel, LQT3 and mutation in LQT8 leading to calcium channels defects but these account for a smaller number."
cardiovascular system,189,"A 63-year-old male undergoes abdominal surgery. On Monday morning, three days post-operatively, repeat samples confirm a serum potassium of 7.1 mmol/L (3.5-4.9). His ECG shows broad QRS complexes. What is the most appropriate initial treatment?",5 ml of 5% calcium chloride given intravenously,10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate given intravenously,10 ml of insulin (actrapid) given subcutaneously,40 mg of furosemide given intravenously,50 ml of 8.4% sodium carbonate given intravenously,B,"Hyperkalaemia is a serum potassium over 5.0 mmol/L, which, if left untreated, may lead to arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. It can be treated in a number of ways. Giving calcium gluconate 5-10 mmol intravenously (IV) is effective. This can be repeated every 10-20 minutes until the ECG becomes normal. It does not reduce potassium but reduces myocardial excitability so protects the heart against arrhythmias. 50-100 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate (not carbonate) over 30 minutes IV results in the exchange of potassium ions for hydrogen ions across cell membranes and is also an effective treatment. Subcutaneous insulin will take too long to work. 50 ml of 50% dextrose with 5 units of insulin given as an infusion over 15-30 minutes will drive the potassium back into the cells. This will be effective for several hours. Oral or rectal calcium resonium (an ion exchange resin) and dialysis are also recognised methods but clearly take much longer to be effective. 250 mg furosemide or 5 mg bumetanide IV over one hour is also effective.

Bloods- increased troponin levels. What is the next step of management?",Beta blockers,Percutaneous angiography,Anticoagulant & heparin,Clopidogrel,Aspirin,E,"In any case of IHD, most important initial management is aspirin (unless decided to go for thrombolysis). Aspirin, the most widely used anti- platelet agent, is effective, safe, and inexpensive and is recommended for all patients undergoing PCI. Patients already on daily aspirin therapy should be given 75–325 mg of aspirin before PCI; those not taking aspirin should be given 500 mg at least 3 h before the procedure or 300 mg intravenously immediately before the procedure. After PCI, aspirin should be continued at 75–160 mg/day indefinitely"

What is the likeliest diagnosis?,HOCM,Coarctation of aorta,Tetralogy of Fallot,Patent ductus arteriosus,AS,B,The likeliest diagnosis is coarctation of the aorta with the finding of difference in BP in radial and femoral artery.  The other diagnosis would not lead to the findings above.
cardiovascular system,193,"A 45-year-old lawyer is referred to clinic with a blood pressure diary for advice on commencing therapy. He first consulted his general practitioner for a flare of eczema in January (which resolved with topical therapy) when hypertension was first identified. He is presently asymptomatic, with no other medical complaints other than his longstanding eczema. He has been visiting the gym regularly since February, and has a healthy diet. He is a current infrequent smoker, and drinks sporadically. He is of Nigerian descent. Electrocardiogram and urine dip are normal. His home blood pressure recordings are as follows:    January 152/90 mmHg   February 147/85 mmHg   March 153/87 mmHg   April 149/88 mmHg   May 151/86 mmHg    Which would be the most appropriate next step?",Prescribe amlodipine 5 mg,Prescribe bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg,Prescribe furosemide 20 mg,Prescribe ramipril 2.5 mg,Smoking cessation advice,A,"The patient's ethnicity subtly yet significantly alters recommended guidance. Amlodipine is the correct response. Under the age of 55, most patients are started on ACE inhibitors as a first line therapy for hypertension. Though patients of Afro-Caribbean descent are more prone to developing hypertension they have lower renin levels and are less responsive to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. Hypertension is hence better controlled by calcium channel blockers in this population, which mirrors what is advocated in patients with a new diagnosis of hypertension above the age of 55. If a calcium channel blocker is not suitable, for example because of oedema or intolerance, offer a thiazide-like diuretic such as chlortalidone (12.5-25.0 mg once daily) or indapamide (1.5 mg modified-release or 2.5 mg once daily) in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide. Smoking cessation advice is of course an important adjunct to control of blood pressure, although in view of consistently high readings in a patient with minimal smoke intake, pharmacotherapy is more appropriate.

cardiovascular system,194,"A 53-year-old man with a known history of Graves' disease presents to the Emergency Department with palpitations, anxiety, and fine tremor of both hands. ECG shows rapid atrial fibrillation (AF) with ventricular rate of 160 to 180/min. His blood pressure was 110/80 mmHg.    TSH 0.01 mU/L (0.4-5.0)   Free T4 60.3 pmol/L (10-22)    Which of the following is the immediate management for this patient?",Carbimazole,DC cardioversion,Digoxin,Propanolol,Warfarin,D,"This patient clearly has symptomatic hyperthyroidism. AF occurs in 10% to 25% of patients with hyperthyroidism, more commonly in men and the elderly than in women or patients less than 75-years-old. Together with the other symptoms described, it is generally caused by increased beta-adrenergic tone. Propranolol is effective in controlling all symptoms prior to initiation of specific therapy (e.g. carbimazole, which will have a more delayed effect on symptoms). Conversion to sinus rhythm frequently occurs spontaneously with treatment of hyperthyroidism. Digoxin is very rarely effective alone, but can be used in combination with propranolol if it is ineffective as a single agent. Electric or pharmacologic cardioversion would only generally be attempted in patients who are haemodynamically unstable in whom other treatments have been unsuccessful. AF is likely to recur if the underlying cause (i.e. hyperthyroidism in this situation) is not treated. If AF persists, consideration should be given to anticoagulation in patients who are at risk of embolic events but this would not be the first treatment you would initiate."
cardiovascular system,195,A 35 year old male with Wolff Parkinson White syndrome presents palpitations. His pulse is irregularly irregular and he is hypotensive. An ECG reveals an irregular rhythm with no p waves. How would you manage this patient?,Atenolol,Amiodarone,DC Cardioversion,Digoxin,Verapamil,C,This patient has developed AF which can complicate WPW syndrome. This patient is haemodynamically compromised and thus DC cardioversion is indicated. Verapamil and Digoxin should be avoided as this can lead to faster conduction along the abnormal path and may precipitate ventricular fibrillation.
cardiovascular system,196,A 42-year-old male admitted with dyspnoea is noted to have a murmur suggestive of mitral stenosis. The presence of which of the following clinical signs suggests that the mitral valve is mobile?,A soft first heart sound,A third heart sound,Fourth heart sound,Loud second heart sound,Opening snap,E,"Features of mitral stenosis include the loud first heart sound, opening snap and if in sinus rhythm, a pre-systolic accentuation. Calcification of the valve results in immobility and loss of the opening snap. All of the other features are not head in Mitral stenosis."

cardiovascular system,198,"A 75-year-old man presents with severe central crushing chest pain. ECG shows evidence of an inferior myocardial infarction (MI). He receives primary stenting to the proximal right coronary artery Four hours after initial presentation, he starts feeling dizzy and breathless. His pulse is 30 bpm regular, BP 70/50 mmHg. Heart sounds are soft and chest clear to auscultation. ECG shows 2:1 AV block with broad QRS and T wave inversion inferiorly. IV atropine was administered but had no effect. Which is the next most important treatment?",Emergency insertion of a permanent pacemaker,Emergency temporary transvenous pacing wire,IV dopamine,IV isoprenaline,Monitor his progress,B,"This patient has had an inferior MI which is commonly associated with conduction abnormalities. He now develops heart block which leaves him bradycardic, symptomatic, and with a low BP; simply monitoring progress is not appropriate. Isoprenaline is contraindicated in acute MI due to its positive inotropic effects and arrhythmogenic potential. IV dopamine is an inotrope which will not treat conduction block. A temporary wire would deal with the situation until the inferior MI has fully resolved. Conduction block can recover in the next few days so a permanent pacemaker may not be required"
cardiovascular system,199,"A 53-year-old pedestrian is brought to the Emergency Department after he was hit on a crossing by a car travelling at about 30 mph. He has numerous bruises and lacerations over his left chest wall. He is pale and anxious. His blood pressure is 90/64 mmHg, heart rate is 116 BPM, respiratory rate is 20/min and his jugular venous pressure is elevated. His trachea is central and breath sounds are normal bilaterally but the heart sounds are muffled. A chest radiograph shows fractured 4th, 5th and 6th ribs on the left side and an enlarged cardiac silhouette. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Cardiac tamponade,Diaphragmatic rupture,Ruptured thoracic aorta,Tension pneumothorax,Traumatic haemothorax,A,"Direct penetrating injury to the heart is the mostly likely aetiology for a cardiac tamponade although blunt injuries to the heart may also lead to this condition by injuring the pericardial vessels. Likewise, high velocity injuries to the great vessels (for example, thoracic aorta) could result in pooling of blood in the pericardium leading to tamponade. Apart from trauma it can occur following lung or breast carcinomas, myocardial infarctions, dissecting thoracic aneurysm and bacterial, viral or tuberculous pericarditis. Cardiac tamponade can be difficult to detect clinically, especially in a trauma setting. The classic (and diagnostic) signs include:  A fall in blood pressure Rising jugular venous pulse and Muffled heart sounds (Beck's triad).  Pulsus paradoxus may also be an associated finding (normally, there is a physiological decrease in systolic blood pressure during spontaneous inspiration. When this change exceeds 10 mmHg, it is termed pulsus paradoxus.). In addition, the jugular venous pulse may paradoxically rise with inspiration (Kussmaul's sign). Chest radiograph may reveal a globular heart, a convex or straight left heart border, and a right cardiophrenic angle of less than 90°. Plain chest x ray, ECG, echocardiography and diagnostic pericardiocentesis are the commonly used investigations to diagnose cardiac tamponade. Side effects of cardiac pericardiocentesis include injury to the cardiac muscle, chamber(s) of the heart and, rarely, to the great vessels. If the needle enters the cardiac muscle, commonly into the ventricular muscle, an injury pattern known as the 'current of injury' appears on the ECG monitor. This is characterised by extreme ST-T wave changes or a widening and enlarged QRS complex. This pattern dictates that the pericardiocenthesis needle should be withdrawn until the previous baseline ECG tracing reappears. If the needle enters the left ventricle or ascending aorta, bright red arterial blood is found which should prompt withdrawal of the needle."

cardiovascular system,203,"A 70-year-old known hypertensive and diabetic patient presents with dyspnoea on minimal exertion. He reports being comfortable at rest, but minor exertion results in significant fatigue and dyspnoea. On examination he is pale, pulse rate is 98/min and regular, BP is 160/70 mmHg and there are fine basal crepitations in the lungs. ECG showed left ventricular hypertrophy and renal function was slightly deranged. Which is the most appropriate long term treatment for cardiac failure in this patient?",ACE-I alone,Furosemide alone,"Spironolactone, ramipril, and aspirin","Spironolactone, ramipril, and carvedilol","Spironolactone, ramipril, and digoxin",D,"This gentleman has NYHA class III cardiac failure. All patients with cardiac failure should be on an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i) if there is no contraindication. In this patient there will be an additional benefit with regard to treating his hypertension and prevention of diabetic nephropathy. Once stable, a β blocker should be added. It is proven that cardioselective β blockers have important beneficial effects especially in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. The randomised Aldactone evaluation study (RALES) trial showed 30% reduction in mortality when spironolactone (25 mg) was added to the standard therapy, and NICE therefore recommends it as second line therapy following an ACE-inhibitor and beta blocker. However, in NYHA class III and IV cardiac failure, it can be used upfront and is therefore indicated here. The patient's slight renal dysfunction is not a contraindication, but you would need to monitor renal function and adjust treatment appropriately if it further deteriorated. Digoxin is used in heart failure with atrial fibrillation. As it is a weak positive inotrope, its role in heart failure with sinus rhythm may be best reserved if the patient remains symptomatic despite optimal therapy. Elderly patients with renal impairment are at increased risk of toxicity, and therefore it requires close monitoring if it is required."
cardiovascular system,204,Which of the following is true regarding the insertion of a pulmonary artery catheter (flotation or flow-directed)?,Air in the manometer tubing may result in over-estimation of the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure,Associated with a less than 10% incidence of arrhythmias,Associated with rupture of a pulmonary vein,Contraindicated in the presence of right bundle branch block,Facilitated during deep inspiration in a spontaneously ventilating patient,E,"The complications associated with the insertion of pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) include:  Arrhythmias (up to 70%) Right bundle branch block Pulmonary infarction Pulmonary artery (not vein) rupture (0.2%) Sepsis Knotting of the catheter Thrombosis, and Complications of central venous cannulation (e.g. arterial puncture, pneumothorax, air embolism).  For the PAC to enter the pulmonary circulation, it should be advanced during maximal pulmonary blood flow (inspiration with spontaneous ventilation and expiration with positive pressure ventilation). The manometer tubing connecting the pressure transducer to the PAC is fluid filled, and it should be free of air bubbles, the presence of which can result in damping of the trace and under-estimation of the pulmonary artery occlusion pressure.

There are bibasal crackles on auscultation consistent with heart failure, and O2 saturations on air are reduced to 92%. Routine bloods are unremarkable. Chest x ray reveals evidence of cardiomegaly with bilateral upper lobe diversion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Ischaemic cardiomyopathy,Peripartum cardiomyopathy,Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH),Pulmonary embolism,Viral myocarditis,B,"The answer is peripartum cardiomyopathy, (PCM). This patient presents with symptoms and signs of biventricular heart failure during the third trimester. This fits with a diagnosis of PCM, the aetiology of which is unknown, although both myocarditis and low levels of dietary selenium have been postulated as causes. Management of PCM is similar to the management of heart failure in any other situation with vasodilators, diuretics, and beta blockade. ACE inhibition is reserved for the postpartum period. Ischaemic cardiomyopathy is unlikely given the lack of risk factors for IHD, and both primary pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary embolism would present with signs of right sided cardiac strain rather than the biventricular failure seen here.

Aortic regurgitation may be a feature of osteogenesis imperfecta. Ebstein's anomaly is associated with maternal LiCO3 use if exposed in the first trimester. The majority of cases of neonates with complete heart block may be caused by autoimmune disease, particularly anti-ro antibodies in the mother.

Myocarditis is unlikely to be present in the absence of rejection or infection. The other answers though not impossible are very unlikley. Please see attached link for more information. Many thanks "
cardiovascular system,217,A 28-year-old man who is known to have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has an out of hospital cardiac arrest and is successfully resuscitated. What is the most appropriate mode of treatment?,Alcohol septal ablation,Amiodarone,Beta-blocker,Implantable defibrillator,Myomectomy,D,"Patients with HCM are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) due to ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT). Implantable cardio-defibrillators (ICD) are superior to amiodarone or beta blockers for preventing this. Reducing outflow tract obstruction with myomectomy or alcohol septal ablation does not reduce the risk of SCD. Other indications for ICD implantation include:  Cardiac arrest due to VF/VT. Sustained VT causing haemodynamic compromise. Chronic heart failure, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than 40% and associated syncopal episodes due to non-sustained VT post-myocardial infarction, non- sustained VT with LVEF less than 40%. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy causing cardiac arrest. Congenital long QT with family history of sudden cardiac death at young age."
cardiovascular system,218,"Following a road traffic accident, a patient is brought by ambulance to the Emergency Department. The primary survey reveals an open fracture of the right femur, which is bleeding profusely. In terms of his cardiovascular physiology, what is the likely response to this blood loss? ",Cardiac output is increased because of increased stroke volume and decreased heart rate,Heart rate is increased because of increased vagal stimulation of the sinoatrial node,Stroke volume is decreased because of hypovolaemia,Total peripheral resistance is increased due to a decreased sympathetic output,Venous return is increased because of decreased sympathetic output to the venous system,C,"The compensation mechanisms to sudden hypovolaemia include:  Cardiac output (CO) can increase, decrease, or stay the same (CO = HR × SV). In this clinical scenario, it is likely that HR will increase, but stroke volume may decrease due to the hypovolaemia. Heart rate (HR) can increase due to decreased (parasympathetic) vagal stimulation and enhanced sympathetic stimulation with adrenaline. Total peripheral resistance can increase due to increased sympathetic drive. This causes peripheral vasoconstriction and preserves blood flow to essential organs, such as the brain, heart, and kidneys. Venous return increases if sympathetic output increases, and this is related to the peripheral vasoconstriction. Less blood can pool in the peripheral vessels so it is transported back to the central circulation quickly. This increases venous return and maximises stroke volume."
cardiovascular system,219,Deficiency of which one of the following trace elements is implicated as a cause of cardiomyopathy?,Chromium,Copper,Manganese,Selenium,Zinc,D,Selenium deficiency is one of the reversible causes of dilated cardiomyopathy. Zinc deficiency can lead to imparied skin integrity and wound healing.  Copper deficiency can lead to memory problems and brittle bones.  Chromium deficiency can increase the risk of developing diabetes. Manganese deficiency is rare and presents with bone and growth abnormalities in children.
cardiovascular system,220,"A 58 year old gentleman has severe central crushing chest pain for about half an hour which is finally relieved by GTN. There is evidence of ST depression in the anterolateral leads and his troponin is elevated. He is treated with aspirin, clopidogrel and LMWH. What is the next appropriate management?",Discharged with Outpatient cardiac clinic follow up,Urgent coronary angiography as an inpatient,Exercise Tolerance Test,Cardiac Rehabilitation,Coronary Angiography as an outpatient,B,This patient has had an NSTEMI and thus he need coronary angiography urgently as an inpatient as he is at high risk.
cardiovascular system,221,Which one of the following statements is true concerning complete atrioventricular septal defects?,Are seen frequently in patients with trisomy 21,Frequently have aortic valve (AV) insufficiency,Have a normal mitral valve structure,Include a coronary sinus atrial septal defect (ASD),Include a perimembranous ventricular septal defect,A,Partial AV canal defects or ostium primum ASDs are seen in Down's syndrome. Sinus venous defects seem to be rare in Down's syndrome. Possibly 50% of children with Down's syndrome have a cardiac defect. 
cardiovascular system,222,"A 87-year-old obese lady presents to the Emergency Department with a two hour history of central chest pain. This is associated with sweating and breathlessness. The patient has a history of hypertension and diabetes. Her resting 12 lead ECGs demonstrate significant ST depression in the lateral leads. She has been given 300 mg aspirin by the paramedics. You call the cardiology registrar on-call to discuss the case. There is an on-site cardiac intervention laboratory equipped to manage unstable patients. In discussion with the cardiology registrar, he asks your opinion on the patient's bleeding risk. From the list, which of these features is associated with a higher bleeding risk?",Diabetes,Low body weight,Obesity,Use of proton-pump inhibitors,Younger age,B,"The early management of unstable angina depends on the use of antiplatelet and anti-thrombotic treatments alongside reperfusion therapy. There are a number of different anti-thrombotic agents and the choice (and dose) varies between centres. The choice of agent also depends on patient factors, one being the patient's risk of bleeding. Risk factors for bleeding are:  Advancing age Renal impairment Low body weight, and Known bleeding problems.  PPIs do not interact in this way. "
cardiovascular system,223,"A 79-year-old woman has had worsening shortness of breath for several years. She now has to sleep sitting up on two pillows. She has difficulty swallowing. There is no history of chest pain. She is afebrile. Recently, she suffered a stroke with left hemiparesis. A chest x ray reveals a near normal left ventricular size with a prominent left atrial border. Which of the following conditions is most likely to account for these findings?",Aortic coarctation,Cardiomyopathy,Essential hypertension,Left renal artery stenosis,Mitral valve stenosis,E,"Mitral valve stenosis leads to left atrial enlargement, but the left ventricle is usually small. An enlarged left atrium may lead to pressure posteriorly on the oesophagus. Most mitral valvular disease in adults results from rheumatic heart disease. All of the other options to not cause atrial enlargment but rather ventricular or a gross cardiac abnormalities."
cardiovascular system,224,"A 66-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes given ibuprofen for a knee injury is admitted with palpitations. His electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a rate of 105 beats per minute, with absent P waves and tall T waves. His urea and electrolytes show:    Sodium 132 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 6.4 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 11 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 180 µmol/L (60-110)    In this scenario, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?",Calcium gluconate IV,Calcium resonium orally,Dextrose 50 mls 50% with 10 units insulin,Dialysis,Furosemide 1 mg/kg IV,A,"The ECG suggests cardiotoxicity related to hyperkalaemia and the history of palpitations is suggestive of arrhythmias. Therefore cardio protection with calcium chloride or gluconate should be first priority and lowering potassium levels immediately thereafter. Calcium antagonises the effects of hyperkalaemia on a cellular level by a number of mechanisms. These all return myocyte excitability to normal thereby reducing the risk of arrhythmias. Calcium gluconate is the preferred preparation, but calcium chloride can be used. Caution is needed if the patient is taking digoxin, as hypercalcaemia can potentiate its toxicity. The effects of intravenous calcium occur within one to three minutes but last for only 30-60 minutes, and therefore more definitive treatment is needed to lower potassium levels. After calcium is given, treatment is required to shift potassium intracellularly. Insulin is most commonly used, which stimulates the Na-K ATPase pump. The effect is seen within 10-20 minutes and usually decreases potassium levels by 0.6-1mEq/L. Salbutamol can also increase the action of the Na-K ATPase pump. Sodium bicarbonate infusion can shift potassium intracellularly by increasing blood pH, but its use is controversial. It is therefore reserved for cases of severe acidosis, or where there is another indication for its use (for example, TCA overdose). If the above treatments fail, and the cause of hyperkalaemia cannot be treated, then potassium may need to be removed from the body. The most efficient way to do this is with haemodialysis. This is only done in resistant cases, or in patients who are already on haemodialysis. For most patients, treatment with an exchange resin such as sodium polystyrene sulphonate is more appropriate. "
cardiovascular system,225,A 22 year old male presents following an episode of syncope. There is a family history of sudden cardiac death. An ECG reveals an incomplete right bundle branch block and coved ST elevation in anterior precordial leads. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome,Romano-Ward Syndrome,Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy,Brugada syndrome,Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome,D,The ECG findings are characteristic of the Brugada syndrome. This is an autosomal dominant condition. It is due to a mutation in the cardiac voltage gated sodium channel. It presents as syncope or cardiac arrest as ventricular fibrillation can occur. In WPW there is a short PR interval and delta wave. Both the Romano-Ward syndrome and Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome are long QT syndromes. In HOCM there is LVH on ECG and ST and T wave changes.
cardiovascular system,226,A 19-year-old girl presents with recurrent episodes of loss of consciousness. Over the last two years she has had blackouts which last approximately 30 seconds. They typically occur when she is standing. These have occurred more frequently over the last week. The latest episode was witnessed by her boyfriend who noted that she collapsed without any abnormal movements. On coming round she was rather drowsy initially but generally fine and recovered relatively quickly. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Addison's disease,Atonic seizures,Cardiac syncope,Complex partial seizures,Vasovagal syncope,E,"This young girl has features suggestive of vasovagal syncope. From the description above it suggests that:  the episodes always occur when she is standing (whereas cardiac syncope could occur at any time but may be precipitated by exercise without warning.) there are no abnormal movements (making epilepsy less likely) and there is a pretty full recovery (again making epilepsy less likely).  Addison's would likely be associated with other autoimmune phenomena, which are not menitoned here and other symptoms such as muscle weakness or low mood."
cardiovascular system,227,"A 37-year-old female patient who is undergoing treatment for breast cancer is admitted to the acute medical assessment unit with a seven-day history of increasing breathlessness. On examination, she looks breathless. Her JVP is elevated with prominent andquot;xandquot; and andquot;yandquot; descents. The heart sounds are soft. A 12 lead ECG shows low voltage complexes. Transthoracic echocardiography shows pericardial thickening with a restrictive Doppler pattern. With regard to the investigation findings, which is the most likely cause of this patient's pericardial disease?",Dermatomyositis,Mediastinal irradiation,Scleroderma,SLE,Uraemia,B,"All the options listed here are causes of pericardial disease. The echo findings, in this case, are strongly suggestive of constrictive pericarditis where dense fibrous tissue replaces the normal pericardium. Common causes include irradiation, TB, and any cause of purulent pericarditis. Therefore the correct answer is mediastinal irradiation."
cardiovascular system,228,In hypovolaemic shock which of the following is true?,A narrowed pulse pressure indicates significant blood loss,Anuria (less than 17 ml/hr) occurs early,Haematocrit and haemoglobin are good indicators of estimated blood loss,Tachycardia and lowered blood pressure are early manifestations,Vasodilatation is an early response to blood loss,A,"Haemorrhage is the commonest cause of shock and post injury death in the trauma patient, and the only method of stopping on-going losses and stabilising the patient may be surgical. Therefore early surgical review is vital, along with early identification of shock itself. Early circulatory changes are compensatory and include tachycardia and cutaneous vasoconstriction. As the amount of blood loss increases and tissue perfusion further decreases, urine output is reduced and so eventually is the patient's level of conciousness. Significant reduction in blood pressure is a relatively late manifestation and a narrowed pulse pressure is an indicator of significant blood loss. Unfortunately haemoglobin and haematocrit are unreliable in estimating acute blood loss, and should not be used for diagnosing shock as they may only show minimal acute decrease in massive blood loss. Oliguria is defined as a urine output of less than 17 ml/hr or more practically less than 400 ml in 24 hours. Oliguria only occurs when 30-40% of the circulating volume (class III haemorrhage) has been lost. Anuria is defined as a urine output of less than 50 ml in 24 hours and only occurs when greater than 40% of the circulating volume has been lost. "
cardiovascular system,229,"A 17-year-old girl is short in stature for her age. She has not shown any changes of puberty. She has a webbed neck. Her vital signs include: temperature 36.6°C, respiratory rate 18/min, pulse 75 bpm, and BP 165/85 mmHg. On physical examination, she has a continuous murmur heard over both the front of the chest as well as her back. Her lower extremities are cool with poor capillary filling. A chest radiograph reveals a prominent left heart border, no oedema nor effusions, and rib notching. Which of the following pathologic lesions best explains these findings?",Constriction of the aorta past the ductus arteriosus,Lack of development of the spiral septum and partial absence of conus musculature,Shortening and thickening of chordae tendineae of the mitral valve,Single large atrioventricular valve,Supravalvular narrowing in the aortic root,A,"She has coarctation of the aorta, and the constriction is postductal, allowing prolonged survival. Her physical characteristics also suggest Turner syndrome (monosomy X)."
cardiovascular system,230,"A 45-year-old man is admitted to emergency department with excruciating pain in the right leg. Examination: limb is pale and dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses are absent. Pulse=88bpm, irregular and he has apansystolic murmur at apex. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Thromboangitis Obliterans,Sciatica,DVT,Atherosclerosis,Embolus,E,Pansystolic murmur at apex indicates mitral regurgitation and irregular pulse indicates AF which can lead to thrombus formation what probably is responsible for this embolus in leg
cardiovascular system,231,A 67-year-old man had successful thrombolysis for an inferior MI 1 month ago and was discharged after 5 days. He is now readmitted with pulmonary edema. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Aortic regurgitation,Ischemic mitral regurgitation,Mitral valve prolapse,Pulmonary stenosis,Rheumatic mitral valve stenosis,B,"ischaemic mitral regurgitation > raised pulmonary capillary pressure > pulmonary oedema. Inferior myocardial infarction causes left ventricular remodeling, which displaces posterior papillary muscle away from its normal position, leading to ischemic mitral regurgitation"
cardiovascular system,232,Which one of the following is true of lung ventilation perfusion scanning in patients suspected of thromboembolism?,A normal perfusion scan virtually excludes pulmonary embolism,It is contraindicated in pregnancy,It is contraindicated in those with iodine hypersensitivity,The appearances of the scan in emphysema resemble those in pulmonary embolism,There is reduced perfusion in the upper lobes in mitral stenosis,A,"Increased pulmonary venous pressure, especially secondary to mitral valve disease, causes increased flow to the upper lobes. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) usually gives rise to matched defects. Radiation to fetus is small. VQ scan is not contraindicated in pregnant women, although the perfusion only scan is adequate. Xenon is used for imaging ventilation, whilst technetium labelled macroaggregated human serum albumin (MAA) is used to image perfusion. A normal perfusion scan has a sensitivity of 98% but a specificity of only 40%."
cardiovascular system,233,"A 57-year-old woman who has been receiving haemodialysis for the past five years is found dead in bed by her husband. She had a long history of type 1 diabetes for over 20 years and in her later years, suffered from neuropathy and retinopathy as well as chronic renal failure. Most recently she was under investigation for angina. Which of the following is the most likely cause of death in this patient?",Hyperkalaemia,Hypoglycaemia,Myocardial infarction,Pulmonary embolus,Stroke,C,"Patients who undergo long-term haemodialysis suffer from increasing arterial calcification, which is associated with both increased risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, but the greatest absolute increase is in MI rates. Interestingly, trials of high-dose statins have proved disappointing in the dialysis population, suggesting that calcification drives much of the increased risk. Whilst both hypoglycaemia and hyperkalaemia are alternative possibilities as causes of death, myocardial infarction is more likely than both to have been responsible."
cardiovascular system,234,"A 43-year-old lady is admitted with pyrexia, arthropathy, breathlessness and syncope. She was recently diagnosed with pulmonary emboli. There is an early diastolic sound and a mid-diastolic rumble. Her JVP is elevated with prominent a-waves. What is the most likely cause?",Mitral regurgitation,Ventricular ectopics,Pulmonary regurgitation,Atrial myxoma,Complete heart block,D,"Atrial myxomas are the most common primary heart tumors. Two-dimensional echocardiography is the diagnostic procedure of choice. Most atrial myxomas are benign and can be removed by surgical resection. Constitutional symptoms that include fever, weight loss, arthralgias, and Raynaud phenomenon. These symptoms may be related to overproduction of interleukin-6. Left heart failure may cause dyspnea on exertion caused by obstruction at the mitral valve orifice. Valve damage may result in mitral regurgitation. Jugular venous pressure may be elevated, and a prominent A wave may be present. An early diastolic sound, called a tumor plop, is heard. A diastolic atrial rumble may be heard if the tumor is obstructing the mitral or tricuspid valve. Systemic or pulmonary embolization may occur from left- or right-sided tumors. Embolization to the central nervous system may result in transient ischemic attack, stroke, or seizure"
cardiovascular system,235,"A 24-year-old woman develops infective endocarditis involving the aortic valve. She receives a porcine bioprosthesis because of her desire to have children and not to take anticoagulant medication. After ten years, she must have this prosthetic valve replaced. Which of the following pathological findings in the bioprosthesis has most likely led to the need for replacement?",Calcification with stenosis,Dehiscence,Infective endocarditis,Strut failure,Thrombosis,A,"The bioprosthesis has the advantage of not requiring anticoagulation, but it does not wear well with time, and typically must be replaced within five to 10 years. All the other responses can occur but are significantly less common causes of late bioprosthetic valve failure."
cardiovascular system,236,Which of the following produce severe hyperkalaemia in combination?,Aspirin and allopurinol,Furosemide and amiloride,Lisinopril and furosemide,Losartan and amiloride,Propranolol and verapamil,D,The combination of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin blockers with potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone and amiloride may produce dangerous hyperkalaemia. Amiloride is often given with furosemide (co-amilofruse) to replete potassium stores. Propranolol is not given with verapamil due to the induction of severe bradycardia. 
cardiovascular system,237,A 73-year-old male is referred with palpitations. On 24 hour ambulatory ECG monitoring he is shown to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and is treated with amiodarone. Through blockade of which of the following receptors is the antiarrhythmic effect of amiodarone most attributed?,Alpha receptors,Beta receptors,Calcium channels,Potassium channels,Sodium channels,D,"Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic and as such is used in many supra- and ventricular arrhythmias. Its antiarrhythmic effects are due mostly to the inhibition of the rapid component of the delayed potassium rectifier IKr channel (as with sotalol) but also an effect on the slow component. However, it is also recognised to have mild alpha blocking effects, beta blocking effects and calcium channel blocking effects although these are less responsible for the antiarrhythmic effects."
cardiovascular system,238,A 60-year-old patiet who has had a MI a week back presents with dyspnea and pericardial rub. ECG shows ST elevation. CXR: loss of margin at costo-vertebral angle. What is the single most likely cause?,Cardiac tamponade,Mitral regurge,Dressler’s syndrome,Atrial fib,Emboli,C,"Dressler syndrome is a secondary form of pericarditis that occurs in the setting of injury to the heart or the pericardium such as heart attack (myocardial infarction), heart surgery, heart procedure, or chest trauma due to an accident or injury. It is also known as post-myocardial infarction syndrome, post-cardiac injury syndrome, or post-pericardiotomy syndrome. Dressler’s syndrome is characterized by combinations of pericarditis, pleuritis, and pneumonitis. This pleuritis is responsible for pleural effusion leading to loss of margin at costo-vertebral angle. The disease consists of a persistent low-grade fever, chest pain (usually pleuritic), pericarditis (usually evidenced by a pericardial friction rub, chest pain worsening when recumbent, and diffuse ST elevation with PR segment depression), and/or a pericardial effusion. The symptoms tend to occur 2–3 weeks after myocardial infarction but can also be delayed a few months. It tends to subside in a few days, and very rarely leads to pericardial tamponade"
cardiovascular system,239,A 32-year-old male is referred with chronic renal dysfunction and is discovered to have adult polycystic kidney disease (APKD). His blood pressure is consistently 140-150/90 mmHg. Which of the following antihypertensives is the most appropriate for the management of this man's blood pressure?,ACE inhibitor,Betablocker,Calcium channel blocker,Diuretic,Moxonidine,A,"Autosomal dominant APKD-1 is a relatively common disorder accounting for approximately 8% of cases of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The best drugs for this condition are ACE inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril, or lisinopril) or angiotensin II receptor antagonist blockers (e.g. telmisartan, losartan, irbesartan, or candesartan). Calcium channel blockers are not encouraged to be used. However, although widely used and recommended, there is no evidence that the renin-angiotensin system is affected in the disease. "
cardiovascular system,240,Features of atrial fibrillation (AF) include which of the following?,Discordant apical and radial rate,Pulsus paradoxus,Radio-femoral pulse delay,Regularly irregular pulse,Water hammer pulse,A,"AF is the commonest rhythm disturbance, and is associated with a discordance between apical and radial rate, an irregularly irregular pulse rate and, of course, AV dissociation, as not all the atrial impulses are conducted. Radio femoral delay is associated with coarctation, and pulsus paradoxus with conditions such as severe asthma or pericardial effusion. Water hammer pulse is associated with increased stroke volume of the left ventricle and decrease in the peripheral resistance, leading to the widened pulse pressure of aortic regurgitation."
cardiovascular system,241,"A 60-year-old woman presents to the surgical outpatient clinic with ulceration over the tips of the toes in her left foot and a large ulcer over her right heel. She also complains of paraesthesia in both feet. The ankle-brachial pressure indices are 1.05 on the right and 1.2 on the left. On neurological assessment, proprioception and vibration sense are reduced. Choose the single most appropriate diagnosis.",Hypertensive ulcer (Martorell's ulcer),Neuropathic ulcer,Pyoderma gangrenosum,Squamous cell carcinoma,Vasculitic ulcer,B,"This patient is most likely to have a neuropathic ulcer, usually resulting from peripheral sensory neuropathy secondary to diabetes mellitus. The other causes for altered sensory neuropathy leading to neuropathic ulcers include:  Spinal cord injuries Spina bifida Syringomyelia Alcohol abuse, and Leprosy.  The usual sites in the lower limb for neuropathic ulceration are the head of the metatarsals, interdigital clefts, heel (calcaneum) and the lateral malleolus. In diabetic patients, the ankle-brachial pressure indices may be falsely elevated, even in those with major vessel disease. This is due to calcification of the vessel walls and medial sclerosis. Neurological assessment may reveal altered sensation, including proprioception and two point discrimination in the foot or toes, and reduced vibration sense."
cardiovascular system,242,B type natriuretic peptide is likely to be normal in which of the following?,Acute STEMI,Acute mitral regurgitation,Unstable angina,LVF,Pulmonary Embolus,C,"BNP is likely to be normal in unstable angina. It is released when there is an increase in cardiac pressures most commonly secondary to volume distension but also due to obstruction to flow. It causes increase sodium excretion and decreases peripheral vascular resistance. STEMI, LVF and mitral regurgitation lead to increased volume and this release of BNP whilst PE leads to increased cardiac pressure due to obstruction to flow. Unstable angina does not lead to raised intracardiac pressure thus does not cause elevated BNP."
cardiovascular system,243,A 76-year-old man is in the CCU 2 days after an acute MI. He tells you that he had an episode of rapid pounding in the chest lasting for about 2minutes. He remains conscious throughout. What is the most likely rhythm?,SVT,VF,VT,V-ectopics,A-fib,D,"Why not VT? Non sustained VT lasts less than 30 seconds. So it is not non sustained VT. Again sustained VT causes syncope, but patient was conscious. So it is not sustained VT as well. There may be runs of V-ectopics. So the answer is D. V-ectopics"
cardiovascular system,244,"A 42 year old male presents with fatigue, fever, night sweats and weight loss. He has been recently unwell with what he presumed was a viral infection. On examination there is evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy. You also noted quiet heart sounds and a pericardial rub. He is tachycardic. There is evidence of hepatosplenomegaly. Bloods reveal a pancytopenia. An Echo confirms a pericardial effusion. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute myocardial infarction,Coxsackie B viral infection,Idiopathic,Tuberculosis,Lymphoma,E,"The history, clinical findings and pancytopenia are suggestive that the underlying diagnosis which has led to a pericardial effusion is lymphoma. Coxsackie B although is a common cause of pericardial effusion is unlikely to account for all the other symptoms. Tuberculosis should be suspected in those with HIV or other immunosuppression however the cervical lymphadenopathy and pancytopenia make lymphoma more likely than tuberculosis."
cardiovascular system,245,A 70-year-old woman with established aortic stenosis (AS) attends for annual review. Which one of the following factors is the most important in deciding the timing of surgery?,Aortic valve gradient of 50 mmHg,Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),The intensity of the murmur,The patient's symptomatology,Valvular calcification,D,"The patient's symptomatology is the most important determinant in terms of the decision to operate on stenotic aortic valves. Dyspnoea, chest pain, and syncope are all features of aortic stenosis, and when present suggest a poor prognosis if left. A gradient of 50 mmHg would be regarded as moderate to severe aortic stenosis, but you would still consider the patient's symptoms prior to deciding to operate. This gradient is measured as the mean gradient over the valve; the peak gradient can also be considered and a value of over 60 mmHg is considered severe. Left ventricular hypertrophy is a common feature of aortic stenosis, and alone does not influence the decision for surgery. Calcific aortic disease is again not important in isolation, and the symptoms and gradient should be considered."
cardiovascular system,246,A 52-year-old man underwent a hemicolectomy. After a few days he complains of left ventricular pain and fever. ECHO has been done and shows a systolic murmur. What is the next appropriate investigation?,CT,US,CXR,Blood culture,LFT,D,"History of surgery, left ventricular pain, fever and murmur suggest a diagnosis isinfective endocarditis. Therefore the next appropriate investigation is blood culture"
cardiovascular system,247,A 58-year-old man has had an enlarging abdomen for several months. He has experienced no abdominal or chest pain. On physical examination he has a non-tender abdomen with no masses palpable but there is a fluid thrill. An abdominal ultrasound scan shows a large abdominal fluid collection with a small cirrhotic liver. A chest x ray shows a globally enlarged heart. Which of the following conditions is most likely to be present?,Dilated cardiomyopathy,Lymphocytic myocarditis,Myocardial amyloid deposition,Nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis,Severe occlusive coronary atherosclerosis,A,This man has alcoholic liver cirrhosis with ascites. The cardiomyopathy of alcoholism is a dilated or congestive form.
cardiovascular system,248,"A 25 year old female is referred due to palpitations. On examination her heart rate and blood pressure are normal, chest is clear however there is splitting of the first heart sound. On an ECG what is the first heart sound associated with?",S wave,T wave,P wave,Q wave,R Wave,E,The R wave is most associated with the first heart sound.
cardiovascular system,249,A 55-year-old man is having slow growing ascites. When we tap the peritoneal fluid the protein is <25 and it is clear and yellow. What could be the origin for ascites?,Budd-Chiari,Gastrinoma,Hepatoma,TB,Pancreatitis,A,In gastrinoma there is no ascites! In hepatoma there will be exudative ascites as in TB and pancreatitis. Budd-Chiary syndrome causes transudative ascites and the likely option here
cardiovascular system,250,A 67-year-old man presents with sudden onset atrial fibrillation (ventricular rate of 150/minute). His serum creatinine concentration was 250 µmol/L (70-110). Which is the main factor that determines the choice of loading dose of digoxin in this patient?,Absorption,Apparent volume of distribution,Lipid solubility,Plasma half life,Renal clearance,E,"The pharmacokinetics of digoxin are complex and best explained by a two compartment model. The loading dose is mainly dependent on the volume of distribution of a drug but this patient has moderate renal failure. The loading dose is calculated (using various models) by taking into account age, creatinine clearance, body surface area, etc. Volume of distribution becomes important particularly when body weight is 40 kg or less. On balance it is the renal failure that is the most important factor in this patient in determining the loading dose. Digoxin is cleared by the kidneys so the maintenance dose would require adjustment in renal failure. "
cardiovascular system,251,"A 72-year-old woman has weight loss and heat intolerance. Investigations:    Free T4 32.9 pmol/L (9.8-23.1)   TSH less than0.02 mU/L (0.35-5.50)   Free T3 11.1 pmol/L (3.5-6.5)    She is taking medication for atrial fibrillation, ischaemic heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Which drug is most likely to be responsible for these results?",Amiodarone,Digoxin,Glibenclamide,Metformin,Simvastatin,A,Amiodarone frequently causes abnormalities in thyroid function tests and may cause both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. It may cause the former by interfering with the conversion of thyroxine (T4) to tri-iodothyronine (T3) and it may produce the latter either through thyroiditis or donation of iodine (amiodarone contains a large quantity of iodine). Other side effects of amiodarone include pulmonary fibrosis and photosensitivity reactions. 
cardiovascular system,252,"A 72-year-old woman presented with acute severe chest pain with an ECG revealing ST segment elevation in leads II, III and, aVF. She was treated with thrombolysis but two days later became acutely unwell. Examination revealed a loud systolic murmur at the apex which radiated into the axilla with associated pulmonary oedema. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute left ventricular failure,Cardiogenic shock,Pericarditis,Ruptured papillary muscle,Ventricular septal defect,D,The most likely explanation in this patient with a prior inferior myocardial infarct is mitral valve prolapse due to papillary muscle rupture.
cardiovascular system,253,You are asked to review a 52 year old gentleman who has become suddenly unwell and hypotensive.  He had an STEMI 2 days previously.  On examination he has a pansystolic murmur lowest at the lower left sternal border and a raised JVP. Further investigation reveals a high right atrial pressure and low left atrial pressure.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aortic regurgitation,VSD,Mitral regurgitation,Aortic Stenosis,Tricuspid regurgitation,E,"The history and findings of high right atrial pressure suggests tricuspid regurgitation which can occur post MI and is more commonly seen in those with chronic lung disease, endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease and congenital abnormalities. It leads to a pansystolic murmur at the LLSE, raised JVP and pulsatile liver and sometimes a RV impulse."
cardiovascular system,254,"A 65-year-old man has an ejection systolic murmur and narrow pulse pressure on clinical examination. There is no history of chest pain, breathlessness, or syncope. An ECHO confirms aortic stenosis and shows an aortic valve gradient of 40 mmHg. There is good left ventricular function. Which of the following management options is the most appropriate choice in this case?",Anticoagulation,Aortic valvuloplasty,Cardiology outpatient review,Routine aortic valve replacement,Urgent aortic valve replacement,C,"Indications for surgery in aortic stenosis include a gradient of 50 mmHg or more, or associated symptoms such as syncope, breathlessness, and episodes of pulmonary oedema. This patient should be monitored in cardiology clinic so that a decision on the timing of valve surgery can be made."
cardiovascular system,255,A 20 year old male collapses at a night club.  He is otherwise fit and well.   There was a first aider on hand who saw the patient suddenly collapse whilst dancing.  He states it was difficult to find a pulse when he had collapsed.  An ECG shows a QT interval of 0.58.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Long QT syndrome,Vasovagal episode,Substance Abuse,HOCM,Jervell Lange Nielsen syndrome,A,The QT is prolonged thus the patient is suffering from Long QT syndrome (due to sodium or potassium channel mutations).   JLN syndrome also leads to a prolonged QT but there is associated deafness.  This patient is likely to have developed Torsades de pointes due to the exertion.  The other options do not lead to a prolonged QT syndrome.
cardiovascular system,256,"A patient who 2 days previously had suffered a STEMI is suffering from acute SOB.  On examination there is bilateral crackles to mid zones and a pan systolic murmur, loudest at the apex.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute mitral regurgitation,Ventricular rupture,Acute tricuspid regurgitation,Ventricular septal defect,Aortic Stenosis,A,"Given the history and clinical findings this patient is likely to have ruptured his chordae tendineae leading to acute mitral regurgitation.  An urgent Echo should be performed.  Emergency surgical repair is required however in the acute setting ACE inhibitors, diuretics and sometimes anticoagulation are utilised before surgery.  Aortic stenosis is not a complication of an MI. In VSD you would expect the murmur to be present at the lower sternal edge, as with TR.  With ventricular rupture there is usually no murmur and there may be signs of tamponade."
cardiovascular system,257,A 75-year-old lady who had mitral valve replacement 13 years ago has developed recurrent breathlessness. Her husband has noticed prominent pulsation in her neck. She complains of abdominal pain and ankle swelling. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Aortic regurgitation,Mitral regurgitation,Mitral stenosis,Tricuspid regurgitation,Pulmonary stenosis,D,"Long standing complication of mitral valve replacement is tricuspid regurgitation. In tricuspid regurgitation there is recurrent breathlessness (mostly exertional), prominent pulsation in the neck (giant V wave), abdominal pain due to enlarged congested liver (due to CHF), ankle oedema due to right heart failure"
cardiovascular system,258,A 60 year old who is on Lithium for bipolar disorder is found to be hypertensive by her GP is to be commenced on anti hypertensive therapy.  What anti hypertensive would you prescribe to limit the risk of lithium toxicity?,Atenolol,Ramipril,Bendroflumethiazide,Losartan,Amlodipine,A,Atenolol is the safest option. Thiazides with lithium lead to salt and water retention and increase lithium concentration. Ramipril and losartan can lead to increased Lithium concentration and thus toxicity. Amlodipine can also increase the concentration.
cardiovascular system,259,A 66 year old male with a history of AF on aspirin and bisoprolol presents with symptoms of TIAs.  An ECHO and a CT Head do not reveal any abnormalities.  How would you manage this patient?,Warfarin,Nil,Carotid endarterectomy,Digoxin,Clopidogrel,A,"This patient is developing TIAs.  On a background of AF this may be due to embolus and thus if there is no major contraindications then the patient should be fully anti-coagulated with warfarin.  Previous recommendations say unless contraindicated patients with a history of previous stroke/TIA/thromboembolic event, those over 75 with hypertension, diabetes or vascular disease or those with evidence of valve disease or LVSD should be warfarinised although some suggest now it should be considered in all patients.  Endarterectomy is utilised in those with significant carotid artery stenosis.  Clopidogrel is not indicated in this case."
cardiovascular system,260,Which one of the following is an inappropriate site for arterial cannulation?,Axillary artery,Brachial artery,Dorsalis pedis artery,Femoral artery,Radial artery,B,"Commonly used sites for the insertion of arterial cannulae include the radial, femoral, axillary and dorsalis pedis arteries. Short catheters should be used for the radial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Longer, softer and more flexible cannulae should be used for the femoral and axillary arteries (to minimise injury). The brachial artery should be avoided because the collateral circulation is limited."
cardiovascular system,261,A 55-year-old woman suffered from an acute MI 5 days ago. While she was in the hospital the patient developed features of pulmonary edema and heart failure. What is the most probable cause of her present condition?,VSD,Ruptured papillary muscle,Pericarditis,A-fib,Re-infarction,B,Post MI rupture of papillary muscl is responsible for valve failure (mitral regurgitation) causing pulmonary oedema and heart failure
cardiovascular system,262,"A 19-year-old woman presents to the clinic having had five blackouts over the last year, all while she is standing up. She gets warnings of blurred vision, nausea, and feeling hot. She has been witnessed twice to have jerking of all limbs while she is unconscious. The attacks last 30 to 60 seconds. She recovers quickly after the attacks. She has never bitten her tongue or sustained any injuries. Physical examination and an ECG are normal. Her grandmother and sister suffer from epilepsy. Which of the following investigations is the most appropriate?",24 hour ECG recording,CT brain,ECHO,EEG,Tilt table test,E,"The most likely diagnosis is vasovagal syncope. The gradual onset of the attack is typical. It is common for patients with syncope to have jerking of their limbs while they are unconscious. Warning symptoms of darkening/blurring of vision, dizziness and feeling hot are characteristic in syncope. Patients usually recover very quickly after the event. Tilt table test is a useful test to support the diagnosis of vasovagal syncope. "
cardiovascular system,263,A 68-year-old woman with atrial fibrillation (AF) is admitted for DC cardioversion. The procedure resulted in successful restoration of sinus rhythm. Which one of the following drugs would be most likely to maintain sinus rhythm following this procedure?,Amiodarone,Digoxin,Diltiazem,Sotalol,Verapamil,A,"Amiodarone has been shown to be superior in maintaining sinus rhythm following DC cardioversion of AF, however, it is associated with more toxic side effects than the other agents mentioned. Neither verapamil, diltiazem nor digoxin would be expected to maintain sinus rhythm to any significant extent. Sotalol may be considered as a possible therapy but is less effective than amiodarone."
cardiovascular system,264,How should  a patient with unstable preexcited atrial fibrillation secondary to Wolff parkinson white be managed?,Adenosine,DC Cardioversion,Digoxin,Verapamil,Atenolol,B,Preexcited atrial fibrillation should be managed with DC cardioversion.  Adenosine can block the AV node and lead to a paradoxic increase in the ventricular rate as can beta blockers.  Digoxin and verapamil should be avoided as they may allow a higher rate of conduction over the aberrant pathway.
cardiovascular system,265,"A previously well 27-year-old woman presents with a history of transient ischaemic attack affecting her right side and speech. She had returned to the United Kingdom from a holiday in New Zealand two days previously. On examination there was nothing abnormal to find. An ECG, chest x ray, CT brain scan, and routine haematology and biochemistry were all normal. Which is the most likely underlying abnormality?",Atrial myxoma,Carotid artery stenosis,Embolus from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation,Patent foramen ovale,Subarachnoid haemorrhage,D,"Whilst you would expect to find leg swelling with a DVT, its absence does not preclude the diagnosis. There is no evidence of subarachnoid haemorrhage here, and carotid artery stenosis is rare in someone so young. Paroxysmal AF is a possibility, but you are given no history of palpitations. Whilst data from autopsy shows atrial myxoma to be present in 1 to 30 in 100,000, in clinical practice they are incredibly rare. Therefore DVT with PFO (resulting in paradoxical embolus) is the most likely diagnosis, especially in the setting of recent immobility."
cardiovascular system,266,"A 49-year-old woman comes to the clinic complaining of rapidly worsening lethargy and nausea. Over the past few days she has become increasingly unwell and is now barely able to get out of the house. Other symptoms of note include progressive shortness of breath and a cough productive of blood stained sputum. Her only consultations with the doctor over the past six months have been about the shape of her nose; she has suffered some collapse of her nasal bridge and is considering plastic surgery. On examination you notice collapse of the bridge of her nose, and nasal congestion when she speaks. Her BP is elevated at 155/95 mmHg. You can hear crepitations on auscultation of the chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (115-165)   White cell count 11.6 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 202 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 5.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 285 µmol/L (79-118)   CXR Patchy interstitial shadowing   C-ANCA Positive    Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?",Infliximab,Methylprednisolone and azathioprine,Methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide,Methylprednisolone and methotrexate,Prednisolone,C,"Methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide is the treatment of choice for induction of remission in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the obvious diagnosis here. Evidence from controlled trials suggests that once remission is achieved, azathioprine or methotrexate may be reasonable alternatives to cyclophosphamide. In refractory Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, both infliximab and rituximab have shown some degree of promise. Prognosis is dependent on prompt diagnosis and early intervention with immunosuppressive therapies, with evidence suggesting that time to diagnosis has shortened over the past few years."
cardiovascular system,267,A 75-year-old lady attends the Emergency Department with dizziness and fainting. She has fully recovered. Neurological examination is normal. Carotid scanning shows stenosis of 80% on the right and 90% on the left. Which of the following is the best course of action?,Bilateral carotid endarterectomy,Discharge and GP follow up,Discharge and outpatient follow up,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the left,Urgent carotid endarterectomy on the right,C,"This lady has presented with vague symptoms, and does not have any residual neurology on examination. It is possible this presentation has been caused by a posterior circulation transient ischaemic attack, but it could also have been due to a vasovagal or postural hypotension. Dizziness can be a feature of posterior circulation strokes. Other features are:  cranial nerve palsies unilateral or bilateral motor/sensory deficits nystagmus, and cerebellar dysfunction.  Anterior circulation strokes result in higher dysfunction (dysphasia, visuospatial disturbances, decreased consciousness), homonymous hemianopia, and motor and sensory deficits. Investigations here have demonstrated significant carotid artery disease, but as this classically results in anterior circulation symptoms it is unlikely this has caused the symptoms in this case. The advice regarding management of asymptomatic severe carotid artery disease varies, and it would be prudent in this situation to arrange timely outpatient review with a specialist to discuss this."
cardiovascular system,268,A 54-year-old man is found to have a prolonged corrected QT interval on his ECG. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause?,Cefaclor,Digoxin,Moxonidine,Sotalol,Telmisartan,D,"The following are causes of drug-induced long QT:  Sotalol Amiodarone Class 1a antiarrhythmic drugs Tricyclic antidepressants Chloroquine, and Terfenadine."
cardiovascular system,269,Which of the following compounds has a vasodilating effect?,Antidiuretic hormone (ADH),Calcitonin gene related peptide,Endothelin,Renin,Somatostatin,B,Calcitonin gene related peptide causes vasodilatation. ADH acts on the vasopressor receptors to cause vasoconstriction. Endothelin is also a vasoconstrictor. Renin breaks down angiotensinogen to angiotensin 1 and via ACE to angiotensin 2 which causes vasoconstriction Somatostatin is also recognised to produce vasoconstriction of the splanchnic system. 
cardiovascular system,270,A patient presents bradycardic and she is haemodynamically unstable. It is thought to be related to a beta blocker overdose. She is given IV fluids and atropine with no response. Which of the following should be utilised?,Temporary cardiac pacing,Adenosine,Haemodialysis,Insulin,Glucagon,E,"Glucagon can increase myocardial contraction, heart rate and AV conduction and many feel it is the drug of choice. Cardiac pacing is reserved for those who feel medical management. Haemodialysis may be useful for atenolol overdoses. High dose insulin has been shown to be useful in a few case reports but should always be discussed with a specialist. Adenosine is used in the management of SVTs and must be avoided."
cardiovascular system,271,Which of the following is correct regarding pulse oximetry?,Has a linear relationship between the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) and percentage oxygen saturation (%SaO2),Is unaffected by the carboxyhaemoglobin level,Is unreliable when used on the same side as the blood pressure cuff,Oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the left by hyperthermia,Readings which are low usually result from problems with the device and not usually the patient,C,"Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method of assessing arterial oxygen saturation and heart rate. Any cause of poor peripheral perfusion causes unreliable readings, including external compression by a blood pressure cuff. Though there may be mechanical causes for poor pulse oximetry readings you should always look for a physiological cause first. For example, vasoconstriction is one of the first compensatory mechanisms employed by the body following blood loss. In these situations it is often helpful to check pulse rate in comparison to the electrocardiogram (ECG). Other causes of error include abnormal pigments such as bilirubin, methaemoglobin and carboxyhaemoglobin. Jaundice underestimates the actual oxygen saturation, whereas carbon monoxide poisoning overestimates the level of saturation. When the partial pressure of oxygen is plotted against percentage saturation, a sigmoidal curve is produced. The middle range of the curve is therefore particularly important as small changes in partial pressure will cause large changes in saturation. Certain factors may result in 'shifts' in the curve. The following cause a right shift in the curve:  reduced pH increased temperature partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and 2-3 diphosphoglycerates.  This means that haemoglobin gives up oxygen more easily to the tissues. "
cardiovascular system,272,Which of the following is not a component of the cardiac electrical conduction pathway?,Atrioventricular node,Bundle of His,Purkinje fibres,Sarcomere,Sinoatrial node,D,"To enable the circulation of blood through the heart, and through the body, the heart requires coordinated muscular contraction. This is made possible because of the electrical conduction pathway of the heart. An understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the conducting system is important to allow the interpretation of ECGs and the diagnosis of arrhythmias. The electrical signal starts off at the sinoatrial node (SAN); it then passes to the atrioventricular node (AVN) depolarising the left and right atrium whilst it passes through, thus enabling contraction. At the atrioventricular node, a short delay occurs, allowing the atrium to start relaxing, before the impulse travels down the bundle of His, and divides along the left and right bundle branches, where it causes depolarisation of the right and left ventricles, and thus ventricular contraction. Once the atrium and ventricle have repolarised, the cycle starts anew.   Sinoatrial node Atrioventricular node Bundle of His Left bundle branch Left posterior fascicle Left anterior fascicle Left ventricle. Ventricular Septum Right Ventricle Right Bundle Branch"
cardiovascular system,273,Which of the following is the most common complication of coronary angiography?,Cholesterol Embolisation,Contrast nephropathy,Vascular complications,Myocardial Infarction,Stroke,C,"Bleeding, haematoma and difficult access are among the most common complications."
cardiovascular system,274,Which of the following is the most likely finding on an ECG in a patient with a Pulmonary Embolus?,S1Q3T3,Left bundle branch block,T wave inversion V1-V3,Right bundle branch block,Sinus Tahcycardia,E,Although the classical finding on ECG of a PE is S1Q3T3 this is rare and the most common finding is Sinus Tachycardia.
cardiovascular system,275,"A 50 year old gentleman presents with central chest pain with associated autonomic features. He looks grey and clammy and on auscultation his heart sounds are normal but there is bibasal crackles. His heart rate is 80 bpm and his blood pressure is 103/60 mm Hg. His ECG revealed ST elevation V1 to V4 and ST depression II, II and aVF. He is referred for Primary PCI. What is likely to be found at angiography?",80 per cent stenosis of left circumflex artery,Complete occlusion of right coronary artery,Vasospasm,Complete occlusion of left anterior descending artery,70 per cent stenosis of left anterior descending artery,D,"In this case there is an anterior MI and the most likely artery to be affected is the left anterior descending artery. The lateral leads are I, aVL and V5 to V6. The Inferior leads II, III and aVF would likely show changes if there was right coronary occlusion. Similarly circumflex artery occlusion would likely show lateral changes."
cardiovascular system,276,A 56-year-old woman presents to the cardiology clinic with increasing attacks of syncope and pre-syncope over the past few months. She is worried that she may have an underlying cardiac defect. She has a 72 hour ECG recording. Which of the following would be the most significant finding on 72 hour tape?,"1,000 atrial ectopics recorded over the 72 hours","1,000 ventricular ectopics recorded over the 72 hours",Bradycardia of 40 bpm whilst asleep,Mobitz type 1 heart block with right bundle branch block (RBBB) whilst feeling lightheaded,Runs of four to six beats of SVT without symptoms,D,"Second degree heart block with RBBB implies that this patient has a significantly increased risk of complete heart block. Runs of four to six beats of SVT, and atrial and ventricular ectopics at this rate would be seen as insignificant. Ultimately, prior to committing to pace maker insertion, repeat tape is the most likely next step, with an electronic patient diary to see if the recorded arrhythmia corresponds to her symptoms. "
cardiovascular system,277,"A 65 year old male has a history of ischaemic heart disease and mitral regurgitation. He undergoes insertion of a permanent pacemaker for sick sinus syndrome. A few hours later you are called as he has become agitated and very short of breath. On examination he is tachycardic, hypotensive and tachypnoeic. His heart sounds are quiet and his hands are cold and clammy and there is evidence of a raised JVP and bibasal crackles. An ECG shows small QRS complexes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic Dissection,Myocardial Infarction,Pericarditis,Acute worsening of mitral regurgitation,Cardiac tamponade,E,Given the history of permanent pacemaker insertion and the finding of raised JVP and hypotension the most likely diagnosis is cardiac tamponade. Aortic dissection could lead to cardiac tamponade however is not likely given the intervention performed. An acute worsening of his mitral regurgitation is unlikely. The ECG findings are not inkeeping with pericarditis.
cardiovascular system,278,"Your next patient in the care of the elderly clinic is a 79-year-old lady who you initially saw two months ago with a history of palpitations. She has a history of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and controlled hypertension on bendroflumethiazide. She remains active and lives alone independently. When you saw her last you sent her for an echo. This demonstrates good LV function, mild concentric LVH and a dilated LA (AP diameter 5.7 cm). A 24 hour ECG has shown AF throughout, maximal rate 135. On questioning during this consultation she has noted a few episodes of palpitations lasting a few hours. Today her ECG confirms AF. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management of her arrhythmia?",Arrange DC cardioversion,Start amiodarone,Start bisoprolol,Start digoxin,Start sotalol,C,"This question tests knowledge of the recommended initial strategy for patients with AF (that is, rhythm or rate control). The decision to start either strategy is based on symptoms and other clinical features. This patient should be offered rate control in the first instance because she is older (greater than65), has a history of CAD and has a large left atrium (greater than5.5 cm) which makes cardioversion less likely to be successful. Initial treatment for a rate control strategy is either a standard beta blocker (that is, bisoprolol) or calcium channel blocker. Digoxin should only be used first line for patients who are predominantly sedentary or hypotensive. Therefore the correct choice is start bisoprolol. The patient should also be considered for anti-coagulation based on her CHADS2 score. "
cardiovascular system,279,In most cardiac arrest situations 1 mg of adrenaline (epinephrine) is given intravenously every three minutes. What is the correct volume and concentration of the adrenaline?,0.1 ml of 1 in 100,1 ml of 1 in 1000,"1 ml of 1 in 10,000",10 ml of 1 in 1000,"10 ml of 1 in 10,000",E,"A 1 mg dose of adrenaline (epinephrine) would be administered with 0.1 ml of 1 in 100, 1 ml of 1 in 1000 and 10 ml of 1 in 10,000. However, 10 ml of 1 in 10,000 is the recommended dose and concentration and is considered the optimum volume of adrenaline during cardiac arrest, and is recommended by the UK Resuscitation Council.

cardiovascular system,280,"A 42-year-old lady had corrective surgery for cyanotic congenital heart disease at the age of 3y, after a palliative operation during infancy. There is a parasternal impulse and an early diastolic murmur. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Aortic regurgitation,Ischemic mitral regurgitation,Aortic stenosis,Pulmonary stenosis,Pulmonary regurgitation,E,"In the present day, some patients with tetralogy of Fallot have survived for longer than 15-20 years after their first operation. The major problem encountered by these individuals is the development of pulmonary valvular regurgitation. It appears that a number of these individuals require pulmonary valve replacement"
cardiovascular system,281,Which of the following suggests more severe mitral regurgitation?,Split S2,Length of murmur,Loudness of murmur,Soft S1,Displacement of apex beat and systolic thrill,E,"As mitral regurgitation becomes more severe, the left ventricle enlarges and the apex beat displaces and a systolic thrill can develop."
cardiovascular system,282,"A 70-year-old male was receiving amiodarone 200 mg daily for intermittent atrial fibrillation. However, he was aware of tiredness and lethargy. He appeared clinically euthyroid with no palpable goitre. Investigations revealed:    Serum free T4 23pmol/L (9-26)   Serum total T3 0.8 nmol/L (0.9-2.8)   Serum TSH 8.2 mU/L (less than5)    Which of the following statements would explain these results?",Abnormal thyroxine binding globulin,Amiodarone induced hypothyroidism,'Sick euthyroid' syndrome,Spontaneous hypothyroidism,TSH secreting pituitary adenoma,B,"The results show normal thyroxine (T4), low triiodothyronine (T3), with elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). These results are typical of amiodarone induced hypothyroidism which inhibits the peripheral conversion of T4 to T3.] Abnormal thyroxine binding globulin can be due to hypithyroidisism but is not specific and assoicated with pregnancy and liver disease also.  A TSH secreting pituitary adenoma would cause supression of both T3 and T4 and the clinical history does not fit here.  Spontaneous hypothyroidism is possible however clinical symptoms or a goitre would more likley be present."
cardiovascular system,283,An 86-year-old man sees you in clinic. He is a keen marathon runner and tells you that he gets breathless much earlier on in a race than he did 10 years ago. Which physiological change associated with age would be the most likely cause of his symptoms?,Diastolic dysfunction and reduced stroke volume,Higher systolic arterial pressure and increased impedance to left ventricular ejection,Increased sino-atrial conduction time,Left ventricular hypertrophy,Reduced tachycardic response,E,"Reduced tachycardic response is the correct answer. There is a reduced tachycardic response during exercise associated with age. The heart has to compensate by increasing stroke volume and failure to do so will reduce aerobic capacity. Some fit, healthy, elderly men can compensate for this by increasing left ventricular filling and thus stroke volume (Starling's law). The other answer options are all physiological changes associated with age. They occur, irrespective of whether a patient exercises or not. The symptoms that this patient describes are during exercise and failure of the heart to respond appropriately to exercise by increasing the heart rate will lead to dyspnoea. "
cardiovascular system,284,"A 60-year-old man has a three month history of worsening dyspnoea. He has been healthy all his life with no major illnesses. His blood pressure is 118/92 mmHg, he has a murmur, and has audible crackles at both bases. His serum glucose is 5.6 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). His total serum cholesterol is 4.8 mmol/L (less than5.2). The serum creatine kinase is not elevated. Which is the most likely explanation for these findings?",Alcoholic cardiomyopathy,Aortic dissection,Calcified bicuspid aortic valve,Mitral valve annulus calcification,Tricuspid valve endocarditis,C,"The clinical signs point to a left sided heart failure which would discount alcoholic cardiomyopathy as it would be biventricular and tricuspid valve endocarditis, which would be right sided. There are no acute symptoms and the history is not sudden to suggest aortic dissection. Mitral valve calcification is an incidental finding at echocardiography (ECHO). This leaves a calcified bicuspid aortic valve leading to aortic stenosis as the likely explanation."
cardiovascular system,285,"A 17-year-old female is found to have a cardiac murmur characterized by a mid-systolic click. An echocardiogram reveals mitral insufficiency with upward displacement of one leaflet. There is also aortic root dilation to 4 cm. She has a dislocated right ocular crystalline lens. She dies suddenly and unexpectedly. The medical examiner finds a prolapsed mitral valve with elongation, thinning, and rupture of chordae tendineae. A mutation involving which of the following genes is most likely have be present in this patient?",Beta-myosin,CFTR,FGFR,Fibrillin,Spectrin,D,"Marfan's syndrome is a connective tissue disorder that is associated with floppy mitral valve and also with cystic medial necrosis that predisposes to aortic dissection. Abnormalities of the beta myosin gene may be associated with some forms of dilated cardiomyopathy. The CFTR gene is associated with cystic fibrosis. The obstructive lung disease from widespread bronchiectasis that results from cystic fibrosis involving the lung can lead to pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale. The fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) gene mutations can be associated with skeletal dysplasias. The spectrin gene mutation can be associated with red cell membrane abnormalities associated with hereditary spherocytosis. Anemias in adults with this condition are not typically severe, though anemias in general can increase cardiac stress."
cardiovascular system,286,A 45-year-old lady has 10 months history of shortness of breath. She is found to have irregularly irregular pulse and loud P2 with fixed splitting and ejection systolic murmur in left 2nd intercostal space. What is the probable diagnosis?,TOF,ASD,VSD,PDA,CoA,B,"Most adult patients with a large defect present with (some or all) symptoms including fatigue, exercise intolerance, palpitations, syncope, shortness of breath, peripheral oedema, thromboembolic manifestations, and cyanosis. Arrhythmias are more common after 40 years of age. The common arrhythmias are atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation. Auscultatory findings are: Loud P2 with fixed splitting of 2nd heart sound. A left-to-right shunt caused increased loading on the right ventricle, leading to delayed emptying and therefore delayed closure of the pulmonary valve which caused this splitting. Soft systolic ejection murmur in the pulmonary area at the upper left sternal border. A diastolic rumble over the left lower sternum because of increased flow through the tricuspid valve. Classic auscultatory findings as described above are not present unless the shunt is reasonably large"
cardiovascular system,287,A 76-year-old man is admitted for mitral valve replacement surgery. Which of the following statements is true of the mitral valve?,Also known as the tricuspid valve,Composed of three semilunar cusps,Found on the right side of the heart,Has cusps attached to chordae tendineae,Open during ventricular systole,D,The mitral valve or bicuspid valve is a flat valve composed of anterior and posterior cusps. It guards the passage of blood from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The cusps are attached to chordae tendineae which are then attached to papillary muscles that prevent cusp eversion during ventricular systole. It opens during diastole. Referencing 
cardiovascular system,288,A 75-year-old man is admitted to hospital with acute coronary syndrome and is diagnosed with a myocardial infarction (MI). Four days later he develops a further episode of chest pain with non-specific ST-T wave changes on the ECG. Which of the following cardiac enzymes would be the most appropriate for deciding if this second episode was a further MI?,AST,CK-MB,LDH,Troponin I,Troponin T,B,"Troponin T remains elevated for ten days following an MI so a second episode of chest pain within that time, suspicious of MI, needs to be evaluated with creatine kinase (CK)-myoglobin (MB) which rises over three days to form a diagnostic profile."
cardiovascular system,289,Which of the following mechanisms best explains the action of OMACOR (omega-3-acid ethyl esters)?,Activation of PPAR-alpha,Bile acid sequestration,Decreases hepatic cholesterol synthesis,Increases peroxisomomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids,Inhibits cholesterol absorption,D,"Omacor reduces triglycerides by different, independent effects in the liver. The synthesis of triglycerides is inhibited through reduced production of triglycerides in the liver, as EPA and DHA are poor substrates for the enzymes responsible for triglyceride synthesis. EPA and DHA also inhibit esterification of other fatty acids. Omacor increases peroxisomomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver. "
cardiovascular system,290,A 68 year old has been commenced on an antihypertensive medication. She is now complaining of ankle swelling. Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause?,Bendroflumethiazide,Amlodipine,Furosemide,Atenolol,Ramipril,B,Calcium channel blockers are one of the first line antihypertensives and can lead to ankle swelling.
cardiovascular system,291,"A 65-year-old man is admitted to the coronary care unit with an acute inferior myocardial infarction (MI). There are no contraindications to thrombolysis and he receives streptokinase with good resolution of ECG changes. Three days later examination is normal, with a blood pressure of 134/76 mmHg. Results reveal a total cholesterol of 4.8 mmol/L (less than5.2). Which one of the following drugs does not have good evidence for reducing future morbidity and mortality?",Aspirin,Atenolol,Nifedipine,Ramipril,Simvastatin,C,"Aspirin leads to a 12% reduced risk of death and 31% reduced risk of reinfarction in evidence reviewed by the antiplatelet therapy trialists and also GISSI studies. Several trials have demonstrated benefit from long term treatment with beta blockers, by reducing the incidence of recurrent MI, and death from all causes. Numerous trials have shown benefit from angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy post MI in those with and without evidence of left ventricular impairment. The 4S (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study) demonstrated a benefit from lowering cholesterol with simvastatin in patients with coronary disease^1. There is no evidence to support a beneficial effect of nifedipine post- MI. "
cardiovascular system,292,A new antihypertensive drug needs to be investigated to establish its relative potency. Which of the following techniques is most appropriate for this purpose?,Bioassay,Case-control study,"Double blind, randomised, placebo controlled study",Postmarketing surveillance,Sequential trial,A,"Biological assays are designed to measure the relative potency of different preparations. Blood pressure is highly variable and is subject to variability because of the patient's level of anxiety and the method used by the observer to measure it. In a test of efficacy of an antihypertensive drug, a double blind, randomised design would be favourable. A sequential trial (a trial in which the data are analysed after each participant's results become available and the trial continues until a clear benefit is seen in one of the comparison groups) could also be used to assess efficacy, but there would have to be a large expected difference from placebo."
cardiovascular system,293,A 29-year-old motorcyclist is brought to the emergency department after he was involved in a high speed road traffic accident on the motorway. He was thrown off his bike onto the road. Severe bruising is noticed over his left antero-lateral chest wall. There is decreased air entry over the left lower lobe of lung and bowel sounds are heard in the chest. A chest x ray reveals fracture of the lower four ribs on the left side and a raised left dome of the diaphragm. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Cardiac tamponade,Diaphragmatic rupture,Left lung contusion,Tension pneumothorax,Traumatic haemothorax,B,"This patient is most likely to have a ruptured diaphragm. Direct penetrating injury to the thoraco-abdominal region is a common cause for diaphragmatic rupture. The injury could be at any level between the fourth and the tenth inter-costal space, depending on the patient's respiratory pattern. The other causes include rib fractures and a sudden increase in thoraco-abdominal pressure, as may occur when a patient with a closed glottis is hit in the abdomen. The diaphragmatic rupture may present with signs and symptoms of cardiac and pulmonary compromise. The patient may or may not be haemodynamically compromised. Diaphragmatic rupture may be difficult to detect clinically, and thus may result in significant morbidity or sometimes mortality. Rupture may be seen on plain chest radiograph especially with the abnormal location of the naso-gastric tube; the accuracy of this method, however, is modest. The differential diagnoses for a raised left hemidiaphragm, both clinically and in plain radiography, include:  Phrenic nerve palsy Atelectasis Diaphragmatic hernia, and Distended abdominal viscera.  Helical CT scan and multi-section CT scan identify most injuries in the trauma setting; they are thus the investigations of choice. MR scanning, although very sensitive and specific, is not feasible in most trauma situations. However, they remain a useful tool to in stable patients to make a more accurate diagnosis and to delineate precisely the extent of anatomical damage. An exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopy may be necessary to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture. Diaphragmatic injury, secondary to high-impact trauma such as RTAs, is associated with a high proportion of associated injuries to the pelvis, thorax and abdomen, and to other visceral organs such as the lung, heart, spleen and liver. Thus a high index of suspicion should be maintained in patients with diaphragmatic injury, and injury to other anatomical structures and organs should be identified and treated."
cardiovascular system,294,"A 23 year old is brought to A+E following an assault where he was stabbed in the chest. He was complaining of chest pain. He is now tachycardic and hypotensive. He has muffled heart sounds, raised JVP and pulsus paradoxus. Respiratory examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pulmonary embolus,Cardiogenic shock,Cardiac tamponade,Tension pneumothorax,Constrictive pericarditis,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Cardiac tamponade. Becks triad of hyotension, raised JVP and muffled heart sounds is evident and is highly sugesstive along with the history of trauma. Pulsus paradoxus is whereby systolic pressure pressure reduces in inspiration by > 10 mmHg and is seen in cardiac tamponade. Given the suddeness of the symptoms constrictive pericarditis and cardiogenic shock are unlikely. Respiratory examination is normal thus tension pneumothorax is excluded."
cardiovascular system,295,"A 45-year-old man who is diabetic and hypertensive but poorly compliant has chronic SOB (Shortness Of Breath), develops severe SOB and chest pain. Pain is sharp, increased by breathing and relieved by sitting forward. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?",MI,Pericarditis,Lung cancer,Good pastures syndrome,Progressive massive fibrosis,B,"Nature of pain i.e. sharp pain increased by breathing and relieved by sitting forward is suggestive of pericarditis.Nature of pericardial pain: the most common symptom is sharp, stabbing chest pain behind the sternum or in the left side of your chest. However, some people with acute pericarditis describe their chest pain as dull, achy or pressure-like instead, and of varying intensity.The pain of acute pericarditis may radiate to your left shoulder and neck. It often intensifies when you cough, lie down or inhale deeply. Sitting up and leaning forward can often ease the pain"
cardiovascular system,296,A 55-year-old female who received radioactive iodine over five years ago presents for annual thyroid function assessment. She is well and takes no medication. Her results reveal:    Free Thyroxine 13.2 pmol/L (10-22)   TSH 16 mU/L (0.4-5)   Total cholesterol 6.8 mmol/L (less than5.2)   Plasma triglycerides 2.2 mmol/L (0.45-1.69)    Which is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's dyslipidaemia?,Cholestyramine,Fibrate therapy,Hormone replacement therapy,Statin therapy,Thyroxine,E,This patient has subclinical hypothyroidism as reflected by the normal thyroxine (T4) but elevated thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). A hypercholesterolaemia with hypertriglyceridaemia is frequently associated due to impaired lipoprotein lipase function. The dyslipidaemia may well resolve following the appropriate replacement with thyroxine.
cardiovascular system,297,"A 68 year old asthmatic presents with shortness of breath. She also has a PMH of hypertension for which she is prescribed ramipril. On examination she is found to have a BP of 130/80mmHg, pulse of 90 irregularly, irregular and bilateral wheeze and normal heart sounds. A CXR reveals cardiomegaly. What is the most appropriate treatment of her AF?",Atenolol,Flecainide,Verapamil,Amiodarone,Digoxin,E,Rate control is the most appropriate in this case. Digoxin should be utilised due to the cardiomegaly and history of asthma which means verapamil and atenolol should be avoided due to potential of precipitating heart failure and worsening asthma respectively.
cardiovascular system,298,"A 44-year-old man has had no major medical problems throughout his life, except for arthritis pain involving all extremities for the past couple of years. He has had worsening orthopnoea and ankle oedema in the past six months. He is afebrile. There is no chest pain. A chest x ray shows cardiomegaly with both enlarged left and right heart borders, along with pulmonary oedema.

Hereditary haemochromatosis (HHC) is suspected with a serum ferritin greater than 1000 and confirmed by genetic testing. Other things to consider are a raised transferrin saturation greater than 45% suggetsing iron overload as well as signs and symptoms of clincal iron overload such as jaundice or signs of diabetes. Hereditary haemochromatosis is characterised by diabetes, congestive cardiac failure (CCF), pseudogout, and slate-grey skin.  andquot;HHC is an autosomal recessive condition and in 90% of cases in the United Kingdom (UK) the condition is owing to homozygosity for the C282Y mutation in the HFE gene. A second mutation in the HFE gene, H63D, can cause the disease when in the presence of a single C282Y mutation (the so-called 'compound heterozygote' state). These mutations are common in people of Northern European origin with a carrier frequency of the C282Y mutation of one in 10-17, in the UK, suggesting a prevalence of people homozygous for the C282Y mutation of between one in 100 and one in 280. If HHC becomes symptomatic by mid-life, a general practitioner (GP) with a list size of 2,000 patients should have approximately four cases. In our experience most GPs claim to have never seen a case. Herein lies the conundrum: is HHC far more common than is currently recorded in clinical records and death registers because it is not being diagnosed, or does significant disease not develop in a large proportion of C282Y homozygotes and compound heterozygotes?andquot;^1  "
cardiovascular system,299,A 16-year-old profoundly deaf boy on holiday in the United Kingdom from Denmark presents with recurrent episodes of syncope and is found to have a long QT interval on his ECG. His faxed medical records indicate that he has Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. Which of the following genes is affected in this condition?,CACNA1c gene,Caveolin 3 related gene,Human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG),KCNQ1 gene,SCN5A gene,D,"Mutations in the KCNE1 and KCNQ1 genes cause Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome. The KCNE1 and KCNQ1 genes provide instructions for making proteins that work together to form a channel across cell membranes. These channels transport positively charged potassium atoms (ions) out of cells. The movement of potassium ions through these channels is critical for maintaining the normal functions of inner ear structures and cardiac muscle. All the other genes mentioned are associated with long QT syndromes. The human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) is the gene affected by drugs that lengthen QT interval inadvertently; erythromycin, terfenadine, and ketoconazole. "

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Familial combined hyperlipidaemia,Familial hypercholesterolaemia,Familial hypertriglyceridaemia,Hyperlipidaemia associated with nephrotic syndrome,Remnant hyperlipidaemia,C,Eruptive xanthoma occur in a number of types of hypertriglyceridaemia and also in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Of those listed the most likely is familial hypertriglyceridaemia. 
cardiovascular system,301,"A 62-year-old male undergoes cardioversion for idiopathic atrial fibrillation (AF). Post-procedure he was shown to be in sinus rhythm. Medication at admission included warfarin, digoxin and atenolol, which he had been taking for the last six weeks. Which of the following agents should he continue to take until he is seen in clinic in six weeks time?",Aspirin,Atenolol,Digoxin,Sotalol,Warfarin,E,"This patient has undergone successful cardioversion for idiopathic AF and needs to remain on warfarin as his risk of further thromboembolism, due to the fact that his atria are now contracting, normally remains high up until six -eight weeks after achieving sinus rhythm. New guideance suggest that the use of direct oral anticoagulants such as apixiban instead of warfarin can be used and this is more common practice now than warfarin. Digoxin is not required post-procedure as neither it, nor atenolol, maintains sinus rhythm. Aspirin is not as good as warfarin in preventing thromboembolic disease. Sotalol, like amiodarone, is good at chemical cardioversion and maintaining SR but its role post-cardioversion is uncertain.   "
cardiovascular system,302,"A 52-year-old male attends a well man clinic. On review of his history he has a strong family history of ischaemic heart disease and is a smoker of 10 cigarettes per day and drinks approximately 20 units of alcohol per week. On examination, he is obese with a BMI of 32 kg/m^2 and has a blood pressure of 152/88 mmHg. His investigations reveal that he has a fasting plasma glucose of 10.5 mmol/L (3.0-6.0), HbA1c of 62 mmol/mol (20-46) and his cholesterol concentration is 5.5 mmol/L (less than5.2). Which of the following would be expected to be most effective in reducing his cardiovascular (CV) risk?",Improve glycaemic control with metformin,Improve hypertensive control with ramipril,Reduce cholesterol with simvastatin,Stop smoking,Weight loss with Xenical,D,"This patient has hypertension and diabetes as suggested by the elevated fasting plasma glucose. Although metformin has been shown to reduce CV mortality in obese diabetics^1, ramipril reduces CV risk in hypertensive diabetics^2 and statins reduce CV mortality^3,4, none of these interventions is as effective as stopping smoking in reducing CV risk. The best evidence is from The Nurses' Health Study^5 which looked at the risk in 'past smokers' and 'current smokers' in women. In men there is less definitive evidence as the MRFIT trial did not specifically look at past smokers only baseline smoking status. Despite this lack of explicit evidence it is unlikely that many practitioners would consider the other interventions of relatively more benefit than smoking cessation. There is no evidence that weight loss per se reduces CV mortality, possibly because the studies have not been done. "
cardiovascular system,303,"A 50-year-old man came to the hospital a few months after he had a MI. Examination: everything normal, S1 and S2 were heard on auscultation, but there is a new pan-sytolic murmur. What is the most appropriate investigation of choice?",ECG,24h ECG,Echo,CXR,CT,C,To rule out any valvular lesion (following papillary muscle rupture) or septal lesion
cardiovascular system,304,An ECG shows regular broad complex tachycardia. There was evidence on the ECG of one fusion and one capture beat. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Ventricular fibrillation,Atrial flutter,Supraventricular tachycardia with aberrant conduction,Atrial fibrillation,Ventricular Tachycardia,E,The two diagnoses you would consider here is ventricular tachycardia and SVT with aberrant conduction. The hint that this is VT is the presence of capture and fusion beats which are not featured in SVT with aberrant conduction.
cardiovascular system,305,"A 72-year-old man with a history of oesophageal carcinoma is recovering on the surgical ward after oesophagogastrectomy. You are asked to see him because he has developed worsening central chest pain, looks pale and sweaty, and has dropped his blood pressure to 100/55 mmHg with a pulse of 92. He has bibasal crackles on auscultation of the chest. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 108 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 9.0 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 180 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 145 μmol/L (60-120)   ECG Anterior ST elevation consistent with acute MI    Which of the following is the most appropriate management?",Angioplasty,"Aspirin, clopidogrel, and low molecular weight heparin","Aspirin, clopidogrel, low molecular weight heparin, and abciximab",CABG,Thrombolysis,A,"Thrombolysis is contraindicated in this gentleman due to his recent surgery, and anti-platelet therapy with or without IIb3a inhibitor will provide limited advantage in a man with a STEMI, while simultaneously increasing his risk of significant bleeding so soon after surgery. As such, there is only one logical management plan for him: to consider angioplasty. Evidence suggests angioplasty is superior to thrombolysis in the general population, and as such, this man should be managed aggressively and transferred to the catheter lab as soon as is practicable."
cardiovascular system,306,A 23-year-old man attended his local NHS walk-in centre with a history of chest pains. The doctor arranged a 12 lead ECG which he is surprised to find suggests left ventricular hypertrophy. The doctor decides to refer the patient to the local acute medical department. The patient is admitted and the next day has a transthoracic echocardiogram. This demonstrates asymmetric septal hypertrophy with a small LV cavity. Systolic function appears normal. The cardiologist explains the diagnosis of probable hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. On the ward round the next day the patient is worried about the associated risk of death. Which of the features listed is a recognised risk factor for sudden cardiac death?,Atrial fibrillation,Drop in systolic blood pressure of 25 mmHg on exercise,Mitral regurgitation,Older age at diagnosis,Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets,B,"Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise is a marker for increased risk of sudden cardiac death in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is often asymptomatic and is noticed following routine ECGs or echocardiograms for other reasons. HCM is a complex disease and there is a wide variability in severity and risk of serious complications (mainly ventricular arrhythmias). Unfortunately, risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is difficult to predict but there are recognised risk factors. Younger age at diagnosis and non-sustained VT are markers of risk. Abnormal blood pressure response to exercise is a marker for risk of SCD."
cardiovascular system,307,A 58-year-old type 1 diabetic on anti hypertensive therapy for 13 years developed central chest pain for 45 minutes while driving along with cold sweating and dyspnea. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?,MI,Pericarditis,Pulmonary embolism,Costochondritis,Pneumothorax,A,"The given picture of central chest pain for 45 minutes (more than 30 minutes), sweating and dyspnoea with major risk factor of DM and Htn suggest the diagnosis of MI. In pericarditis pain is aggravated by inspiration or lying flat and relieved by leaning forward. Pericardial rub may present and there may be fever. In pneumothorax pain is not central but pleuritic. Pulmonary embolism causes dyspnoea and pleuritic chest pain. In costrochondritis localized pain/tenderness at the costochondral junction enhanced by motion, coughing, or sneezing"
cardiovascular system,308,A 81 year old male with a history of hypertension and inferior MI is seen in the cardiology clinic due to worsening angina and heart failure and 2 syncopal episodes. He is found to have an ejection systolic murmur loudest at the apex and on listening to his chest he has findings in keeping with heart failure. His bloods are unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely to be causing his syncopal episodes and worsening angina and heart failure?,Aortic Stenosis,Mitral regurgitation,Atrial Fibrillation,Coronary Artery Disease,Renal Failure,A,Aortic Stenosis explains all of the symptoms of worsening angina and heart failure and the 2 episodes of syncope. Although the murmur is loudest at the apex mitral regurgitation is less likely to explain the syncopal episodes. In the elderly sometimes the Aortic Stenosis can be heard best at the apex.  This gentleman due to his symptomology requires an Echocardiograph and a Coronary Angiography.
cardiovascular system,309,A 65 year old female present with intermittent diarrhoea and abdominal pain. She has also noticed her face flushing at times. She has now become increasingly breathless and fatigued. On examination there is evidence of peripheral oedema and hepatomegaly. There is also evidence of a pansystolic murmur loudest at the LLSE. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Pulmonary stenosis,Mitral regurgitation,Aortic Regurgitation,Tricuspid regurgitation,Aortic Stenosis,D,The most likely underlying diagnosis is carcinoid syndrome which can lead to tricuspid regurgitation and this is indicated with the pansystolic murmur at the LLSE. Mitral regurgitation also leads to a pan systolic murmur but this is loudest at the apex and radiates to the axilla. Aortic stenosis leads to an ejection systolic murmur and aortic regurgitation an early diastolic murmur.
cardiovascular system,310,A 46-year-old African-Caribbean man is found to have BP 160/90mmHg on 3 separate occasions. What is the best initial treatment?,ACEi,Beta-blockers,ARBs,None,CCB,E,If age less than 55 years In general ACEI or Beta blockers are preferred. But in case of Afro-Caribbean origin CCB is chosen even in younger age as it gives better results in this ethnic group
cardiovascular system,311,A 67-year-old man with insulin-dependent diabetes with a broad complex pulseless tachyarrhythmia (with a protected airway) has just been defibrillated for the third time without return of cardiac output. CPR is immediately resumed and adrenaline administered. Which of the following is the next step in the management of the arrest?,Adrenaline 1 mg only,Amiodarone 300 mg,DC shock,Lidocaine 100 mg,Removal of oxygen and then DC shock,B,The next step is amiodarone 300 mg intravenously (i.e. given after the third shock). If amiodarone is not available lidocaine is a suitable alternative. 
cardiovascular system,312,A 74-year-old woman with longstanding hypertension and rheumatoid arthritis present with dyspnoea. On examination she is in atrial fibrillation and is normotensive. The jugular venous pressure (JVP) is elevated. She has bilateral pitting lower limb oedema and ascites. Her echocardiogram shows normal left ventricular systolic function and biatrial enlargement. Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Constrictive pericarditis,Hypertensive heart disease,Hypothyroidism,Lymphatic obstruction,Pulmonary fibrosis,A,"The combination of the following is typical of constrictive pericarditis:  Shortness of breath Atrial fibrillation Lower limb oedema Ascites Raised JVP, and Biatrial enlargement with normal systolic ventricular function.  Further ECHO examination would reveal peak systolic and diastolic values decreasing with inspiration, and impaired diastolic function. Constrictive pericarditis is the commonest cardiac complication of rheumatoid arthritis. It is found in 30-50% of patients at postmortem and up to 30% by echocardiography. It is commoner in males and seropositive patients with active joint disease. Histopathology shows chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Pericardial fluid is usually an exudate with high protein and lactate dehydrogenase and low glucose. Infective pericarditis is an important differential diagnosis, which is also more common in rheumatoid arthritis. Symptoms are present in only 24% patients and can be non-specific, which often delays the diagnosis. Fewer than 0.5% experience haemodynamic compromise. Presentations include pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, oedema and hepatic congestion. Signs are also non-specific and include pericardial rub, tachycardia, and quiet heart sounds. Echocardiography is the investigation of choice, but CT is also useful to confirm pericardial thickening. Cardiac catheterisation is used if pericardectomy is considered. Pericarditis is usually treated only if it is symptomatic. First line treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or steroids. Effusion or constriction is associated with a high mortality, and surgical treatment is associated with better long term outcome if patients can tolerate thoracotomy and pericardial resection. Hypertension is another cause of diastolic dysfunction, and chronically elevated levels leads to changes in myocardial structure and the conduction system. Left ventricular hypertrophy is typically seen on echocardiography. Hypothyroidism leads to a decrease in cardiac output and contractility, reduced heart rate and increased peripheral vascular resistance. Symptomatic cardiac disease is rare, and there is no history of thyroid disease in this patient. Lymphatic obstruction causes lymphoedema, which is most obvious in the limbs. Pulmonary fibrosis can be associated with rheumatoid arthritis, but most often occurs in middle-aged men and presents with an insidious onset of dyspnoea with occasional dry cough. In most cases it is associated with severe arthritis, with high serum levels of rheumatoid factor. Whilst associated pulmonary vasculitis may cause pulmonary hypertension, this is not present in all cases.  "
cardiovascular system,313,Which of the following is correct regarding intravenous cannulae?,Flow rate is calculated from the Bernoulli equation,Flow rate is directly proportional to the radius to the power of 2,Longer cannulae have faster flow rates,With a 14 gauge have a flow rate of approximately 500 ml per minute,With a 20 gauge have a flow rate of approximately 60 ml per minute,E,"The Hagen-Poiseuille equation is used to calculate flow through tubes and cylinders:  Where P is the pressure gradient across the tube of length l and radius r to the power of 4. π is, of course, Pi and η the viscosity of the fluid or gas. Thus wider and shorter cannulae have faster flow rates. The flow rate through intravenous cannulae varies between manufacturers, but a 14 G and 20 G cannula have approximate flow rates of 300 ml/min and 60 ml/min respectively. "
cardiovascular system,314,"A 65-year-old woman, a heavy smoker for many years, has had worsening dyspnoea for the past five years, without a significant cough. A chest x ray shows increased lung size along with flattening of the diaphragm, consistent with emphysema. Over the next several years she develops worsening peripheral oedema. Her BP is 115/70 mmHg. Which of the following cardiac findings is most likely to be present?",Constrictive pericarditis,Left ventricular aneurysm,Mitral valve stenosis,Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis,Right ventricular hypertrophy,E,This lady has chronic obstructive airways disease and subsequent cor pulmonale leading to right heart failure. Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis is a condition seen in frail ill individuals.
cardiovascular system,315,A 64-year-old man is admitted with a right femoral neck fracture following a fall. Also seen in the radiograph of the pelvis are several prominent calcified vessels. What is the most appropriate next step in management of this finding?,Anticoagulate with heparin,Ignore it,Order a pulmonary ventilation-perfusion scan,Request a serum troponin test,Start the patient on a nitrate infusion,B,"This finding is typical for Monckeberg's calcific medial sclerosis, a benign condition involving muscular arteries of older persons."
cardiovascular system,316,A 45-year-old man had recently started taking anti-hypertensive therapy. 6 months later his RBS is 14mmol/l. Which single drug is most likely to have caused this?,Amlodipine,Bendroflumethiazide,Doxazosin,Lorsartan,Ramipril,B,High blood sugar is a well known side effect of thiazide (here bendroflumethiazide)
cardiovascular system,317,Which electrocardiographic feature contributes to the diagnosis of hyperacute anterolateral myocardial infarction (MI)?,A Q wave of less than 0.04 seconds in lead AVR,Presence of a U wave in lead V3,Prolonged QT interval,Slope-elevation of the ST segment,"Tall, wide T waves",D,"The characterisitics of hyperacute anterolateral MI would be elevated ST segments in anterior and lateral leads (aVL, I, and V2-6) and/or T wave inversion. U waves are seen in hypokalaemia. Tall, wide T waves suggest VT. Prolonged QT interval is associated with congenital abnormalities, such as Lown-Ganong-Levine syndrome and hypocalcaemia, and drugs such as amiodarone."
cardiovascular system,318,Angina due to an imbalance between O^2 supply and demand without atherosclerosis would most likely be seen in which of the following circumstances?,Aortic regurgitation,Cardiac tamponade,Pulmonary regurgitation,Right heart failure,Tricuspid regurgitation,A,"Non-atherosclerotic angina would be associated with conditions such as:  thyrotoxicosis aortic regurgitation aortic stenosis hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and anaemia  The other scenarios don't lead to an oxygen deficiet."
cardiovascular system,319,"A 50 year old female presents with shortness of breath on exertion. She has completed chemotherapy for breast cancer approximately 6 months ago. On examination her apex beat is displacede and there is evidence of a 3rd heart sound and bibasal crackles. A CXR is requested and reveals cardiomegaly and bilateral small pleural effusions, interstitial oedema and upper lobe diversion. What chemotherapy may have lead to the heart failure?",Vincristine,Bleomycin,Doxorubicin,Cisplatin,Tamoxifen,C,Doxorubicin is associated with heart failure as well as tachyarrhythmias.
cardiovascular system,320,"A 72-year-old man presented following three episodes of transient loss of consciousness not associated with chest pain. There was a previous history of an anterior myocardial infarction. On examination his blood pressure was 140/80 mmHg and the apex beat was diffuse in character and displaced to the left. There were no neurological signs. The ECG showed sinus rhythm with occasional ventricular extrasystoles, deep anterior Q waves and ST segment elevation in leads V2-V6, without reciprocal depression. Which one of the following would be the most appropriate initial course of action?",Administer tissue plasminogen activator,Arrange an electroencephalogram,Arrange immediate computerised tomography (CT) brain scan,Observe in the coronary care unit,Proceed to coronary arteriography,D,"The history suggests that this man has persistent ST elevation in the anterior leads, with a previous history of anterior myocardial infarction due to left ventricular (LV) aneurysm. The blackouts are cardiac syncope due to rhythm disturbance. An ECHO would quickly support the diagnosis but, because of the risk of sudden death, observation on CCU is required. The loss of consciousness is likely to be due to recurrent arrhythmic episodes or vertebrobasilar transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), as a result of embolisation of an LV thrombus. The most important investigation for this patient whom you suspect has arrhythmic episodes would be telemetry/24 hour monitoring, and hence observation on the coronary care unit (CCU) is appropriate.

cardiovascular system,321,"A 64-year-old man has recently suffered from an MI and is on aspirin, atorvastatin and ramipril. He has been having trouble sleeping and has been losing weight for the past 4 months. He doesn’t feel like doing anything he used to enjoy and has stopped socializing. He says he gets tired easily and can’t concentrate on anything. What is the most appropriate treatment?",Lofepramine,Dosulepin,Citalopram,Fluoxetine,Phenelzine,C,Depression is common among patients recovering from a myocardial infarction. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with MI experience major depression and at least twice as many as that have significant symptoms of depression soon after the event. Post-MI depression is an independent risk factor for increased mortality (as depression is clearly associated with poor compliance with risk-reducing recommendations). For treating this depression SSRIs are recommended as first line agent and among SSRIs Sertraline is the drug of choice for ischemic heart disease. Next choice is citalopram (as it is often related to torsades de pointes it is not 1st choice). If SSRI cannot be used Mirtazapine is recommended as next antidepressant
cardiovascular system,322,"A 70-year-old man presents with acutely painful, pale paralysed and pulseless left leg. He is noted to have atrial fibrillation. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Intermittent claudication,Cardiovascular syphilis,Buerger’s disease,Chronic limb ischemia,Acute limb ischemia,E,AF may be the cause of thrombus leading to embolic acute limb ischemia
cardiovascular system,323,A 23 year old female has been referred to the cardiology clinic. She has been increasingly shortness of breath and can barely climb stair without becoming short of breath. She is found to be hypertensive. An ECHO revealed right atrial hypertrophy and raised right atrial pressure. Cardiac catheterisation was performed and revealed a higher than normal oxygen saturation in the right atrium and ventricle. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Atrial Septal Defect (Ostium primum),Ventricular septal defect,Patent ductus arteriosus,Atrial Septal Defect (Ostium secundum),Pulmonary Hypertension,D,The evidence of higher than normal saturation in the right ventricle evidences a left to right shunt as the saturation is higher in the right ventricle due to it receiving oxygenated blood from the left side of the heart. This means there is an ASD and due to the lack of cyanosis then secundum is the likely defect.
cardiovascular system,324,Which of the following  is a mechanism by which Brain Natiuretic Peptide causes it's effects in the body?,Inhibits renin release,Angiotensin receptor blocker,Stimulates renin release,Inhibits angiotensin converting enzyme,Vasoconstriction,A,Both ANP and BNP are released from the atria and ventricles respectively when they become distended. Natiuretic peptides counteract certain compensatory mechanisms in heart failure. They lead to vasodilatation and also inhibit renin release which counteracts the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to a reduction in intravascular volume and blood pressure.
cardiovascular system,325,"A 59-year-old lady is admitted with a 30 minute history of heavy central chest pain associated with nausea and sweating. Her ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1, V2, V3 and V4. Which of the following coronary arteries is most likely to be occluded?",Circumflex artery,Left anterior descending artery,Obtuse marginal artery,Posterior descending artery,Right coronary artery,B,An anteroseptal myocardial infarction (MI) is due to an infarct in the territory of the left anterior descending artery. Circumflex artery MI presents in the lateral leads. Posterior descending artery MI presents in the posterior leads. Right coronary artery MI presents in the inferior/lateral leads.

A similar episode had occurred previously whilst playing squash. There is nil of note on examination and blood results are normal however you note he has a QT interval of 0.52secs on his ECG. He is also found to have paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation on further investigation with a 24 hour tape. What is the drug of choice for rhythm control in this patient?",Flecainide,Amiodarone,Verapamil,Adenosine,Atenolol,E,For Long QT Syndrome Rhythm control is best achieved with beta blockers due to them causing a reduction in conduction through the AV node. If this fails then Thoracic Sympathectomy has been widely used in Europe as second line therapy. Implantable cardiovertor defibrillators are useful in conjunction with beta blockers for people who are symptomatic despite being on full dosage. Amiodarone an Flecainide should be avoided as these increase the risk of Torsades de pointes.
cardiovascular system,327,A 65-year-old African man with a known history of hypertension presents with ankle oedema after taking an antihypertensive prescribed by his general practitioner. He is now found to have a blood pressure of 180/100 mmHg. Which of the following would be the preferred drug for this patient?,Amlodipine,Atenolol,Bendroflumethiazide,Ramipril,Verapamil,C,"The patient has ankle oedema which is usually due to vasodilatation by calcium channel blockers. The optimal antihypertensive therapy for black Afro-Caribbean patients (if a CCB is not suitable, for example because of oedema) will be a thiazide-like diuretic according to current NICE guidance, 2011. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are preferred for those patients with heart failure or diabetic nephropathy. β-blockers are preferred for post-myocardial infarction and ischaemic heart disease.

cardiovascular system,328,"A 35-year-old woman presents with fever, rigors, malaise, and weight loss. She had undergone prosthetic valve replacement one month before. C3 level was reduced and echocardiography showed small vegetations. Which microorganism is most likely to be responsible for this?",Candida,Coxiella burnetii,Staphylococcus aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Streptococcus viridans,D,"Prosthetic valve endocarditis arising within two months of valve surgery is generally the result of intraoperative contamination of the prosthesis or a bacteraemia postoperative complication. The nosocomial nature of these infections is reflected in their primary microbial causes:  Coagulase-negative staphylococci (Staphylococcus epidermidis) S. aureus Facultative Gram negative bacilli Diphtheroids Fungi.  Whilst a recent study^1 did show that Staphylococcus aureus was the most common cause of prosthetic valve infective endocarditis it is thought that this may have been due to recruitment or referral bias. The trend has not been replicated in all subsequent studies. Therefore, for the exam, it is safer currently to state that Staphylococcus epidermidis is the commonest colonising organism within 6 months of implantation of a prosthetic valve.  The oral cavity, skin, and upper respiratory tract are the respective primary portals for the viridans Streptococci, Staphylococci, and HACEK organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Cardiobacterium, Eikenella, and Kingella), causing community-acquired native valve endocarditis. Streptococcus bovis originates from the gastrointestinal tract, where it is associated with polyps and colonic tumours, and Enterococci enter the bloodstream from the genitourinary tract. "
cardiovascular system,329,Which of the following infections is least likely to cause myocarditis?,Chagas disease,Coxsackie virus,Diphtheria ,Syphilis,Toxoplasmosis ,D,"Quaternary syphilis involves the cardiovascular system, commonly in the form of ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic regurgitation but can cause myocarditis rarely. Quaternery syphilis is also largely no longer seen and for this reason is lowest on the list of differentials for myocarditis. Diphtheria, coxsackie virus, Chagas disease, and toxoplasmosis are all associated with myocarditis."
cardiovascular system,330,"A 59-year-old male presents with a one hour history of central crushing chest pain. He is known to be diabetic, hypertensive, and is a non-smoker. On examination his pulse rate is 90 beats/min, blood pressure 130/85 mmHg, S1 S2 are audible with no murmurs. There is no evidence of cardiac failure. An electrocardiogram (ECG) is performed. In the absence of PCI facilities, which of the following would be an indication for thrombolysis?",Atrial fibirillation greater than150 min^−1,Right bundle branch block,"ST depression of 2 mm in leads II, III, avF",ST elevation of 2 mm in V4-V6,Supraventricular tachycardia,D,"This patient is having an acute myocardial infarction (MI); the ECG changes of ST elevation of 2 mm in V4-V6 suggest an anterolateral MI. Given this history and ECG changes, he should be given thrombolytic treatment, along with aspirin, heparin, beta blockade, statin therapy, and subsequent angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. ECG criteria for thrombolysis within 24 hours of typical pain include:  ST elevation of more than 1 mm in standard limb leads ST elevation more than 2 mm in anterior chest leads, and new left bundle branch block.  Evidence beyond 12 hours of pain is equivocal thrombolysis at this time; it tends to be used if there is clinical deterioration or persistent pain. According to NICE guidelines on the management of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation:  1.1.3 Deliver coronary reperfusion therapy (either primary PCI or fibrinolysis) as quickly as possible for eligible people with acute STEMI. 1.1.4 Offer coronary angiography, with follow-on primary PCI if indicated, as the preferred coronary reperfusion strategy for people with acute STEMI if:  presentation is within 12 hours of onset of symptoms and primary PCI can be delivered within 120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given.  1.1.5 Offer fibrinolysis to people with acute STEMI presenting within 12 hours of onset of symptoms if primary PCI cannot be delivered within 120 minutes of the time when fibrinolysis could have been given. 1.1.6 When treating people with fibrinolysis, give an antithrombin at the same time.

cardiovascular system,331,Which one of the following cardiac enzymes would be expected to begin to increase between 6-10 hours after a myocardial infarction?,Aspartate transaminase (AST),Creatine kinase (CK),LDH,Troponin I,Troponin T,A,"Cardiac troponins are the most widely used test following a myocardial infarct in the UK. Both troponin I and T are highly sensitive and specific for cardiac damage, and are of equal clinical value. Serum levels begin to increase within 3-12 hours from the onset of pain, peak at 24-48 hours and return to baseline over 5-14 days. CK-MB levels also increase within 3-12 hours of onset of chest pain and peak within 24 hours, but return to baseline quicker than troponin (after 48-72 hours). Sensitivity and specificity are not as high as for troponin levels. The most sensitive early marker for myocardial infarction is myoglobin (troponin may not rise until 6 hours following myocyte injury). Myoglobin can be detected within 2 hours of cardiac myocyte damage, but is not specific as it is also present in skeletal muscle. LDH is also less specific than troponin, although the LDH-1 isoenzyme is predominantly found in cardiac muscle so a high LDH-1:LDH-2 ratio can indicate myocardial damage. Levels begin to rise 24-48 hours, peak at 72 hours, and remain elevated for 10 days. It is not widely used in UK practice. AST is very non-specific, and is no longer widely used in the UK. Levels become elevated at 6-10 hours, peak at 24-36 hours and remain high for 3-5 days. "
cardiovascular system,332,"A 27 year old man who uses cocaine on a regular basis and who is a smoker presents with central crushing chest pain of 3 hours duration. He had been using cocaine prior to the onset of the chest pain. He is found to be hypertensive and tachycardic. An ECG revealed ST elevation of 3mm in I, II, aVL and V4 V6. What is the next step in the management?",Primary PCI,Repeat ECG,"Aspirin, Clopidogrel and LMWH",Request Troponin,Thrombolysis,A,"The evidence base shows that patients with acute STEMI should be referred for primary PCI as it is superior to thrombolysis. PCI should be considered first line management and if patients can reach a primary PCI centre within 90 minutes. Protocols vary in regions however often aspirin, clopidogrel and a bolus of heparin is given before PCI. This should not change in those with cocaine although beta blockers should be avoided as this can worsen the vasospasm."
cardiovascular system,333,What auscultatory findings would you expect to find with a left bundle branch block?,Fixed splitting of the 2nd heart sound,Reversed splitting of the 2nd heart sound and loud first heart sound,Normal 2nd heart sound and soft first Heart sound,Normal first and second heart sounds,Reversed splitting of the 2nd heart sound,E,In LBBB there is a delay in the closure of the the aortic valve leading to reversed splitting. Th first heart sound is also softer.
cardiovascular system,334,A 24-year-old man is admitted from a football match by ambulance. He collapsed during the game. Medical staff who attended the scene found him to be in VT and he was shocked by the automated defibrillator which was at the stadium. By the time he reaches the Emergency Department he is beginning to regain consciousness and is complaining of a sore chest from where he was shocked. On examination his blood pressure is elevated at 145/82 mmHg. He has a double apical impulse and a mid systolic murmur. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 134 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 5.6 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 201 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 105 μmol/L (60-120)   ECG LVH with anterior Q waves    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Brugada syndrome,HOCM,Long QT,Post viral cardiomyopathy,Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome,B,"The double apical impulse, mid systolic murmur and ECG appearance is typical of that seen with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). It is the commonest cause of genetic cardiac disease, affecting 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 adults. Patients present with symptoms of dyspnoea, angina and syncope due to outflow obstruction, although sudden cardiac death is usually related to fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Implantable defibrillators are now the treatment of choice in patients who suffer ventricular arrhythmias. Patients with Brugada syndrome present with ventricular arrhythmias, but have structurally normal hearts."
cardiovascular system,335,"A 60-year-old man presented with a rash over his forearms, shins and face when he visited the cardiology clinic in the summer. Which of the following medications is the most likely to be associated with this photosensitive rash?",Atenolol,Bendroflumethiazide,Clopidogrel,Digoxin,Ezetimibe,B,Photosensitivity is a common adverse effect and the cardiology drugs affected include amiodarone and thiazide diuretics. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (A2RBs) commonly cause rashes some of which appear to be photosensitive.
cardiovascular system,336,A 56-year-old man who is hypertensive recently underwent a change in medicines. 2 days later he developed wheezing.

cardiovascular system,337,"A 42 year old male is found to be hypertensive with a blood pressure of 190/100 mmHg. He is otherwise fit and well and there is nil of note on examination. Bloods reveal normal renal function however there is evidence of hypokalaemia, elevated bicarbonate and both renin and aldosterone levels are increased. A 24 hour urinary cortisol fell within the normal range. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cushing's syndrome,Phaeochromocytoma,Renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia,Conn's syndrome,Glomerulonephritis,C,This patient most likely is suffering from renal artery stenosis. The underlying pathology is fibromuscular dysplasia of the renal artery. It leads to hypoperfusion and thus leads to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system leading to elevated renin and aldosterone levels and thus hypokalaemia. Conn's syndrome would lead to elevated aldosterone levels and suppressed renin levels. There is a normal cortisol and nil of note on examination thus Cushing's syndrome is unlikely. There is no symptoms to suggest phaeochromocytoma.
cardiovascular system,338,"A white English man with a past history of MI is a known hypertensive and diabetic. He is currently on aspirin, statin and metformin. What would you add to the treatment?",ACEi,Diuretic,Insulin,Beta blocker,CCB,A,The patient is diabetic and has pass history of MI. In both of these situations ACEI is the antihypertensive of choice
cardiovascular system,339,Concerning the electrocardiogram (ECG) of an adult human:,A P-R interval of 0.15 seconds indicates impaired conduction,"During the isoelectric phase between the S and T waves, the intracellular potential in ventricular muscle cells is negative with respect to the interstitial fluid",Normal QT interval is 0.5 s,The Q wave coincides with depolarisation of the atria,The R wave coincides with depolarisation of the apex of the heart,E,"Atrial repolarisation is masked by ventricular depolarisation in the ECG. The correct option represents the plateau of the action potential and occurs when the intracellular potential in ventricular muscle cells is positive with respect to the interstitial fluid. Normal PR interval is 0.12-0.2 s, QRS duration less than 0.12 s and QT interval less than 0.42 s."
cardiovascular system,340,A 59-year-old man is admitted with chest pain of eight hours duration and has ST elevation in the inferior leads on his admission ECG. An electrocardiogram from a previous clinic visit shows sinus rhythm two months ago. He has insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and chronic renal failure. Investigations reveal:    Fasting plasma glucose 7.4 mmol/L (3.0-6.0)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (137-144)   Potassium 4.4 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Urea 10 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Creatinine 200 µmol/L (60-110)    Which of the following which represent an absolute contraindication to the use of thrombolysis?,Allergy to penicillin,Gastrointestinal bleeding in last three months,History of haemorrhagic stroke,Ischaemic stroke 12 months ago,On warfarin therapy,C,"Absolute contraindications to thrombolysis include:  Previous haemorrhagic stroke Ischaemic stroke in last six months Central nervous system damage or neoplasm Within three weeks of major surgery, head injury or major trauma Active internal bleeding (menses excluded) or gastrointestinal bleeding within the past month Known or suspected aortic dissection Known bleeding disorder Proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  Allergy and oral anticoagulants are relative contraindications."
cardiovascular system,341,A 72-year-old man noted to have a systolic murmur undergoes an echocardiogram which demonstrates aortic stenosis. Which of the following is associated with a poor prognosis in this patient?,Aortic regurgitation,Cardiomegaly on chest x ray,Clinical features of left ventricular failure,ECG evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy,Severe valvular calcification on echocardiogram,C,"Aortic stenosis is associated with a worse prognosis when accompanied by left ventricular (LV) dysfunction. Other predictors of a poorer prognosis include:  Increasing gradient across the valve (above 70 mmHg) Age of patient, and Symptomatology.  Although the severity of valvular calcification is prognostically important in an asymptomatic patient, the most important predictor is LV function."
cardiovascular system,342,"A 75-year-old lady presents with sudden breathlessness and palpitations. On examination, she was observed to have an irregular heart beat with rate of 140 bpm, BP 85/40 mmHg and normal heart sounds. On auscultation of the chest, fine basal crepitations are heard. An ECG confirms atrial fibrillation (AF) and an old inferior myocardial infarction. She is anticoagulated with heparin and given diuretics. Her heart rate remains rapid. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of the lady's AF?",DCCV,IV amiodarone,IV beta blocker,IV digoxin,Oral quinidine therapy,A,"The key to this question is that the patient has clinical signs of pulmonary oedema with fast AF and hypotension. In this age group AF is poorly tolerated and often leads to pulmonary oedema even in the presence of a relatively normal left ventricle (LV). NICE have published guidance on the management of Atrial fibrillation (CG180). The primary aim here should be rate control which is best achieved with direct current cardioversion (DCCV) in this situation. Digoxin, even when used intravenously, is suggested to have too slow an onset of action to merit its use. Beta blockers can also be used but due to the fact that they are negatively inotropic may complicate the acute pulmonary oedema. Emergency DCCV is required as there is haemodynamic compromise (low BP). "
cardiovascular system,343,A 20 year old has been admitted with chest pain.  He admitted to using cocaine and is found to have a STEMI.  What do you do next?,Aspirin and clopidogrel and LMWH,Percutaneous coronary intervention,Thrombolysis,IV heparin,Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors,B,"Despite the cocaine use this patient should be referred for PCI.  Cocaine thought to lead to MI due to vasospasm, increased Oxygen demand due to its sympathomimetic stimulation and direct toxicity."
cardiovascular system,344,A 40-year-old man has a hygienist appointment with his dentist for scaling. He is known to have a congenital bicuspid aortic valve. Which of the following is the most appropriate form of prophylaxis against endocarditis?,Amoxicillin 1 g IV + gentamicin 120 mg IV pre-procedure,Amoxicillin 3 g PO pre-procedure,Gentamicin 120 mg IM pre-procedure,Metronidazole 1 g PO pre-procedure,No antibiotics required,E,"Although often asymptomatic and affecting 1-2% of the population, biscupid aortic valve is a risk factor for endocarditis and later development of aortic valve disease. However, latest NICE guidance on Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (CG64) suggests that no prophylaxis is required. The guideline differs from other advice given by the British Society for Antimicrobial Therapy and the American Heart Association. It may be prudent still to offer prophylaxis to those at high risk (for example, ventricular septal defect [VSD], or previous infective endocarditis)."
cardiovascular system,345,"An 83-year-old lady with known end stage renal failure on haemodialysis three time a week missed her last haemodialysis session because she suffered a fall. The biochemistry result of her current blood test shows a serum potassium of 7.3 mmol/L. An ECG reveals small P waves, peaked T waves, and prolongation of the QRS complex. Which is the first step in the management of this condition?",10 mg salbutamol nebuliser,10 ml of 10% calcium gluconate intravenously,10 units of actrapid insulin intravenously with 100 ml of 20% dextrose,500 ml of 1.26% sodium bicarbonate intravenously,Haemodialysis,B,"Patients with renal failure are at risk of developing hyperkalaemia and the fact that this patient has missed her haemodialysis slot is the explanation in this case. The described ECG changes are typical of severe hyperkalaemia and suggest that the patient is at risk of developing an arrhythmia, usually ventricular fibrillation or asystole. The immediate management is calcium gluconate which acts to stabilise the myocardial membrane. Salbutamol, insulin, and haemodialysis would all lower the serum potassium, but stabilisation of the cardiac membrane is most important initially. Insulin, in the form of actrapid given with intravenous glucose, is normally the next step to reduce the serum potassium. Bicarbonate only helps increase excretion of potassium by the kidney if the patient is still passing urine, which may not necessarily be true in this case. Dialysis should then be given as soon as possible to maintain lower potassium levels, and correct other electrolyte abnormalities. "
cardiovascular system,346,"Which of the following is the most likely to lead to a fixed, wide split second heart sound?",Aortic stenosis,Ventricular Septal Defect,Aortic Regurgitation,Atrial Septal defect,Mitral stenosis,D,Wide fixed splitting of second heart sound is characteristic of ASD.
cardiovascular system,347,"What type of myocardial infarct has occurred if there is ST elevation in leads II, III and aVF?",Inferior NSTEMI,Inferior STEMI,Posterior Infarct,Anterolateral STEMI,Lateral STEMI,B,"Inferior STEMIs affect leads II, III and aVF, anterolateral affect I, aVL, V4 to V6 and posterior infarcts tend to show reciprocal changes in V1 to V3. Lateral infarcts affect I, II and aVL."
cardiovascular system,348,"A patient has taken an amitriptyline overdose. She is tachycardic and hypotensive and is having short runs of non sustained ventricular tachcardia. Her blood gases reveal a metabolic acidosis. In terms of the non sustained Ventricular tachycardia, what is the most appropriate management?",Implantable Defibrillator,IV Amiodarone 900mg,IV Magnesium,IV Sodium bicarbonate,IV Adenosine 6mg,D,In amitriptyline overdose Sodium bicarbonate is the treatment of choice. It has been shown to stabilise arrhythmias and increase blood pressure. Magnesium is useful in the management of VT not secondary to TCA overdose however is not the treatment of choice here. Adenosine is utilised for SVT.
cardiovascular system,349,An 19 year old who has been generally unwell with a sore throat presents with chest pain worse on inspiration and relieved on sitting forwards.  An ECG shows saddle ST elevation and PR depression in numerous leads and there is a rub on auscultation.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cardiac Tamponade,Myocarditis,EBV,STEMI,Pericarditis,E,The history and clinical and ECG findings are indicative of a pericarditis were the pain is classically relieved by sitting forwards.  It can lead to a pericardial friction rub.  Although a tamponade can develop due to this this patient is too well and there is no evidence of distended neck veins.  The pericarditis is most likely to have followed a viral illness.  It classically leads to saddle shaped ST elevation as seen in this case.  NSAIDs are utilised in the treatment.
cardiovascular system,350,"A 16-year-old male is brought to emergency admissions with alcohol intoxication. An initial ECG reveals atrial fibrillation (AF) but a repeat ECG after 12 hours when he has sobered up, shows sinus rhythm. An echocariogram is normal. What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",Aspirin for 3 months,Bisoprolol for 3 months,Lifestyle advice,Sotalol for one month,Warfarin for one month,C,"Excessive alcohol is a recognised cause for atrial fibrillation and is the likely cause here as the rhythm has reverted to sinus after 12 hours. There is also no evidence of structural heart disease as the electrocardiogram was normal. Therefore this patient needs advice regarding moderation of alcohol consumption and needs to be warned of the toxic effects that alcohol can have on the heart and other organs. There is no indication for short term aspirin. Atenolol provides rate control, which is not an issue. Sotalol/amiodarone and flecainide can be used in paroxysmal AF. Short term warfarin is used for four to six weeks prior to elective cardioversion to protect against embolic complications."
cardiovascular system,351,A 50-year-old man is being treated for hypertension and has been told by his dentist that he has gingival hyperplasia. Which of the following medications is the most likely to be the cause?,Atorvastatin,Carvedilol,Doxazosin,Nifedipine,Telmisartan,D,Three drugs to remember that are associated with gingival hyperplasia are  Phenytoin Ciclosporin Nifedipine.  
cardiovascular system,352,Which of the following findings is suggestive of another valvular lesion in a patient with mitral stenosis and no evidence of atrial fibrillation?,Right ventricular hypertrophy,Large V wave,Loud first heart sound,Large a wave,Haemoptysis,B,All are features of mitral stenosis except a large V wave which is a feature of tricuspid regurgitation.
cardiovascular system,353,A 37-year-old female with type 2 diabetes and obesity requests help with regard to weight loss. She has tried to lose weight with dietary manoeuvres but has succeeded in losing only 3 kg over the last year. She is currently receiving no treatment. On examination her BMI is 33.5 kg/m^2 and her blood pressure is 142/84 mmHg. Her most recent HbA1c is 52 mmol/mol (20-46). She asks whether there are any pharmacological therapies that may be appropriate for assisting with weight reduction. Which of the following agents is appropriate for assisting with weight loss given adequate glycaemic control in this patient?,Dexfenfluramine,Metformin,Orlistat,Phentermine,Insulin detemir,C,"This patient has demonstrated a 3 kg weight loss over the past year but, like many, has become rather stuck. The NICE guidelines on criteria for Orlistat previously stated it should be used in patients who have demonstrated dietary compliance with at least a 2.5 kg weight reduction prior to initiating orlistat. This is not now a requirement. Continued weight reduction is required if the patient is to remain on the drug (5% body weight at 12 weeks). Orlistat functions through inhibiting the absorption of dietary fat from the GI tract. Consequently, its side effects include flatulence and diarrhoea. Dexfenfluramine is associated with systemic hypertension and strokes and is now withdrawn as an anti-obesity agent, as is phentermine (valvular fibrosis) in the successful but dangerous combination Phen-Fen. Metformin is not an agent that would create weight loss, but merely improves insulin sensitivity and maintains weight (or gain weight as in sulphonylurea therapy). Similarly this patient's HbA1c is well controlled on diet alone. Insulin detemir has been associated with less weight gain or even slight weight loss compared with other insulins. However, her HbA1c is at target (less than53 mmol/mol) and therefore she does not require additional anti-glycaemic therapy at this time."
cardiovascular system,354,A 54-year-old male redevelops chest pain 72 hours after treatment for an anterior myocardial infarction. Which of the following markers will be the most appropriate to detect reinfarction?,CK-MB,LDH,Myoglobin,Troponin I,Troponin T,A,"Although troponin is highly sensitive and specific it remains elevated for at least one week after infarction. Similarly lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) will be present for approximately one week after infarction. After myocardial infarction (MI), CK-MB levels become elevated within 3 to 8 hours, peak within 9 to 30 hours, and return to normal after 48 to 72 hours. Although myoglobin has a short half life, similar sensitivity to CK-MB rises quickly after an MI and is cleared after an MI, it is not specific enough for diagnostic use."
cardiovascular system,355,Which of the following is a treatment of hyperkalaemia?,Amiloride,Atenolol,Magnesium,Phosphate,Sodium bicarbonate,E,"When electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities are present, treatment of hyperkalaemia is an emergency. The treatment includes:  Calcium chloride Sodium bicarbonate Dextrose/insulin Beta agonists Loop diuretics Drugs to bind potassium in the gastro-intestinal tract, and Dialysis.  The underlying condition must also be sought and treated. Amiloride, atenolol, magnesium and phosphate have no role in the management of hyperkalaemia. "
cardiovascular system,356,A 65 year old gentleman attends the pre operative clinic. He is awaiting a knee replacement as he has severe osteoarthritis of his knee and hip. He has had a previous myocardial infarction and over the last few months has complained of what sounds like angina pain. Which of the following is useful initially in determining if there is evidence of myocardial ischaemia?,Echocardiogram,Coronary angiography,Exercise Tolerance Test,ECG,Myocardial perfusion scan,E,An exercise tolerance test is normally utilised to assess if there is any evidence of myocardial ischaemia. However in those who are unable to exercise a myocardial perfusion scan can be utilised as an alternative as in this man's case. This is is a non invasive test and if there is any evidence of ischaemia then obviously a coronary angiography would be required before surgery could proceed. An Echo is not useful in showing evidence of ischaemia.
cardiovascular system,357,"A 68 year old female has recently had an aortic valve replacement.  She presents feeling generally unwell, feverish with night sweats and weight loss.  On examination she is pyrexial and there is a murmur in the aortic area and inflammatory markers are raised.  An echo suggests vegetations.  What antibiotics should be started empirically?",Vancomycin and Gentamicin,Rifampicin and gentamicin,Flucloxacillin,Penicillin and gentamicin,"Vancomycin, rifampicin and gentamicin",E,"Local guidelines may vary however for a prosthetic valve vancomycin, rifampicin and gentamicin is a reasonable choice initially as it is most likely a staphylococcus infection (aureus or epidermidis).  Rifampicin will cover for an MRSA.  For native endocarditis where strep viridans is the most likely agent then vancomycin/penicillin plus gentamicin is appropriate."
cardiovascular system,358,"A 60-year-old female presents with a four week history of low grade fever, dyspnoea, and fatigue. Two months ago she received a prosthetic valve replacement for mitral regurgitation. On examination she has a temperature of 37.7°C. At transoesophageal echocardiography vegetations are seen. A clinical diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis is made. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",Actinomycosis,Candida albicans,Enterococci,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Streptococcus viridans,D,"Generally there are two identifiable modes of prosthetic valve endocarcitis. The first occurs within the first year after surgery affecting 0.7-3% of cases and is often due to Staphylococci. Late endocarditis observed after two years post surgery is found in 0.5 - 1% of cases and is typically due to Streptococci - typically alpha haemolytic otherwise known as Strep. viridans.

cardiovascular system,359,Which of the following substances keeps the ductus arteriosus patent during pregnancy?,Progesterone,Dopamine,Oestrogen,Prostaglandin E2,Prostaglandin F2 alpha,D,"The ductus arteriosus is a connection between pulmonary artery and the descending aorta.It is kept open throughout the pregnancy as a result of local dilatation from prostaglandin E2 and also through prostacyclin.During ventilation of the lungs at birth the rising partial pressure of the oxygen causes the ductus arteriosus to close.Prostaglandin F2 alpha has an antagonistic effect on progesterone, and causes uterine contractions and also bronchoconstriction, but has no effect on the ductus arteriosus."
cardiovascular system,360,A 75-year-old man with atrial fibrillation is successfully cardioverted having had six weeks of anticoagulation. Which one of the following drugs would be most likely to maintain sinus rhythm following this procedure?,Amiodarone,Digoxin,Nebivolol,Sotalol,Verapamil,A,"Amiodarone is a class 3 anti-arrhythmic and has the best membrane stabilising properties of the above drugs, and is most likely to maintain sinus rhythm (SR). Sotalol is another class 3 anti-arrhythmic with an ability to maintain SR but is less effective than amiodarone. Digoxin is a class 5 anti-arrhythmic which prevents early after depolarizations. Nebivolol is a beta blocker. Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and class 4 anti-arrhythmic which increase AV node polarization."
cardiovascular system,361,Which of the following is currently recommended as the drug of choice in treating refractory ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular tachycardia?,Adenosine,Amiodarone,Bretylium,Lidocaine,Magnesium,B,"300 mg of amiodarone made up to 20 ml with 5% dextrose given as an intravenous bolus is the drug of choice. 100 mg of lidocaine may be given intravenously when amiodarone is unavailable. Historically 5 mg/Kg of bretylium was given, but it is no longer recommended. Adenosine is used in SVT to ascertain the underlying rhythm. Magnesium is used in arrythmias associated with low magnesium levels i.e QTC abnormalities."
cardiovascular system,362,A 60-year-old man who has been prescribed lisinopril for hypertension presents with an irritating cough. What is the mechanism responsible for ACE-induced cough?,Angiotensin I accumulation ,Asthma,Bradykinin accumulation ,Laryngeal irritation,Renin accumulation,C,The enzyme ACE is also responsible for the metabolism of bradykinin in mast cells. The accumulation of this substance is responsible for the cough found in up to 30% of subjects taking ACE-inhibitors. This phenomenon is not seen in subjects taking angiotensin receptor blockers such as losartan.
cardiovascular system,363,"A 50-year-old politician presented with a strange fluttering sensation in his chest, but no chest pain. The symptoms had lasted 24 hours. An ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a ventricular rate of 130 beats per minute. Which one of the following drugs is most likely to restore sinus rhythm?",Adenosine,Bisoprolol,Digoxin,Flecainide,Verapamil,D,"Flecainide is the drug most likely to restore sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation. Care is required in patients who may have left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, although this is unlikely in a previously fit, relatively young patient. Adenosine is used to cardiovert supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). Digoxin and bisoprolol are indicated for rate control and are not normally associated with the restoration of sinus rhythm. Verapamil can be used for rate control in atrial fibrillation, and may be used in the treatment of SVT."
cardiovascular system,364,"An 80-year-old male presented with palpitations of five hours duration. One month previously he suffered weakness of the right arm and problems with his speech which resolved within four hours. He was taking no medication. On examination, he was stable with a pulse of 135 beats per minute which was confirmed to be atrial fibrillation on ECG. He had a blood pressure of 112/80 mmHg and appeared clinically euthyroid. Within one hour he reverted to sinus rhythm spontaneously. Echocardiogram was normal but a 24 hour ECG revealed three episodes of atrial fibrillation each lasting around ten minutes. Which one of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient?",Amiodarone,Aspirin,Atenolol,Digoxin,Warfarin,E,The most appropriate initial therapy for this patient who has a high risk of thrombo-embolic stroke is anticoagulation with warfarin maintaining an international normalised ratio (INR) between 2-3. This should be the initial priority as he has already had one episode of transient ischaemic attack (TIA). The maintenance of sinus rhythm would be the next step and amiodarone or sotalol are options.
cardiovascular system,365,A patient presents with irregularly irregular pulse of 162bpm. What drug is most useful initially?,Amiodarone,Digoxin,Bisoprolol,Warfarin,Heparin,C,"Most likely its acute AF and 1st line is verapamil/bisoprolol, 2nd line digoxin/amiodarone"
cardiovascular system,366,"A 52-year-old lady presents with a history of crushing central chest pain, sweating, and dyspnoea. An ECG confirms acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation in leads V2-V4 and ST depression in leads II and III. Which of the following would be a contraindication to thrombolysis in this lady?",History of peptic ulcer disease,Intracranial neoplasm,Ischaemic stroke two years previously,Menstruation,Pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy,B,"Contraindications to thrombolysis include:  Intracranial neoplasm (as here) Ischaemic stroke within six months Pregnancy Active internal bleeding Aortic dissection Recent significant head injury, and Severe and uncontrolled hypertension."
cardiovascular system,367,"A man with prosthetic heart valve underwent hemicolectomy and after some days complains of left hypochondriac pain, fever and has a systolic murmur. What is the next investigation to ascertain the cause of HF?",CT,Blood culture,ECG,MRI,Radioactive thyroid scan,B,"The diagnosis is infective endocarditis. Fever + new murmur suggest endocarditis until proven otherwise.Important risk factors: dermatitis, IV injections, renal failure, organ transplantation, DM, post operative wound. Risk of developing endocarditis in following abnormalities of valves: aortic or mitral valve disease, tricuspid valve in IV drug users, prosthetic valves"
cardiovascular system,368,Which of the following is true in a patient with a suspected pulmonary embolus (PE)?,A positive ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan shows absent ventilation in a region with persistent perfusion,An increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and hypercarbia occurs following a PE,"Electrocardiogram (ECG) changes include an S1, Q3, T3 pattern and signs of left ventricular strain",Pulmonary embolectomy is contraindicated with a peripheral PE,The presence of a pleural rub can distinguish a PE from pneumonia,D,"A pulmonary embolus (PE) can present with:  Dyspnoea Pleuritic chest pain (with an audible pleural rub) Haemoptysis Cyanosis Pulmonary hypertension Right ventricular failure, and Cardiac arrest.  PEs can also be asymptomatic. A pleural rub may also be found on auscultation in pneumonia, so it cannot be used to confirm a PE. A positive V/Q scan will show persistent ventilation in a region with absent perfusion (not ventilation). The presence of co-existing pulmonary pathology reduces the sensitivity of this investigation. The associated ECG changes in a PE are not diagnostic, but include signs of right (not left) ventricular strain with right axis deviation, right bundle branch block and the S1, Q3, T3 pattern (S wave in lead I, Q wave and inverted T wave in lead III). The classical findings on arterial blood gas analysis show:  Hypoxia Hypocarbia (not hypercarbia), and An increased alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient.  Treatment of a PE requires systemic anticoagulation (heparin followed by warfarin), and in selected cases only (central PE) surgical embolectomy may be performed."
cardiovascular system,369,A 30-year-old Caucasian man with HIV infection was found to have high blood pressure at 180/118 mmHg (high on several occasions). His father died of stroke at the age of 51. Routine blood tests showed:    Sodium 145 mmol/L (135-145)   Potassium 3.4 mmol/L (3.5-5.1)   Creatinine 99 µmol/L (60-110)   Urea 4.9 mmol/L (2.9-9.0)   Urinanalysis No proteinuria   Plasma aldosterone 815 pmol/L (28-445)   Plasma renin 0.3 ng/ml/h (0.7-5)   Renal ultrasound Normal-sized kidneys   CD4 769 cells/ml   HIV RNA 4531 copies/ml    He was not on any antiretroviral therapy. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his high arterial blood pressure?,Adult polycystic kidney,Conn's syndrome,Familial essential hypertension,HIV associated nephropathy,Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma involving kidneys,B,"High aldosterone and low renin levels indicate primary hyperaldosteronism which accounts for up to 10% of all hypertensive patients. It is the most prevalent form of secondary hypertension. Potassium level is often normal or the lower limit of normal; as such, hypokalaemia is not a prerequisite for the diagnosis of Conn's syndrome. Normal renal ultrasound makes adult polycystic kidney an unlikely cause of high blood pressure. High aldosterone and low renin level is not seen in familial essential hypertension. HIV-associated nephropathy causes proteinuria. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is often associated with low CD4 count. "
cardiovascular system,370,"A 76-year-old man was admitted to the medical assessment unit with bleeding per rectum. He was pain-free and haemodynamically stable. His past medical history included myocardial infarction two years ago, atrial fibrillation and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. His medication included digoxin 125 µgrams per day, furosemide 40 mg per day, warfarin 3 mg per day and salbutamol inhaler. His haemoglobin was 96 g/L on admission. However, ten hours later he suddenly became hypotensive and was resuscitated with two units of Gelofusine and two units of blood. An emergency GI endoscopy was inconclusive. An angiogram confirmed the diagnosis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Angiodysplasia,Colonic tumour,Diverticular disease of the large bowel,"Granulomatous ulceration, that is, Crohn's disease",Ischaemic colitis,A,"Angiodysplasia is a common degenerative condition of vessels, which is associated with age. Vessels become ectatic and thin, with little or no smooth muscle, and they are therefore prone to bleeding. It may present as an isolated lesion, or be associated with multiple lesions throughout the GI tract (and therefore present as either upper or lower GI bleeding). The lesions are often difficult to locate, so endoscopy can be reported as normal.  The following can be more easily identified at endoscopy:  Colonic tumour Diverticular disease of the large bowel, and Granulomatous ulceration pathology.  Ischaemic colitis can present with massive bleeding, but abdominal pain is a predominant feature. "
cardiovascular system,371,Which of the following is true of a venous air embolism (VAE) in an adult?,Capnography provides a late means of detection,Cardiovascular collapse can occur with a volume of 10 ml,Electrocardiograph (ECG) changes are common,Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) is increased,The 'mill-wheel murmur' is an early sign,D,"Air can enter the circulation through open veins and sinuses at the site of surgery (above the level of the heart) and via venous catheters. The classic 'mill-wheel murmur' is a late and insensitive sign (not early), and usually requires a volume of 1.5-4 ml/kg. However, cardiovascular collapse may precede this sign, and has been reported with less than1 ml/kg of air (not 10 ml). Pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) increases following air embolism, because of the obstructed pulmonary vascular bed. It returns to pre-embolic levels as the embolus is absorbed and cleared. Capnography provides an early indication (not late) of air embolism by a fall in the end-tidal CO2. This is due to an increase in dead space caused by the bubbles in the pulmonary bed. The ECG changes usually only occur with significant air embolisms, and can range from signs of right ventricular strain and tachycardia to life threatening arrhythmias."
cardiovascular system,372,"A 55-year-old female who has a long history of alcohol abuse presents with back pain and mild diarrhoea, one month after having a pacemaker inserted. On examination, she had a fever of 39°C and her abdomen was soft and non-tender. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Diverticulitis ,Ischaemic colitis ,Pancreatitis ,Pseudomembranous colitis, Staphylococcal discitis ,E,"All patients with alcohol dependence have an increased risk of pancreatitis, but this is less likely without any abdominal signs. Ischaemic colitis classically presents with bloody diarrhoea. The prophylactic antibiotics given four weeks previously for her pacemaker insertion would not really have predisposed her to pseudomembranous colitis. Staphylococci are skin organisms most commonly introduced during pacemaker insertion and such a discitis would present with back pain."
cardiovascular system,373,"A 60-year-old woman with ischaemic heart disease is seen for review. She reports that she has developed symmetrical muscle aches and pains and you attribute this to a myalgia associated with simvastatin. Her creatinine kinase is within the normal range. However, her dyslipidaemia management is still suboptimal and you wish to add in a further agent.    Total cholesterol 5.5 mmol/l (less than5.2)   LDL cholesterol 3.8 mmol/l (less than3.36)   HDL cholesterol 1.3 mmol/l (greater than1.55)   Triglycerides 1.4 mmol/l (0.45-1.69)    You plan to continue the statin treatment. Which of the following agents would be the most appropriate additional therapy for this patient?",Cholestyramine,Ezetimibe,Gemfibrozil,Nicotinic acid,Omega-3 fatty acids,B,"This patient presents with a probable statin-induced myalgia which often improves with time. Sometimes stopping therapy briefly or reintroducing a different statin may resolve the myalgia. Statin-induced myositis is relatively uncommon occurring in approximately 0.1-0.2%. The risk of myositis and the potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis is, in prone subjects, increased with gemfibrozil in combination with a statin and as such should be avoided. Additional agents could include omega-3 fatty acids and ezetimibe. Nicotinic acid is less used due to problems with flushing though can be useful particularly in hypertriglyceridaemia. Cholestyramine can also be used. In this case it is the low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol that needs to be targeted and ezetimibe would be the most appropriate choice."
cardiovascular system,374,Which of the following is true regarding deep venous thrombosis (DVT)?,Patients with antithrombin III deficiency are at increased risk of DVT,Patients with connective tissue disease are at decreased risk of DVT,The incidence of DVT is reduced by thoracic epidural anaesthesia,The incidence of DVT is reduced in protein C deficiency,The incidence of DVT is reduced in protein S deficiency,A,"Patients with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) usually present with physical signs that are unreliable or non-specific, and frequently require investigation to confirm the diagnosis. Some calf vein thromboses can be asymptomatic. Risk factors associated with thromboembolic disease (DVT and pulmonary embolism) include hypercoagulable states, such as deficiencies of:  Protein C Protein S Antithrombin III, and Plasminogen.  Other risk factors include:  Malignancy Prolonged immobility The oral contraceptive pill Pregnancy Obesity Previous DVT Varicose veins Polycythaemia Myocardial infarction Cardiac failure, and Connective tissue diseases.  Lumbar (not thoracic) epidurals and spinals have been associated with a reduced incidence of DVT. This has been attributed to the increased blood flow to the lower limbs, reduced venous stasis and reduced blood viscosity (from intravenous fluid loading)."
cardiovascular system,375,"A 63-year-old male is admitted with a 30 minute history of central chest pain associated with nausea and sweating. His ECG reveals ST elevation in leads II, III, and aVF. Which of the following coronary arteries is most likely to be occluded?",Circumflex artery,Left anterior descending artery,Obtuse marginal artery,Posterolateral artery,Right coronary artery,E,The patient has had an inferior myocardial infarction (MI) and this is most likely due to occlusion of the right coronary artery. Left anterior descending artery (LAD) occlusion results in anterior infarction; circumflex or lateral branch of the LAD results in lateral infarction. Right coronary artery (RCA) occlusion may also cause posterior infarction. 
cardiovascular system,376,A 66-year-old man has developed chronic renal failure with a serum urea of 60 mmol/L (2.5-7.5) and creatinine of 650 mol/L (60-110). Auscultation of the chest reveals a friction rub over the cardiac apex. There are no other clinical signs of note and no bleeding. Which of the following types of pericarditis is he likely to have?,Constrictive,Fibrinous,Haemorrhagic,Purulent,Serous,B,The uraemia leads to exudation of fibrin onto the epicardial and pericardial surfaces. Haemorrhagic pericarditis is more typical of tuberculosis or metastatic tumour. Serous pericarditis is more typical of collagen vascular diseases. In most cases of acute pericarditis neutophil infiltration and inflammatory exudate casuses a fibrinous reaciton. There have been some cases reporting haemorrhagic causes due to platelet dysfunction secondary touraemia. 
cardiovascular system,377,A 68-year-old lady presents to her GP for an annual review of her heart failure treatment. She has a blood pressure of 165/90 mmHg. She is currently taking furosemide and aspirin and she experiences dyspnoea on walking up hills. Which of the following is the most appropriate medication to add?,Bendroflumethiazide,Enalapril,Isosorbide mononitrate,Spironolactone,Titrate dose of furosemide,B,"ACE inhibitors and beta blockers are first line treatments in heart failure. ACE inhibitors remain one of the cornerstones of the treatment of heart failure (SOLVD and CONSENSUS trials).  There is clear evidence that higher doses exert greater benefit. They are usually very well tolerated, especially in milder cases. An ARB can be used if ACEi are not tolerated. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are also indicated in first line management of heart failure. "
cardiovascular system,378,"If a patient suffers a stroke following a DVT, what is the most likely cardiac abnormality?",Atrial fibrillation,Nil,Patent foramen ovale,Ventricular septal defect,Atrial septal defect,C,A PFO would allow a thrombus from a DVT to reach the cerebral circulation when right heart pressures are increased e.g. following a PE.  AF could potential lead to an embolus and thus a stroke if it developed following a PE secondary to the DVT.
cardiovascular system,379,What s the best indicator of the severity of aortic stenosis?,Character of apex beat,Intensity of murmur,Co Existence of AR,ECG changes,Character of second heart sound,E,"When AS is severe then the second heart sound may be very soft or inaudible.  The physical findings are a slow rising carotid pulse, forceful apex beat and soft first heart sound.  Reversed splitting of the second heart sound can occur as can a fourth heart sound."
cardiovascular system,380,Which of the following is first to rise following myocardial infarction (MI)?,CK-MB,Creatine phosphokinase,Lactate dehydrogenase,Myoglobin,Troponin I,D,"Cardiac troponins are the most widely used test following a myocardial infarct in the UK. Both troponin I and T are highly sensitive and specific for cardiac damage, and are of equal clinical value. Serum levels begin to increase within 3-12 hours from the onset of pain, peak at 24-48 hours and return to baseline over 5-14 days. CK-MB levels also increase within 3-12 hours of onset of chest pain and peak within 24 hours, but return to baseline quicker than troponin (after 48-72 hours). Sensitivity and specificity are not as high as for troponin levels. The most sensitive early marker for myocardial infarction is myoglobin (troponin may not rise until 6 hours following myocyte injury). Myoglobin can be detected within 2 hours of cardiac myocyte damage, but is not specific as it is also present in skeletal muscle. LDH is also less specific than troponin, although the LDH-1 isoenzyme is predominantly found in cardiac muscle so a high LDH-1:LDH-2 ratio can indicate myocardial damage. Levels begin to rise 24-48 hours, peak at 72 hours, and remain elevated for 10 days. It is not widely used in UK practice. AST is very non-specific, and is no longer widely used in the UK. Levels become elevated at 6-10 hours, peak at 24-36 hours and remain high for 3-5 days. Creatinine phosphokinase is the same as creatinine kinase, and is not specific for cardiac damage. "
cardiovascular system,381,"A 45-year-old solicitor had an onset of severe, crushing, substernal chest pain while attending a football match. He collapsed on his way to the car. Bystander cardiorespiratory resuscitation was begun immediately and he is cardioverted for VF by the attending paramedics. He arrives intubated and ventilated in the Emergency Department where his 12 lead ECG shows inferior ST elevation. Blood gas analysis revealed:    pH 7.13 (7.35-7.45)   PaO2 560 mmHg (90-110)   PaCO2 18 mmHg (35-45)   Bicarbonate 5.8 mmol/L (20-30)   SaO2 98% (greater than90)    Based on these laboratory values, which of the following statements best describes his current pathophysiology?",He has a large right to left intracardiac shunt,He is demonstrating a primary respiratory acidosis,His anion gap is likely to be normal,His oxyhaemoglobin curve is shifted to the left,His pulmonary artery pressure is likely to be elevated,E,"This relatively young patient with severe central chest pain has probably arrested due to myocardial infarction and arrhythmia. His gases reveal high PO2 following 100% O2 but severe acidosis due to the arrest and lactic acidosis thus the anion gap would be high. He does not have a primary ventilatory failure as his PO2 is high. There is unlikely to be large right to left shunting as this would cause hypoxaemia/cyanosis which does not correct with oxygen supplementation. The oxygen dissociation curve is shifted to the right in acute acidosis, i.e. haemoglobin has a decreased affinity for oxygen. High pulmonary pressures would be expected after this arrest scenario, as the pulmonary arterioles constrict in response to hypoxia."
cardiovascular system,382,"A 68-year-old man on treatment for an irregular heart beat comes to the emergency depatment. He has palpitations for the last 3 hours. Examination: pulse regular, 154 bpm. Carotid sinus massage settled his pulse down to 80 bpm. What is the most likely rhythm disturbance?",SVT,V-fib,VT,V-ectopics,A-fib,A,Regular tachycardia responding to vagal maneuver is SVT
cardiovascular system,383,"A 48-year-old male is referred with impotence. He has a history of angina, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes. Which one of the following drugs that he takes would present a contraindication to his being able to receive sildenafil?",Aspirin,Bendroflumethiazide,Isosorbide mononitrate,Lisinopril,Metformin,C,"Nitrates and sildenafil are contraindicated due to the precipitant drops in blood pressure. Viagra is also associated with increases in intraocular pressure so should be avoided in glaucoma, hereditary retinal disease, and in those with hypotension."
cardiovascular system,384,How long should you advise a patient not to drive after pacemaker insertion?,One week,One year,Can drive immediately,One month,One day,A,After permanent pacemaker insertion patient's should be advised not to drive for one week.
cardiovascular system,385,Which of the following is correct in a normal electrocardiogram?,"P, QRS and T are mostly positive in lead AVR",The P wave represents repolarisation of the atria,The QRS complex typically shows a small initial positive wave in lead V6,The ST segment is typically more than 1mm above the isoelectric (PT) line,The T wave represents ventricular repolarisation,E,"The P wave represents depolarisation of the atria, the QRS complexes depolarisation of the ventricles and the T wave repolarisation. The Q wave is typically down going in V6. In AVR the p wave, QRS complex and T waves are predominantly negative. An initial upstroke may suggest left bundle branch block. Elevation of the ST segment may be pathogenic due to ischaemia/infarction or ventricular disease."
cardiovascular system,386,On auscultation of a patient's heart you hear a pan-systolic murmur. With which of the following conditions is this murmur associated?,Aortic regurgitation,Coarctation of the aorta,Mitral stenosis,Pulmonary stenosis,Ventricular septal defect,E,"A pansystolic or holosystolic murmur extends from the first heart sound through to the second heart sound which is often hard to hear because of the murmur. It is seen in septal defects and, more commonly, mitral regurgitation."
cardiovascular system,387,A 45-year-old manual worker presented with a 2hour history of chest pain radiating to his left arm. His ECG is normal. What is the single most appropriate investigation?,Cardiac enzymes,CXR,CT,ECG,V/Q scan,A,Probable diagnosis is MI. In MI often ECG doesn’t show the changes in early stage. Cardiac enzymes will help in such cases
cardiovascular system,388,A 22 year old female has been suffering from intermittent palpitations. She states these occur about four times a year and she is finding them increasingly troublesome. A 24 hour ECG is organised and she is found to have paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. She is fit and well otherwise. She was commenced on a beta blocker however could not tolerate the side effects as she was having vivid dreams which were disturbing her sleep. Which of the following could be utilised as an alternative?,Digoxin,Verapamil,Sotalol,Flecainide,Amiodarone,D,"This patient due to the infrequency of the episodes may be suitable for a ""pill in the pocket"" approach. Flecainide can be utilised PRN with the patient only taking it when they are suffering from an episode of AF. This is useful for infrequent episodes and can be used in patients with no past history of structural heart disease, LVF or unstable AF. Sotalol is another option.  A regular betablocker can also be tried. If there is LV dysfunction or the others fail. Amiodarone can be considered. Surgery is also an option where pharmacological therapy has failed or there is evidence of WPW. Digoxin and verapamil are used in rate control."
cardiovascular system,389,A 35-year-old lady at 14 weeks' gestation is found to have a blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg. Her father is known to have hypertension. Electrocardiogram (ECG) demonstrates features of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). What is the most likely diagnosis?,Eclampsia,Chronic hypertension,Pre-eclampsia,Pregnancy-induced hypertension,Renal hypertension,B,"ECG feature of LVH is the key, telling that her hypertension is not of recent onset, ruling out pregnancy-related causes. Of all types of hypertension, chronic hypertension is the most prevalent. Her family history also supports the diagnosis. Hypertensive disorders during pregnancy are classified into 4 categories:- Chronic hypertension Preeclampsia-eclampsia Preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension Gestational hypertension "
cardiovascular system,390,A 70-year-old male with a five year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) presents for annual review with a blood pressure of 188/88 mmHg. Clinical examination was normal. An ECG reveals evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Creatinine is elevated at 152 µmol/L and urine is positive on microalbumin testing. Which one of the following drugs is the most appropriate treatment for this patient's hypertension?,Atenolol,Amlodipine,Bendroflumethiazide,Doxazosin,Valsartan,E,"Regarding the British Hypertension Society guidelines and NICE guidelines on the treatment of BP in type 2 Diabetes, this elderly male with diabetes has isolated systolic hypertension associated with LVH (LVH being defined as a complication of hypertension). Evidence would support the use of a calcium channel blocker and/or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) as first line. In a diabetic patient with evidence of nephropathy or any patient with LVH there is compelling evidence to suggest that ACEI or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be first line treatment for hypertension. "
cardiovascular system,391,"A patient with AF for which he is on digoxin, aspirin and atenolol if found to be in acute renal failure.  What medication changes are essential?",Stop aspirin,Increase dose of digoxin,Stop atenolol,No changes required,Reduce dose of digoxin,E,Digoxin is renally excreted thus its dose must be reduced as it may lead to toxicity.
cardiovascular system,392,A 17-year-old girl was found collapsed and drowsy. Her 12-lead ECG showed a sinus tachycardia of 120 beats per minute with a corrected QT interval of 500 ms (normal less than470). Which of the following drugs is the most likely cause of her presentation?,Amphetamine,Diphenhydramine,Glue sniffing,Methadone,Methanol,B,"You are here given the option of choosing between two drugs that can possibly cause prolongation of QT - diphenhydramine and methadone. However, bearing in mind that the patient has collapsed and is drowsy with a tachycardia, the most likely option is diphenhydramine as the tachycardia is more typical. Many drugs can cause a prolonged QT interval. Amphetamines can cause long QT, but as this is a central nervous system stimulant you would not anticipate the patient to present drowsy."
cardiovascular system,393,Which of the following is true regarding the action of clopidogrel?,It inhibits cyclo-oxygenase,It is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor,It is a hydroxymethyl co-enzyme A inhibitor,It is a selective factor Xa inhibitor,It is an ADP receptor antagonist,E,Clopidogrel prevents platelet aggregation through antagonism of the adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor. It has been shown to reduce mortality from stroke and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in primary prevention studies.
cardiovascular system,394,"A 50-year-old man has a stab wound to his left anterior chest at the level of the 4th ICS. He has a BP 80 mmHg, pulse 130bpm. His neck veins are dilated and his heart sounds are faint. His trachea is central. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?",Cardiac tamponade,Diaphragmatic rupture,Fractured ribs,Tension pneumothorax,Traumatic rupture of aorta,A,"Beck's triad is a collection of three medical signs associated with acute cardiac tamponade, an emergency condition wherein fluid accumulates around the heart and impairs its ability to pump blood. The signs are low arterial blood pressure, distended neck veins, and distant, muffled heart sounds"
cardiovascular system,395,A 65-year-old man with hypertension develops gingival hyperplasia. What is the single most likely cause?,ACEi,Beta blockers,Crohns disease,Nifedipine,Sarcoidosis,D,Gingival hyperplasia is a recognized side effect of calcium channel blockers
cardiovascular system,396,A 40 year old female who is on long term steroids for Polymyalgia Rheumatica presents with sudden onset left hip pain.  This is severe and she is unable to put any pressure on it.  There is no history of trauma.  On examination there is no obvious abnormality however there is a great reduction in left hip flexion and internal and external rotation.  A hip x-ray reveals sclerosis of the femoral head.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Osteoarthritis,Pathological fracture,Osteomyelitis,Avascular necrosis,Impacted hip fracture,D,"The most likely diagnosis is avascular necrosis secondary to steroid use.  Sclerosis on an X-ray is an early feature.  OA is unlikely due to the sudden onset and the age of the patient.  Often the most early feature in OA is limitation of internal rotation and pain.  Pathological fracture, Osteomyelitis and Impacted fracture are not suggested on the history or xray.  Bone scan or MRI are useful to confirm the diagnosis of avascular necrosis."
cardiovascular system,397,"A patient has just suffered a STEMI and is now found to be in complete heart block.  What vessel is likely to have been involved?
",Left circumflex artery,Left marginal artery,Left anterior descending artery,Right coronary artery,Left coronary artery,D,Conduction defects most commonly complicate inferior STEMIs.  The inferior portion of the heart in the ajority of people is supplied by the right coronary artery.
cardiovascular system,398,"A 55 year old man with poor dentition, has infective endocarditis. He presents with night sweats and lethargy to his e GP. Blood cultures are taken and grow Strep Viridans. Examination reveals splinter haemorrhages and a pyrexia of 37.8 C. On auscultation his chest is clear however there is evidence of a systolic murmur. Investigations revealed a Hb of 10.1 g/dL, WCC of 15.0 x109, an ESR of 101 and Acute Renal Failure. His ECG reveals a PR interval of 140 and an ECHO reveals vegetations on the mitral valve and mitral regurgitation. After 12 days of antibiotics intravenously, urgent surgical intervention is required for?",Large mobile vegetation on mitral valve,Prolonged PR Interval,Systolic Murmur,Continually high ESR,Pyrexia,B,The correct answer is the prolongation of PR interval as this implies that the myocardium has been affected and there may be formation of an abscess. If there is evidence of regurgitation with heart failure or obstruction of the valve this is another indication for surgery. If there is rupture into the pericardium immediate referral is required. Neither continued pyrexia or raised ESR are indications for surgical intervention.
cardiovascular system,399,A 28 year old male presents with shortness of breath on exertion.  On examination he is very tall and thin with long fingers.  On auscultation the chest is clear however you note an early diastolic murmur which is low pitched best heard at the aortic area and lower left sternal edge (louder in expiration) and a late diastolic murmur heard at the apex.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Mitral stenosis,Mitral valve prolapse,Aortic regurgitation,Aortic stenosis,Mitral Regurgitation,C,"The clinical features on being very tall and thin are hinting that this patient has Marfans Syndrome.  There are at increased risk of developing aortic regurgitation which can lead to dyspnoea on exertion, syncope, chest pain and heart failure.  It can lead to a displaced apex beat and classically there is a low pitched early diastolic murmur best heard at the LLSE and aortic areas.  There can also be a late diastolic (Austin Flint) murmur due to the flow from the regurgitant jet impinging on the mitral valve leaflet leading to a late diatolic murmur at the apex.  S1 is soft.  Mitral stenosis leads to a late diatolic murmur alone although can be associated with a Graham Steel murmur if there is pulmonary hypertension however this is less likely than AR.  AS and MR both lead to systolic murmurs."
cardiovascular system,400,"A 70-year-old lady on Raloxifene for osteoporosis has recently to the UK from Australia. She now presents with severe chest pain, SOB and suddenly collapsed in the emergency department. What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?",MI,Aortic dissection,Pulmonary embolism,Costochondritis,Pneumothorax,C,Prolonged air travel is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism
cardiovascular system,401,A 70 year old female has had several syncopal episodes.  On auscultation there is an ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aortic stenosis,Simple vasovagal episodes,Mitral regurgitation,Arrhythmia,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,A,Aortic stenosis leads to an ejection systolic murmur radiating to the carotids.  It can lead to anginal symptoms and syncopal episodes as in this case and heart failure.  There has been some association with haemorrhagic telangiectasia and GI bleeding.  MR leads to a pansystolic murmur radiating to the axillae.   An arrhythmia may be occurring but given the presence of a murmur aortic stenosis is more likely.
cardiovascular system,402,"Which finding, on clinical examination of the pulse, suggests a diagnosis of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM)?",Irregularly irregular pulse,Pulsus alternans,Pulsus bigeminus,Pulsus bisferiens,Pulsus paradoxus,D,"Pulsus bisferiens, is a sign where, on palpation of the pulse, a double peak per cardiac cycle can be appreciated.

cardiovascular system,403,Which of the following is true regarding atrial fibrillation?,Is an absolute contraindication for elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm,Is an uncommon arrhythmia in post-operative patients,May be caused by pulmonary embolism,May result from hypothyroidism,Requires DC cardioversion in post-operative patients,C,"Atrial fibrillation may arise secondary to:  Ischaemic heart disease Mitral valve disease Rheumatic heart disease Hypertension Cardiomyopathy Pericarditis, and Thyrotoxicosis.  Conditions that raise the atrial pressure, such as increased atrial muscle mass, atrial fibrosis, or inflammation and infiltration of the atrium, may also lead to atrial fibrillation. It is a common arrhythmia, occurring in approximately 5-10% of patients over 65 years of age. It is not a contraindication for patients having major surgery. It is common in post-operative surgical patients and the most frequent cause is dehydration. Pain could also be a contributing factor. In the absence of an obvious predisposing cause, such as dehydration or thyrotoxicosis, conditions such as a myocardial event or pulmonary embolism should be ruled out. The majority of post-operative atrial fibrillation settles if the predisposing factor is addressed; otherwise treatment with digoxin is the first line of management. DC cardioversion is indicated only if the patient becomes haemodynamically unstable, or is refractory to appropriate medications."
cardiovascular system,404,"A 54-year-old obese man with a history of angina and hypertension presents with central crushing chest pain of two hours duration. High flow oxygen, sublingual GTN, and aspirin are administered and venous access is obtained. Whilst being attached to an ECG monitor he collapses, with a doctor present, and the initial rhythm is pulseless ventricular tachycardia (VT). The external defibrillator is located two minutes away on another ward. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate treatment for this man?",A ventilation to compression ratio of 30:2 should be commenced,"Await arrival of defibrillator, then deliver shock",Continuous chest compressions should be started,He should be given a precordial thump followed by chest compressions,Intravenous adrenaline should be given,D,"Guidelines from the Resuscitation Council (UK) state that if a patient has a monitored and witnessed VF/VT arrest in hospital, three quick successive (stacked) shocks should be given. Chest compressions should be started immediately after the third, with a compression to ventilation ratio of 30:2 for 2 minutes. A precordial thump can be successful if given within seconds of the onset of a shockable rhythm. Delivery should not delay calling for help, or accessing a defibrillator, but would be indicated here whilst awaiting the defibrillator. Chest compressions should start immediately if it is unsuccessful. Intravenous adrenaline would be given every 3-5 minutes once chest compressions had started. "

What is the cause of her death?",Acute MI,DKA,Pulmonary embolism,Acute pericarditis,Cardiac tamponade,C,Immobilization due to hip pain may resulted in DVT and later pulmonary embolism
cardiovascular system,406,A 25-year-old female who is 20 weeks pregnant with her first child is admitted with palpitations. The ECG reveals a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and this self terminates 20 minutes after admission. Subsequently she has further runs of symptomatic SVT. Which would be the most appropriate treatment for this patient's paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia?,Amiodarone,Disopyramide,Flecainide,Metoprolol,Verapamil,D,"Tachyarrhythmias may increase during pregnancy although the causes are not entirely clear. Regarding the termination of acute SVT, adenosine appears to be safe in pregnancy. In the case of the prevention of recurrent SVT then verapamil or beta blockers have data supporting their use. Current AHA/EHA criteria for the treatment of SVTs in pregnancy do suggest using metoprolol (level of evidence 1B) rather than verapamil (C), although they recommend avoiding the former in the first trimester."

cardiovascular system,408,"A 69-year-old man is treated for chest infection. He has been on a stable dose of warfarin for the last six months as a treatment for atrial fibrillation, with INR recordings between 2-2.5. However, his most recent INR was 5 (less than1.4). Which one of the following drugs that has recently been started is likely to be responsible for the increased INR?",Clarithromycin,Co-dydramol,Digoxin,Rifampicin,Temazepam,A,"Clarithromycin increases the anticoagulant effect of warfarin, through cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition. Patients who receive clarithromycin (or other macrolides) whilst on warfarin should have their INR closely monitored, as the dose may need to be reduced to avoid an unsafe INR. Rifampicin is a P450 enzyme inducer and would reduce the anticoagulant effect. Ciprofloxacin and sulphonamides will also increase the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. Temazepam, digoxin, and codeine have no appreciable effect on warfarin metabolism."
cardiovascular system,409,A 65-year-old woman presents with heart failure. Her echocardiogram shows a restrictive cardiomyopathy but with structurally normal valves. Which one of the following is the most likely cause?,Amyloidosis,Coxsackie infection,Down's syndrome,Marfan's syndrome,Turner's syndrome ,A,The diagnosis is amyloidosis which typically causes an infiltrative restrictive cardiomyopathy in patients of this age group. Other causes include:  Sarcoidosis Radiotherapy Systemic sclerosis Carcinoid syndrome.  Coxsackie produces a viral myocarditis with the likelihood of a dilated appearance on echo. Marfan's is likely to cause valvular regurgitant defects and a dilated cardiomyopathy. Down's syndrome is more likely to be associated with AV canal defects and consequent dilatation. Turner's syndrome is associated with atrial septal defects and coarctation and bicuspid valvular defects.

There is a long list of relative and absolute indications for permanent pacemakers. These are based on international guidelines.  Complete heart block (whether symptomatic or not) is a indication for a permanent pacemaker as there is an inherent risk of asystole. Mobitz Type I with symptoms is a relative indication. Generally, permanent pacing can be justified for any degree of heart block associated with symptoms of bradycardia. Bifascicular block and trifascicular block are only absolute indications if they are associated with heart block."

This patient needs beta-blockade to reduce her BP and myocardial oxygen demand and investigation to confirm the diagnosis. Most emergency departments have rapid access to CT aortogram and this is the investigation of choice. Regarding type A dissection, progression to surgery is inevitable. The underlying clinical features are suggestive of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome which puts her at high risk of vascular rupture/dissections. Alteplase is used in thrombolysis of suspected CVA. Angioplasty is used in coronary artery stenosis leading to myocardial infarction Heparin is used in venous thromboembolic disease and nitrates in angina."

You suspect HOCM, which of the following is associated with increased risk of sudden death?",Age,Degree of left ventricular hypertrophy,Family history of sudden death,Asymmetrical septal hypertrophy,Loudness of murmur,B,The most strongly correlated is the degree of LVH. Previously documented VT is also a risk factor.
cardiovascular system,416,"In a normal heart, the oxygen saturation of a sample of blood taken from a catheter in the pulmonary capillary wedge position should be equal to a sample from which of the following?",Coronary sinus,Femoral artery,Pulmonary artery,Right atrium,Right ventricle,B,"This is a tricky question, but hopefully the following explanation will aid your understanding. Catheters placed in the pulmonary capillary wedge position are used to provide an indirect estimate of left atrial pressure. Left ventricular pressure can be directly measured with a catheter within the left ventricle, but this cannot be advanced into the left atrium. Left atrial pressure can be measured directly by punching through the interatrial septum from the right septum, but the potential for harm with this method is high. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is therefore measured by inserting a balloon-tipped, multilumen Swan-Ganz catheter into a peripheral vein which is then advanced into the right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and then a branch of the pulmonary artery. There is a small balloon just behind the tip of the catheter, which is inflated with air. There are two openings in the catheter: one distal to the balloon and one several centimetres proximal to the balloon. These can be connected to pressure transducers, or used to measure the oxygen saturations of blood. When properly positioned, the distal port measures pulmonary artery pressure (~25/10 mmHg) and the proximal port measures right atrial pressure (~0-3 mmHg). The balloon is then inflated, which occludes the branch of the pulmonary artery. When this occurs, the pressure in the distal port rapidly falls, and after several seconds reaches a stable lower value that is very similar to left atrial pressure (normally ~8-10 mmHg). This is because the occluded vessel and its distal branches that eventually form the pulmonary veins act as a long catheter that measures the blood pressures within the pulmonary veins and left atrium. After aspirating enough volume (5-7 ml) to clear the blood from the pulmonary artery distal to the inflated balloon, the oxygen saturation should be similar to that measured by arterial blood gas (e.g. of femoral artery) or pulse oximetry."

cardiovascular system,418,A 35-year-old woman has pain in her calves which develops after walking around 150 yards. The pain settles with rest. She has yellow discolouration of her palmar creases and a corneal arcus. Fasting lipid profile:    Cholesterol 9.6 mmol/L (less than5)   Triglycerides 7.3 mmol/L (less than2)    Which is the most likely diagnosis?,Chylomicronaemia,Familial hypercholesterolaemia,Hypoalphalipoproteinaemia,Type III hyperlipidaemia,Type IV hyperlipidaemia,D,"Remnant hyperlipidaemia (type III hyperlipidaemia) is a rare disorder associated with:  Hypercholesterolaemia, typically 8-12 mmol/L Hypertriglyceridaemia, typically 5-20 mmol/L Normal ApoB concentration Palmar xanthomata - orange discoloration of skin creases Tuberoeruptive xanthomata - elbows and knees Early onset of cardiovascular disease Early onset of peripheral vascular disease.  Remnant hyperlipidaemia is due to a combination of abnormal ApoE receptor function (which is normally required for clearance of chylomicron remnants and IDL from the circulation) and a metabolic disorder such as diabetes, obesity or hypothyroidism. The receptor defect causes levels of chylomicron remnants and IDL to be higher than normal in the blood stream. The receptor defect is an autosomal recessive mutation or polymorphism.The genotype of the homozygous condition is apo E-2/E-2 and occurs with a frequency of 1:100. The disorder responds well to treating the metabolic condition and lipid lowering medication. Hyperlipidaemias are classified according to the Fredrickson classification. Chylomicronaemia (type I) is associated particularly with severe hypertriglyceridaemia and not with large elevations in cholesterol. There is no increased risk of atherosclerotic disease. Hypoalphalipoproteinaemia is a rare, familial condition and is associated with low HDL. Familial hypercholesterolaemia (type IIa) is due to LDL-receptor deficiency, and is not associated with elevated triglyceride levels. In type IV hyperlipidaemia cholesterol levels are within the normal range and triglyceride level are elevated. VLDL levels are also elevated."

cardiovascular system,423,A 67 year old male presents to his GP with a cold right hand. He has had a previous coronary artery bypass graft 3 years ago. Over the last few months he has noticed his hand being cold and painful. It occurs at rest and is not worsened by any particular movements. On examination his capillary refill time is slowed to about 3 seconds. The hand is cold and the radial pulse is impalpable. The rest of the examination is normal. He has not had an angina attack for some time. What is the most likely cause?,Embolism,Raynaud's Phenomenon,Atherosclerosis of the radial artery,Ulnar artery trauma,Radial artery trauma,E,This patient has had a CABG in the past. This means the radial artery may have been utilised for catheterisation. This can cause trauma to the radial artery and if this does not recanalise and there is significant athersclerosis to the ulnar artery this can lead to a compromised blood supply to the hand. In some patients the radial artery can be used for grafting. Subclavian stenosis can occur following CABG when the internal mammary artery is utilised however this does not typical present in this fashion as there is intermittent arm claudication worsened with arm raised above the head and there can be a steal syndrome leading to angina.

The murmur may be heard at the apex but is usually loudest at the LSE. Very small defects may generate an early/late systolic murmur. Fixed splitting of the heart sounds usually accompanies atrial septal defects."
cardiovascular system,425,"A 50-year-old man with hypertension already on furosemide, ramipril and digoxin is found to have poor left ventricular function on echocardiogram. Which antihypertensive should be added?",Carvedilol,Diltiazem,Doxazosin,Hydralazine,Nifedipine,A,"This patient has hypertension and reduced ejection fraction on echo, indicating an element of failure. In these circumstances the most appropriate agent with evidence to support its use for reducing morbidity and mortality in failure would be the addition of a beta blocker. All of the other options have little evidence for improved outcomes in heart failure, though some may improve symptoms."
cardiovascular system,426,Which of the following antiarrhythmic drugs may be used in the treatment of long QT syndrome?,Amiodarone,Atenolol,Flecainide,Propafenone,Sotalol ,B,"Beta blockers are the mainstay of treatment in long QT syndrome. The most commonly used drugs are propranolol and nadolol, but metoprolol and atenolol are also used. Sotalol is a complex drug, and although it is classified as a beta blocker it is in fact a mix of the d and l isomers which have quite different effects. The d isomer prolongs repolarisation, resulting in a class III anti-arrhythmic effect. The l isomer acts to both prolong repolarisation and also as a beta blocker. The beta blocker effect is dose-dependent and is not cardio-selective. The overall action of sotalol is to prolong the QT interval, and therefore it is not used in this situation. Implantable cardioverter defibrillators are the most effective treatment in high risk cases. The others drugs may produce a prolongation of the QT interval, exacerbating risk of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) and torsades de pointes. Further Reading ECG Library.

There is a harsh pansystolic murmur at the LLSE which can be associated with a thrill. However there is not normally ECG or CXR changes in a small VSD. In moderate VSD there is a displaced apex beat and evidence of a parasternal heave. There is normally LAD and LVH on ECGs and there may be CXR changes such as cardiomegaly or increased pulmonary vasculature. In large VSD the murmur may be less obvious and there will be features of pulmonary hypertension.

What is the diagnosis?,Pulmonary embolism,MI,Tension pneumothorax,Fat embolism,None,A,History of surgery (particularly when patients are immobile like hip surgery) followed by chest pain and breathlessness strongly suggests diagnosis of pulmonary embolism
cardiovascular system,433,A 57-year-old male is admitted with acute dyspnoea and chest pain. A pulmonary embolism (PE) is confirmed. Which of the following is a recognised feature of a significant pulmonary embolism?,An arterial pH less than 7.2,An increase in serum troponin levels,Blood gases show increased pCO2 on air,Normal D-dimer levels,Reduced plasma lactate levels,B,"Cardiac troponins are reliable markers of myocardial injury that are increasingly being used to diagnose an acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with undifferentiated chest pain or dyspnoea. If elevated cardiac troponin levels also occur in patients with pulmonary embolism because of right ventricular dilation and myocardial injury, such patients could be misdiagnosed. 'We performed a prospective cohort study to determine the prevalence of elevated cardiac troponin I (cTnI) levels in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism. Methods: Consecutive patients with objectively confirmed submassive pulmonary embolism and no previous history of ischemic heart disease, other cardiac disease or renal insufficiency, were included. Creatine kinase and cTnI levels were measured within 24 hours of clinical presentation on two occasions eight to 12 hours apart. Results: Of 24 patients with submassive pulmonary embolism, five (20.8%) had elevated cTnI levels of 0.4 microg/L or higher (95% confidence interval, 7.1-42.2%). One of these patients had a cTnI level higher than 2.3 µg/L that was suggestive of myocardial infarction. Conclusion: Pulmonary embolism should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with undifferentiated chest pain or dyspnoea and an elevated cardiac troponin level.' (Arch Intern Med, 162(1): 79-81 2002) Hypoxaemia and hypocapnoea are common after major pulmonary embolism and may also be found after more minor events. Absence of these phenomena, on the other hand, by no means excludes embolism and their presence is non-specific. In suspected minor embolism this investigation is, at best, only of marginal value. The precise stimulus to hyperventilation is unknown and there is also difficulty in understanding the reasons for hypoxaemia when it is present."
cardiovascular system,434,"A 42 year old female with rheumatoid arthritis presents with dyspnoea, fatigue and ankle swelling. An ECG reveals 2:1 heart block and an echo is performed and reveals ventricular wall thickening with granular sparkling of left ventricle and dilated atria. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Pericarditis,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Cardiac amyloid,Restrictive cardiomyopathy,Dilated cardiomyopathy,C,The Echo is indicative of a restrictive infiltrative pattern which is indicative of cardiac amyloid and is presenting with heart failure. It can also lead to 2:1 heart block as in this case and complete heart block. Digoxin should be avoided as this can make this more likely. The Echo is characteristic of cardiac amyloid and excludes the other diagnoses.
cardiovascular system,435,Which one of the following is a feature of symptomatic carotid artery stenosis?,Ataxia,Central retinal artery occlusion,Drop attacks,Episodic vertigo,Ipsilateral hemiplegia,B,"Signs typical of the anterior (carotid) territory include:  Ipsilateral retinal artery occlusion/amaurosis fugax Contralateral hemiplegia Dysphasia, and Sensory loss.  Features of the vertebrobasilar artery include vertigo/drop attacks, ataxia and vertigo. Guidelines for the management of carotid stenosis are based on the degree of vessel stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended as first-line treatment for symptomatic low-risk surgical patients with stenosis of 50-99% and asymptomatic patients with stenosis of 60-99%. Carotid revascularization is appropriate for symptomatic patients with recent stable stroke and greater than50% stenosis. CEA should be performed early, ideally within two weeks of the last retinal or cerebral ischaemic event in patients with ≥50-99% symptomatic stenosis.

cardiovascular system,436,"A 21-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy presents in clinic with dizzy spells but has not had any syncopal episodes. Which of the following, if present, would indicate an increased risk of sudden cardiac death?",A significant blood pressure drop during exercise,Asymmetric septal hypertrophy with maximum wall thickness of 2.1 cm,Left ventricular outflow tract gradient of 80 mmHg,Systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve on echocardiography,Worsening exertional angina,A,"Patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) are at increased risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation/tachycardia (VF/VT). The five poor prognostic markers which are predictive of sudden cardiac death are:  Syncope Family history of HCM and sudden cardiac death Maximum left ventricular wall thickness greater than 3 cm Blood pressure drop during peak exercise on stress testing, and Documented runs of non-sustained VT on 24 hour tape.  Left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction causes symptoms and can lead to deterioration of LV function but does not predict sudden cardiac death. Asymmetric septal hypertrophy is a feature of HCM. In order to assess the risk for sudden cardiac death a detailed echocardiogram with measurements of the maximum left ventricular wall thickness is required. Systolic anterior movement of the mitral valve is often seen on echocardiogram and is thought to be the mechanism behind the left ventricular outflow tract obstruction."

The findings on examination, ECG, and CXR effectively rule out structural heart disease or congenital rhythm disturbance, meaning the other options must be incorrect. VT associated with exercise is normally non-sustained and has no significant impact on mortality, but the syncopal episode here should prompt further investigation including Holter and exercise ECG to evaluate any need for beta blockade to prevent further episodes. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity is most commonly seen in the elderly with syncopal episodes associated with pressure on the neck/carotid body, long QT is ruled out by the 12 lead ECG, and HOCM is associated with abnormal findings on clinical examination.  Brugada syndrome is also diagnosed by characteristic ECG findings: ST segment elevation in the precordial leads (V1-3)."
cardiovascular system,438,Which of the following would you expect to see on an ECG of a patient with hypercalcaemia?,Left axis deviation,T wave inversion,Prolonged QT interval,Tall tented T waves,Shortened QT interval,E,A shortened QT interval would be seen on the ECG of a patient with hypercalcaemia.
cardiovascular system,439,A 40-year-old man collapsed at home and died. The GPs report says he suffered from T2DM and BMI=35. What is the most likely cause of death?,MI (myocardial infarction),DM (diabetes mellitus),HF (heart failure),PE (pulmonary embolism),Renal failure,A,Diabetes mellitus and obesity are risk factors to developing MI. In diabetics MI pain is not felt if there occurs autonomic neuropathy. But if there is no autonomic neuropathy diabetics will feel the pain of MI
cardiovascular system,440,"A 60 year old woman has a history of PAF for which she is on warfarin and amiodarone, hypercholesterolaemia for which she takes simvastatin and hypertension on bendroflumethiazide and ramipril.  She is suffering from recurrent UTIs and has been advised to drink cranberry juice.  What is cranberry juice likely to interact with?",Amiodarone,Bendroflumethiazide,Ramipril,Warfarin,Simvastatin,D,Cranberry juice can cause inhibition of cytochrome P450 and thus should avoided with warfarin.
cardiovascular system,441,"Mrs PL is taking digoxin for heart failure. Which of the following drugs, if added to her prescription, would predispose Mrs PL to digoxin toxicity?",Bumetanide,Codeine,Paracetamol,Phenytoin,St John's wort,A,"Bumetanide is a loop diuretic and may cause hypokalaemia as a side effect. The potassium loss caused by bumetanide increases the toxicity of digoxin. A comparative study of the medical records of 418 patients taking digitalis over the period 1950 to 1952, and of 679 patients over the period 1964 to 1966, found that the incidence of digitalis toxicity had more than doubled.^1 Of the earlier group 8.6% developed toxicity compared with 17.2% of the latter group (81% taking diuretics, mainly chlorothiazides, furosemide, ethacrynic acid, chlortalidone). It was concluded that the increased toxicity was related to the increased usage of potassium-depleting diuretics. "
cardiovascular system,442,"A 70-year-old woman has a history of dyspnoea and palpitations for six months. An ECG at that time showed atrial fibrillation. She was given digoxin, diuretics, and aspirin. She now presents with two short lived episodes of altered sensation in the left face, left arm, and leg. There is poor coordination of the left hand. ECHO was normal as was a CT head scan. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",Anticoagulation,Carotid endarterectomy,Clopidogrel,Corticosteroid treatment,No action,A,This patient is having symptoms of transient ischaemic attacks most likely due to a cardiac source of emboli. A normal echocardiogram (ECHO) or computerised tomography (CT) scan head does not rule out thromboembolic events. There is an increased risk of strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation and hence with the given symptoms formal anticoagulation with warfarin should be considered.
cardiovascular system,443,"A 35-year-old healthy woman has a faint systolic murmur on physical examination. An echocardiogram is performed, and she is found to have a bicuspid aortic valve. In explaining the meaning of this finding to her, which is the most appropriate statement?",An aortic valve replacement is eventually likely to be required,Other family members are likely to have the same condition,She should be treated with a cholesterol lowering agent,The problem has resulted from past injection drug usage,This is one manifestation of an underlying autoimmune disease process,A,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is perhaps the most common form of congenital heart disease in adults (1-2% of population). Bicuspid valves have a propensity to wear out and calcify with ageing. Different studies have shown different levels of heritability for biscupid valves. It is possible that up to a third of relatives of patients with a bicuspid valve have valve or aortic abnormalities (often a dilated aorta). However, other studies have shown the prevalence of abnormalities in relatives to be much lower. The European Society of Cardiology states than there is an estimated 10% chance of a first degree relative being affected, which increases to 20-30% if you consider aortopathy. NOTCH1 gene mutations may be responsible. The difficulty answering this question lies with the fact that it is a single best answer question - i.e. more than one option could be correct, but one is more correct than the other.  The statement andquot;other family members are likely to have the same conditionandquot; suggests that their risk of having a bicuspid aortic value is more than 50%. This is not supported by the research.  Only 15% of patients with a bicuspid aortic valve will have a normally functioning valve in the fifth decade, and this often continues to deteriorate with age. Therefore, ultimately, the majority of patients will reach the indications for surgical replacement of the valve. Therefore option 1 is the MOST CORRECT of those given. "
cardiovascular system,444,"A 50 year old female prents with shortness of breath, fatigue and peripheral oedema.  On examination she has a raised JVP, pitting oedema, hepatomegaly and ascites.  An echo is organised and reveals globally thickened walls oncluding the interatrial septa with atrial dilatation but the ventricles are not dilated.  There is an increased scintillation pattern (granular speckling). There is a normal ejection fraction.  An ECG shows low voltage complexes.  Given the most likely diagnosis, which drug should she be advised to avoid?",Ramipril,Digoxin,Furosemide,Amiodarone,Bendroflumethiazide,B,The most likely diagnosis is restrictive cardiomyopathy given the clinical features and echo findings.  The clinical findings are similar to those of contrictive pericarditis howver the echo in this condition would reveal thickened calcified pericardium and normal wall thickness.  Due to the atrial dilatation thrombus formation can occur and patients may present with embolic symptoms.  Patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy most likely secondary to amyloidosis should avoid digoxin as it is thought that digoxin may bind to amyloid fibrils and lead to increased toxicity.  There I some suggestion that calcium channel blockers and beta blockers should also be avoided.
cardiovascular system,445,"A 67-year-old man is referred with symptoms of fatigue and a low-grade fever. He has lost a few pounds in weight over the past few weeks and suffered from persistent night sweats. Past history of note includes chronic gum disease and a number of broken teeth. He is also allergic to penicillin. On examination, he has a temperature of 37.8°C, and his BP is 105/70 mmHg with a pulse of 95. There are splinter haemorrhages on examination of the fingers on both hands. He has a systolic murmur loudest in the mitral area. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 108 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 11.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 201 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.5 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 135 μmol/L (60-120)   C-reactive protein 125 mg/L (less than10)    Which of the following is the most appropriate empirical antibiotic regime?",Benzylpenicillin and gentamicin,Ceftazidime and metronidazole,Flucloxacillin and gentamicin,Linezolid and gentamicin,Vancomycin and gentamicin,E,"Viridans or Bovis streptococci would figure very high on the index of suspicion, as causes of endocarditis here. As such, in the presence of penicillin allergy, guidelines from the Royal College recommend vancomycin and gentamicin combination therapy as the best alternative to benzylpenicillin and gentamicin. Flucloxacillin and gentamicin is the regime of choice for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, with linezolid an appropriate alternative in MRSA."
cardiovascular system,446,A patient presents with atrial fibrillation which later reverts to sinus rhythm. In which of the following circumstances is the patient more likely to remain in sinus rhythm?,Age more than 75-years-old,Been commenced on warfarin,Left atrium size greater than 6 cm on ECHO,Short history of AF,Ventricular rate on presentation of 130 bpm,D,"The patient with very recent onset of atrial fibrillation is more likely to stay in sinus rhythm. Atrial fibrillation in older patients is more likely to be associated with structural heart disease. Anticoagulation should have no effect on the risk of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. An enlarged left atrium is unlikely to remain in sinus rhythm. Fast AF can occur in a number of different circumstances. The first is when the patient has just flipped from sinus rhythm into atrial fibrillation, often due to an external insult (such as infection). The second possibility is that they have been in atrial fibrillation for a period of time and another condition is causing the fast ventricular rate (such as infection or dehydration). The two different situations carry a different chance of reverting to sinus rhythm. Those presenting with a relatively slow ventricular rate and, especially if they are not on beta blockers, calcium antagonists or digoxin, are likely to have chronic atrial fibrillation. A short history of atrial fibrillation is more associated with successful cardioversion and therefore this is the most correct answer here."
cardiovascular system,447,A study reveals an immediate rise in blood pressure following infusion of a hormone in normal volunteers. Which of the following is the most likely hormone used in this study?,Angiotensin I,Angiotensin II,Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP),Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP),Prolactin,B,"Angiotensin II, when infused intravenously, produces an immediate rise in blood pressure being a potent vasoconstrictor. Both BNP and ANP result in natriuresis and lowering of blood pressure. Prolactin has no specific effect."
cardiovascular system,448,A 39 year old female who is being treated for hypertension and has recently commenced ramipril presents with sudden onset shortness of breath. His is has a regular pulse but is tachycardic and his heart sounds are pure. On auscultation of the chest there is bibasal crackles. What is the most likely underlying cause?,Silent STEMI,Hypertension,Ischaemic heart disease,Renal artery stenosis,Atrial Fibrillation,D,This patient is likely to have renal artery stenosis and the ACE-I may have precipitated ARF and flash pulmonary oedema secondary to this. His pulse is regular thus this excludes AF. IHD and STEMI are much less likely considering the patients age and there is nothing indicative of this in the history.
cardiovascular system,449,The existence of atrial fibrillation with mitral stenosis results in which of the following?,Large a wave,Disappearance of a wave and large V wave,Large a wave and v wave,Deep x and y descents,Nil,B,Mitral stenosis leads to a large a wave due to pulmonary hypertension. In the presence of atrial fibrillation the a wave disappears as this is produced by atrial systole and a large v wave is evident.
cardiovascular system,450,Which of the following is true concerning the central venous pressure (CVP) trace?,The C wave represents atrial contraction,The V wave represents ventricular contraction,Third degree heart block causes canon A waves,Tricuspid regurgitation causes large A waves,X descent occurs between the A and C waves,C,A waves represent atrial contraction. C waves correspond to the tricuspid valve bulging into the atrium during right ventricle contraction. V waves represent atrial filling with a closed tricuspid valve. X descent occurs following the C wave. Large A waves occur with right ventricular hypertrophy and complete heart block. Tricuspid regurgitation causes giant V waves. 
cardiovascular system,451,A 48-year-old man presents with acute coronary syndrome. On examination he has palmar crease xanthoma. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis of his lipid abnormalities?,Familial combined hyperlipidaemia,Familial hypercholesterolaemia,Familial hypertriglyceridaemia,Lipoprotein lipase deficiency,Remnant hyperlipidaemia,E,Palmar crease xanthoma are associated with remnant hyperlipidaemia (type III hyperlipidaemia).
cardiovascular system,452,"A 25-year-old, previously healthy, woman has worsening fatigue with dyspnoea, palpitations, and fever over the past one week. Her vital signs on admission to the hospital show temperature 38.9°C, respiratory rate 30/min, pulse 105 bpm, and BP 95/65 mmHg. Her heart rate is irregular. An ECG shows diffuse ST-T segment changes. A chest x ray shows mild cardiomegaly. An echocardiogram shows slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation, but no valvular vegetations. Her troponin I is 12 ng/mL (less than0.04). She recovers over the next two weeks with no apparent sequelae. Which of the following laboratory test findings best explains the underlying aetiology for these events?",ANCA titre of 1:80,Anti-streptolysin O titre of 1:512,"Blood culture positive for streptococcus, viridans group",Coxsackie B serologic titre of 1:160,Total serum cholesterol of 9.6 mmol/l,D,"She has findings that suggest myocarditis, and this is supported by the temperature, echo findings, and markedly raised troponin. Myocarditis can have features similar to cardiomyopathy and the mild valvular disease is quite compatible. One of the most likely organisms is Coxsackie B virus. Other more rare cause of myocarditis include vaccine induced and other viral illness such as COVID-19."
cardiovascular system,453,"A 77-year-old man is brought to the Emergency Department with two hours of severe peri-umbilical pain radiating to the back. He is anxious, pale, sweaty and mildly cyanosed. His pulse rate is 126/min and blood pressure is 80/60 mmHg. There is s a slightly tender mass just to the left of the umbilicus. Bowel sounds are normal. His femoral pulses are difficult to feel. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute diverticulitis,Acute pancreatitis,Adhesive small bowel obstruction,Perforated sigmoid colon,Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm,E,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm, the commonest aortic aneurysm, is more common in males than females. The other risk factors include:  Smoking Hypertension A positive family history, and Increasing age.  Rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm is commonly seen in men over 60 years of age. These aneurysms most often rupture into the retroperitoneal space, resulting in epigastric/peri-umbilical pain, with the pain radiating to the back or lumbar region, a pulsatile abdominal mass and signs of hypovolaemic shock. Abdominal ultrasound, CT or an MRI scan may be indicated to diagnose or assess the progress of an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Ruptures are either diagnosed clinically or more commonly via CT. CT is the investigation of choice for a suspected ruptured aneurysm. CT scans allow definate diagnosis of a rupture as well as detailed information of aneurysm morphology to help plan repair.Immediate surgery to identify the rupture and stem the blood loss is imperative in cases of ruptured aneurysm. Delay in diagnosis and/or treatment may be fatal."
cardiovascular system,454,What investigation is utilised to screen first degree relatives with HOCM?,Echocardiography,Nil required,Genetic screening,CT of Heart,MRI of heart,A,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant and due to its significant risk of mortality screening should be performed.  An echo is the most appropriate which should show an increased wall thickness which exceeds two standard deviations for sex, age, and size matched populations approximately 1.5 cm or greater in thickness."
cardiovascular system,455,A 50-year-old male has a blood pressure of 160/90 mmHg on two consecutive days. You decide that you are going to initiate drug therapy. Which of the following statements regarding your decision is correct?,ACE inhibitors should not be used as first line treatment in Afro-Caribbean patients,An alpha-blocker would be a first line agent in this patient,If the patient is non-caucasian a beta blocker would be an appropriate first line treatment,Potassium monitoring is not required if an ACE inhibitor is prescribed without the addition of spironalactone,Spironalactone would be an appropriate second line agent in this patient,A,ACE inhibitors have low efficacy in black patients in the clinical trials of ACE inhibitors. According to the British Hypertension Society guidelines (J Hum Hypertension 2003;17:81-86) first line treatment in black patients and patients older than 55 years of age should be with a diuretic or a calcium channel blocker. An alpha blocker or spironalactone should only be used as an adjunct treatment in resistant hypertension.
cardiovascular system,456,A 69-year-old man presents with sudden onset tearing chest pain that radiates through to his back. He is sweaty. His BP is 160/90 mmHg and pulse 95 bpm. A CXR shows a widened mediastinum and CT scan confirms an aortic dissection of the descending aorta. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management of this patient?,Immediate surgical referral,IV labetolol,Observe on high dependency unit,Refer for cardiac catherisation,Verapamil orally,B,Advances in the understanding of this disease have established that lesions limited to the descending aorta (type B) generally have better survival compared with those involving the ascending aorta. Current recommendations support the use of beta blockers as the initial management with an increasing number of endovascular and surgical techniques being used as local expertise dictates. 
cardiovascular system,457,For which of the following are β blockers not recommended as first line therapy?,Angina,Chronic heart failure,Hypertension,Myocardial infarction,Permanent atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular rate (haemodynamically stable),C,The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on Hypertension advise against using beta blockers as routine 'first line' therapy for uncomplicated hypertension. Review of several randomised controlled trials suggested that first line beta blockers were not as good at decreasing mortality as other classes of antihypertensive drugs and were less well tolerated. 
cardiovascular system,458,What is an absolute contraindication to thrombolysis?,Heartburn,Intracerebral Haemorrhage,Family history of haemophilia,Head injury over one year ago,Previous history of TIAs,B,"There are numerous relative and absolute contraindications to thrombolysis. From the options the only absolute is intracerebral haemorrhage. Others include ischaemic stroke within 6 months, intracranial pathology, possible aortic dissection, uncontrolled hypertension and active bleeding."

Which coronary artery is most likely to be occluded?",Circumflex artery,Diagonal branch of the left anterior descending artery,Left anterior descending artery,Left coronary artery,Right coronary artery,E,"This patient has an inferior myocardial infarction, which is usually due to occlusion of the right coronary artery.   LITFL - MI localisation"
cardiovascular system,460,A 75-year-old female presented to the Emergency Department with a transient ischaemic attack. Her only past medical history is type II diabetes of 20-year duration. Her blood pressure was 140/90 mmHg and ECG showed atrial fibrillation. Which one of the following is the strongest risk factor for stroke?,Age ≥ 75,Atrial fibrillation (AF),Diabetes mellitus,Female sex,Hypercholesterolaemia,B,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common causative factor for thrombo-embolic stroke, increasing risk by four- to fivefold in all age groups.

cardiovascular system,461,"Whilst attending the cardiology clinic, the staff nurse measures the blood pressure of a 61-year-old man, and finds that it is 183/100 mmHg sitting and 190/105 mmHg standing. He has a heart rate of 81/minute, with an irregularly irregular rhythm. On auscultation of the heart, there are no murmurs, but he has bibasilar crackles on chest examination. Which of the following pathological findings is most likely to be present?",Cor pulmonale,Left atrial myxoma,Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH),Mitral regurgitation,Occlusive coronary atherosclerosis,C,"This gentleman is likely to have a hypertensive cardiomyopathy with a left ventricle hypertrophy. The LVH is secondary to increased afterload, as a result of chronic hypertension. The atrial fibrillation suggested by an irregularly irregular pulse, is an indicator of diastolic dysfunction and poor ventricular filling. This in turn indicates the pulmonary congestion, as evidenced by the bibasal crackles. There is no murmur or plop to suggest atrial myxoma."
cardiovascular system,462,A 17-year-old boy whose brother had hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was referred for a cardiological assessment. His echocardiogram confirmed the condition. Which one of the following echocardiographic features is the most important risk factor for sudden cardiac death?,A gradient of 10 mmHg across the left ventricular outflow tract,An enlarged left atrium,Significant thickening of the interventricular septum,Systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve,The presence of mitral regurgitation,C,"In hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, the cause of death is usually ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, the thicker the muscle the more abnormal the cardiac architecture and the higher the risk of arrhythmia and sudden death."

He has a temperature of 36.9°C, a pulse of 95/min, a blood pressure of 85/60 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 32/min. Investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 126 g/L (130-180)   Platelets 169 ×10^9/L (150-400)   White cell count 3.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)    Which of the following is the diagnosis?",Leaking aortic aneurysm,Multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS),Severe sepsis,Septic shock,Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS),E,"This patient has features of pancreatitis. He also has hypotension, and leucopenia. He therefore fulfils the criteria for systemic inflammatory response syndrome. This is equivalent to sepsis, but occurs in the absence of infection (e.g. in pancreatitis). SIRS is defined as two or more of the following:  Temperature more than 38°C or less than 36°C. Heart rate more than 90 beats/min. Respiratory rate more than 20 breaths/min or PaCO2 less than 4.3 kPa. WBC count 12,000/mm^3, less than 4000/mm^3 , or more than 10% immature (bands) form.  A leaking aortic aneurysm is still a possibility, however a decreased white cell count would not be expected. We do not have enough information to diagnose multi-organ dysfunction. There is no evidence of infection to make a diagnosis of septic shock or severe sepsis. For information, sepsis is defined as the association of systemic inflammatory responses with evidence of microbial origin. Severe sepsis also has hypoperfusion or dysfunction of at least one organ system, and septic shock is this plus hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation."
cardiovascular system,464,Which of the following is true regarding the blood supply of the heart?,The anterior cardiac vein drains into the coronary sinus,The atrioventricular node is supplied by the left coronary artery,The circumflex artery is a branch of the right coronary artery,The inferior part of the left ventricle is supplied by the left coronary artery,The left coronary artery originates from the left posterior aortic sinus,E,"The left coronary artery arises from the left posterior aortic cusp, and divides into the circumflex arteries and the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. The right coronary artery arises from the anterior aortic sinus, and supplies the right ventricle, part of the interventricular septum, the atrioventricular (A-V) node, and in 85% of cases the inferior part of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery provides a posterior interventricular branch and a marginal branch, which anastomoses with the LAD at the apex. The oblique vein (together with the small, middle and great cardiac veins) drains into the coronary sinus, which in turn drains into the right atrium. The anterior cardiac vein drains directly into the right atrium."
cardiovascular system,465,"A 52-year-old housewife presents to the hypertension clinic with hypertension that has proved difficult to control. Her general practitioner has started ramipril 1.25 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, bisoprolol 2.5 mg, and bendroflumethiazide 2.5 mg. Her systolic blood pressure is 152 mmHg, and it has consistently ranged 150-160 mmHg. The urine dipstick is normal. Renal function and electrolytes are normal. Her ECG showed borderline left axis deviation but is otherwise normal in rhythm and complexes, and a subsequent echocardiogram demonstrates good ejection fraction with no significant systolic or diastolic impairment. Which is the best treatment option for this patient?",Add spironolactone 2.5 mg,Add isosorbide mononitrate 25 mg BD,Increase bendroflumethiazide to 5 mg,Increase ramipril to 2.5 mg,Venesection,D,"The ramipril dose can be increased, as the renal function is normal and 1.25 mg is a modest dose. Repeat renal function is advised following any increase in ACE inhibition. Spironolactone is indicated in heart failure, at the higher dose of 25 mg. Other indications include portal hypertension-induced abdominal ascites, nephrotic syndrome and hyperaldosteronism syndrome. Renal function is normal, making the possibility of hyperaldosteronism (which features a hypokalaemic alkalosis) remote. Nitrates are indicated in angina, as an adjuvant in heart failure, but not solely for hypertension in view of tolerance to their antihypertensive action. The echocardiogram excludes systolic and diastolic heart failure, and thus the indication for spironolactone or nitrates. Bendroflumethiazide above the standard dose of 2.5 mg OD has no beneficial effects in blood pressure profile and runs an increased risk of side effects (exacerbating gout, diabetes, lupus, and renal impairment). Therapeutic venesection has no role in the management of chronic hypertension. Other antihypertensive options include adding another diuretic (metolazone or bumetanide or two potent loop diuretics), alpha blocker (doxazosin) or beta blockers. In this patient optimisation of drug therapy should be considered; polypharmacy risks an increase in adverse drug reactions and poor compliance. "
cardiovascular system,466,"A 17-year-old man from a traveller family presents to the Emergency Department for review, complaining of headaches, nose bleeds and pain in his calves on exercising. He tells you that he was taken to the paediatric clinic as a child because of a heart problem, but due to moving around the country he hasn't attended for many years. On examination his BP is 152/90mmHg in his right arm, it is 25mmHg lower in the left arm. His left arm appears slightly smaller than the right, and there is radiofemoral pulse delay. There is a systolic murmur and palpable thrill over the chest wall. Routine bloods are normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aortic stenosis,Coarctation of the aorta,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy,Patent ductus arteriosus,Pulmonary stenosis,B,"The answer is coarctation of the aorta. The classical signs pointing towards coarctation here include the differential blood pressures between the right and left arms, radiofemoral delay, systolic murmur, and thrill. Symptoms such as headache and nose bleeds occur due to hypertension proximal to the coarctation, and the pain in his calves is almost certainly due to poor distal blood supply. A chest radiograph is likely to demonstrate evidence of rib notching and may demonstrate an indentation of the aortic shadow at the site of the coarctation. In adults, balloon angioplasty and stenting is the preferred intervention. Aortic stenosis is more likely to present with symptoms of left ventricular failure and would be unusual in a patient of this age, and pulmonary stenosis classically presents with symptoms of right heart failure. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) usually presents with symptoms of outflow tract obstruction or syncope due to increased propensity for rhythm disturbance. A patent ductus arteriosus rarely presents for the first time in adulthood, and it is almost certainly only small lesions that present this late, usually with isolated rhythm disturbance."
cardiovascular system,467,A 40-year-old man attending a routine screening has a blood pressure of 166/100 mmHg. Two weeks later his blood pressure was 150/90 mmHg. He does not smoke. He drinks 35 units alcohol/week. His body mass index (BMI) is 31.5 kg/m^2 (20-25). What is the best management strategy?,Amlodipine,Atenolol,Bendroflumethiazide,Enalapril,Lifestyle advice,E,"This 40-year-old man has grade 1 obesity as evidenced by his body mass index:    Grade 1 30-34.9 kg/m^2   Grade 2 35-39.9 kg/m^2   Grade 3 greater than40 kg/m^2    Hypertension in this individual is most likely due to obesity-related hypertension or due to pseudo-Cushing's syndrome in view of his high alcohol intake and increased BMI. The following contribute to obesity-related hypertension:  Heightened sympathetic nervous system activity Hyperinsulinaemia, insulin resistance, and Hyperleptinaemia  He needs lifestyle advice about reducing his alcohol intake and compatible dietary advice to reduce his weight.

cardiovascular system,468,A 45 year old female presented to her GP with a few weeks history of headache. She was found to have a blood pressure of 215/110.  She states she is otherwise feeling well with no associated features and is generally in good health and is on no regular medications. There is no worrying features regarding her headache. She is a smoker and is overweight. There is no family history of any renal disease. On examination she has a BMI of 35 although there was no evidence of striae. Her heart rate was 92 bpm and heart sounds normal.,Essential Hypertension,Malignant hypertension,Glomerulonephritis,Phaeochromocytoma,Cushing's syndrome,A,"The most likely diagnosis is Essential hypertension. There is no features to suggest Cushing's syndrome, Phaeochromocytoma or renal disease. Malignant hypertension is defined as systolic >200 mm Hg or diastolic >130 mm Hg associated with encephalopathy, nephropathy or papilloedema and/or angiopathic haemolytic anaemia."
cardiovascular system,469,A 78-year-old man has suddenly lost the use of his left arm. Within 24 hours he has made a full recovery. ECG and echocardiography are normal. A subsequent carotid duplex USS shows an occlusion of the right internal carotid artery and 72% stenosis of the left internal carotid artery. Which treatment should be considered?,Left carotid bypass,Left carotid endarterectomy,Right and left endarterectomy,Right carotid angioplasty,Right carotid endarterectomy,B,This man has had a transient ischaemic attack affecting the right side of the brain. The right internal carotid is completely occluded and therefore any intervention should not be considered on this side. The role of endarterectomy for asymptomatic carotid disease (as in the case on the left side) is topical with evidence that it reduces the risk of future stroke.
cardiovascular system,470,Which of the following findings is the most specific for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction?,An akinetic area of LV wall motion on ECHO,Elevated cardiac enzymes,Evolution of Q waves on ECG,History of severe chest pain,ST elevation on ECG,C,"Cardiac enzymes may be elevated in pulmonary embolism (PE), renal failure, and sepsis. It is increasingly recognised that raised troponin is not specific to myocardial ischaemia, and therefore must be interpreted in the context of the clinical history. Raised ST segments can be associated with conditions such as pericarditis, and is again not specific for myocardial ischaemia. It can also be related to ethncicity or age as well as other conditions such as aoritc disection. As any medical doctor on call knows, severe chest pain has a vast number of differential diagnoses. Akinetic wall motion on the echo may occur with any regional disease process like amyloid, etc. The evolution of Q waves is the most suggestive of an infarct. A Q wave is any negative deflection that precedes an R wave on the ECG. Small Q waves are normal in most leads, and they can be prominent in leads III and aVR as a normal variant, but should not be seen in leads V1-V3. They are considered pathological if they are more than 1 mm wide, more than 2 mm deep, more than 25% of the depth of the QRS complex, or seen in leads V1-V3.

cardiovascular system,471,Which one of the following statements is true about the Austin Flint murmur?,It can be distinguished from the murmur of mitral stenosis by absence of presystolic accentuation,It does not occur in aortic incompetence secondary to an aortitis,It is an early sign of aortic regurgitation,It is associated with a loud first heart sound,It is a low frequency mid/late diastolic murmur,E,"The Austin Flint murmur is a low frequency mid/late diastolic murmur which may show pre-systolic accentuation and is virtually indistinguishable from that of mitral stenosis. It is due to partial closure of the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve by the regurgitant jet. There is no correlation between the presence of murmur and severity of AR, or aetiology. The first heart sound is normal but in severe cases it may be absent."

His plasma lactate concentration is 2.9 mmol/L (less than1.5). Which of the following is an appropriate method of measuring adequate intravascular filling?",LiDCO (lithium dilution cardiac output),Oesophageal Doppler monitoring,PiCCO (pulse contour cardiac output),Pulmonary artery flotation catheter (PAFC),Transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE),C,"PiCCO gives indications of cardiac output, extravascular lung water, intravascular filling and only requires a central line and a PiCCO femoral arterial line and as such is relatively simple to use. It would also not be unreasonable to insert an oesophageal Doppler device; however they have greater interobserver variation and require a degree of experience to use and are prone to misplacement. LiDCO is still not validated or practical to be widely used. PAFC are used widely in the USA however a study has questioned their safety and they have fallen out of favour in the UK. TOE requires considerable expertise to use and is not suitable for cardiac output studies."

On examination his pulse is 90 regular, BP 140/90 mmHg, heart sounds normal, and his chest auscultation did not reveal any abnormalities. He is currently taking lisinopril 30 mg OD and furosemide 80 mg OD. What is the best treatment option?",Amiodarone,Carvedilol,Digoxin,Spironolactone,Valsartan,B,"Beta-blockers improve mortality and quality of life in chronic heart failure (COPERNICUS, MERIT, CIBIS trials). They should be initiated once patients are stable, and can be used in all classes of heart failure, though they can cause an acute deterioration in patients who have very severe symptoms. They should be avoided in the acute setting. Spironolactone improves outcome and symptoms in severe (class 3-4) chronic heart failure (RALES). Valsartan does not affect outcome as add on treatment (VALHEFT). Digoxin may reduce hospitalisation and improves QOL but has a neutral benefit to mortality (DIG study). Amiodarone in the absence of arrhythmias does not affect outcome."
cardiovascular system,476,A 68-year-old man has been very ill for months following the onset of chronic liver disease with hepatitis C infection. He experiences a sudden loss of consciousness and then exhibits hemiplegia on the right. A cerebral angiogram reveals lack of perfusion in the left middle cerebral artery distribution. Which of the following is the most likely cardiac lesion to be associated with this finding?,Acute rheumatic fever,Left atrial myxoma,Libman-Sacks endocarditis,Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis,Paradoxical thromboembolus,D,Non-bacterial thrombotic endocarditis (marantic endocarditis) is due to platelet-fibrin thrombi that are prone to embolising. This form of non-infective endocarditis can be seen in persons who are very debilitated or who have a hypercoagulable state. The deposition of fibrin on valve leaflets causes sterile vegetations that can embolise.

Rheumatic AS results from fibrosis of the leaflets and fusion of the commissures. An ejection click or ejection sound, best heard at the apex, implies that the site of the stenosis is mostly valvular and of congenital origin, that is, bicuspid valvular disease. The other options are non-specific or not suggestive of a congenital bicuspid valve."

cardiovascular system,482,"A 76-year-old man suddenly collapsed and died. At post mortem exam, a retroperitoneal hematoma due to ruptured aortic aneurysm was noted. What is the most likely underlying cause of the aortic aneurysm?",Atheroma,Cystic medial necrosis,Dissecting aneurysm,Polyarteritis nodosa,Syphilis,A,"Any condition that causes the walls of the arteries to weaken can lead to an aneurysm. Atherosclerosis is the leading cause. Others are high blood pressure, and smoking. Deep wounds, injuries, or infections can also cause blood vessels to bulge"
cardiovascular system,483,"A 57-year-old man develops deep venous thrombosis during a hospitalisation for prostatectomy. He exhibits decreased mental status with right hemiplegia, and a CT scan of the head suggests an acute cerebral infarction in the distribution of the left middle cerebral artery. A chest x ray reveals cardiac enlargement and prominence of the main pulmonary arteries that suggests pulmonary hypertension. His serum troponin I is less than0.4 ng/ml. Which of the following lesions is most likely to be present on echocardiography?",Coarctation of the aorta,Dextrocardia,Pulmonary stenosis,Tetralogy of Fallot,Ventricular septal defect,E,"This is 'paradoxical embolus' from right to left. This can only happen if there is a defect that allows passage from right to left. This can happen across a patent foramen ovale. In this case, the pulmonary hypertension suggests that there may have been a shunt persistent for a long time - Eisenmenger complex. An atrial or a ventricular septal defect can provide the shunt. Tetralogy of fallot and pulmonary stenosis do not cause pulmonary hypertension. A coarct does not cause cardiomegaly."
cardiovascular system,484,A 40-year-old female with mitral stenosis consults for advice regarding operative procedures. In which of the following circumstances would antibiotic prophylaxis of infective endocarditis be required?,Caesarian section,Cardiac catheterisation,Dental scaling,Termination of pregnancy,None of the above,E,"According to NICE guidelines, antibiotic Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (CG64) is not recommended in common cardiac valve abnormalities.

A biopsy of this lesion is obtained, and histologic examination reveals a muscular artery with lumenal narrowing and medial inflammation with lymphocytes, macrophages, and occasional giant cells. He improves with a course of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. Which of the following laboratory test findings is most likely to be present with this disease?",Anti-double stranded DNA titre of 1:1024,Erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 50 mm/hr,HDL cholesterol of 0.6 mmol/L,pANCA titre of 1:160,Rheumatoid factor titre of 80 IU/mL,B,"These are classic findings for temporal arteritis, the most typical involvement with giant cell arteritis. Corticosteroid therapy typically produces a reduction of symptoms. Not treating this condition puts the patient at risk for involvement of other branches of the external carotid artery, the worst of which would be the ophthalmic branch. Temporal arteritis causes blindness secondary to an ischaemic optic neuropathy, central retinal arteryocclusion, orcortical infarction. Although there may be some improvement in vision after treatment of ischaemic optic neuropathy, established blindness is irreversible. British Journal of Ophthalmology, 1991,75,432"

A more complete biochemical profile would demonstrate alkalosis. The hypokalaemia is often refractory to supplements. As the name suggests, aldosterone levels are high and this suppresses renin levels. Liddle's syndrome, a rare genetic abnormality of Na^+channels, has a similar clinical presentation of fatigue, hypertension and hypokalaemia, although the sodium is usually higher. Aldosterone levels are high in Conn's syndrome and low-normal in Liddle's syndrome, and were likely checked prior to imaging. CT or MRI of the abdomen readily identifies a secretory adrenal adenoma, which is not readily evident on abdominal x ray, subsequently managed by adrenalectomy. CT brain may be indicated in hypokalaemia, with and without hyponatraemia (which may have been corrected too rapidly), to look for central pontine myelinolysis in the very different setting of alcoholic Korsakoff's syndrome with vitamin and electrolyte deficiencies.

cardiovascular system,487,A 35 year old with asthma and systemic sclerosis is found to have malignant hypertension with a BP of 220/130mmHg and evidence of retinal haemorrhages and pulmonary oedema on examination.  How do you manage this patient immediately?,Nifedipine,IV Sodium Nitroprusside,Atenolol,IV Labetalol,Ramipril,A,Nifedipine (orally) is the most appropriate as blood pressure in malignant hypertension should be lowered gradually.  Atenolol is not indicated in this case due to the history of asthma.  Aims are lowering diastolic to 100 105mmHg over a few days.  Blood pressure should be monitored 4 hourly and should not drop initially more than 25 per cent of presenting.  First line therapy are beta blockers or calcium antagonist such as nifedipine (sublingual should be avoided as it can lead to dramatic falls).
cardiovascular system,488,A 65-year-old man was advised to start oral digoxin at a dose of 250 µg daily. His physician explained that the full effect of this treatment would not be apparent for at least a week. Which one of the following pharmacokinetic variables did the physician use to give this explanation?,Bioavailability,Half life,Plasma protein binding,Renal clearance,Volume of distribution,B,Digoxin follows first order kinetics and has a half life of 1.6 days in a patient with normal renal function. Sixty five per cent of the drug absorbed remains in the system after one day. Subsequent doses gradually accumulate until a steady state is achieved after four to five days. Bioavailability is the amount of drug absorbed into the blood stream from ingestion of the drug. Plasma protein binding is the degree of binding of the drug in the blood stream to proteins.  Renal clearance is the rate at which the drug is cleared through the kidneys. Volume of distribution is the apparent volume into which the drug is distributed to equate to the same concentration in the blood stream.

An ECHO reveals no structural abnormality. You want to exclude a myocardial infarct. What investigation should be performed in the first instance?,Exercise tolerance test,Thallium perfusion scan,Coronary angiography,Repeat ECG,CT angiography,A,An ETT should be performed in the first instance to investigate if there is any evidence of ischaemia. This should be performed before any more invasive tests such as angiography. A thallium perfusion scan can be utilised if the patient cannot manage an ETT.

Exercise related syncopes are of 2 types, i) Syncope during exercise or exertional syncope (this is ominous) and ii) Post exercise syncope (this is benign). Few examples of Syncope during exercise- arrhythmia, valvular heart disease, structural heart disease like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, coronary artery disease, myocarditis etc. Example of Syncope following exercise- orthostatic hypotension as in case of exercise in hot environment with vasodilation and increased sweating, prolonged standing, vasovagal related to sudden decrease in venous return etc. Given cause is exertional syncope and systolic murmur indicates valvular lesion (particularly aortic stenosis) in this elderly man"
cardiovascular system,491,A 28-year-old man presents with rapid pounding in the chest. He is completely conscious throughout. The ECG was taken (SVT). What is the 1st medicine to be used to manage this condition?,Amiodarone,Adenosine,Lidocaine,Verapamil,Metoprolol,B,"Management of SVT: i) vagal manoeuvres (carotid sinus message, Valsalva manoeuvre) transiently increase AV-block, and unmask the underlying atrial rhythm. If unsuccessful then the first medicine used in SVT is adenosine, which causes transient AV block and works by i) transiently slowing ventricles to show the underlying atrial rhythm ii) cardioverting a junctional tachycardia to sinus rhythm"
cardiovascular system,492,"A 62-year-old male who is being treated for stable angina presents with muscle aches and pains. He has been taking simvastatin 40 mg daily, atenolol 50 mg daily together with aspirin 75 mg daily for approximately two years. Recently he was admitted for an episode of acute coronary syndrome and a number of other therapies were added. You suspect a statin-related myopathy and a CPK concentration is 820 IU/L (50-200). Which of the following is most likely to be responsible for the precipitation of his statin-related myopathy?",Bisoprolol,Clopidogrel,Diltiazem,Omega-3 fatty acids,Spironolactone,C,"Statin-associated myopathy occurs in up to 5% of those treated with statins and may be exacerbated by the co-prescription of other drugs such as calcium channel blockers, macrolide antibiotics, fibrates, amiodarone and grapefruit juice. Whilst patients may tolerate a statin extremely well, a myopathy or rhabdomyolysis can quite easily be precipitated by the addition of these agents. NICE guidance on Myocardial infarction: secondary prevention (NG185) advises that you should not offer or advise people to use omega-3 capsules to prevent another MI."

What ECG finding is likely to be seen?",Right Bundle Branch Block,Prolonged PR Interval,Prolonged QT interval,Left Bundle Branch Block,Bifid P waves,D,When the pulmonary valve closes before the aortic valve this leads to reversed splitting of the second heart sound. This can be seen in left bundle branch block when the aortic valve closure is delayed due to failed conduction. This can also be observed in aortic stenosis where there is delayed closure of the valve due to a structural abnormality.

His ECG shows sinus tachycardia only and his cardiac enzymes, when they return the next day, are normal. His symptoms resolved quickly with oxygen and furosemide. Which of the following conditions is the most likely explanation of this presentation?",Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM),Myocardial infarction,Phaeochromocytoma,Pulmonary embolism (PE),Renal artery stenosis,E,"Flash pulmonary oedema in someone with a history of hypertension, especially those suspected of being arteriopaths such as smokers, should raise the possibility of renal artery stenosis. Given his cardiac enzymes and normal ECG an MI is not likley, nor is HOCM and the case presentaiton does not fit.  A Phaeochromocytoma is a possible explanation for the hypertension but given his age and smoking history this is not likley causing it.

cardiovascular system,497,"A 65-year-old man with a history of myocardial infarction four years earlier was admitted with progressive shortness of breath and decreasing exercise tolerance. He has smoked 40 cigarettes per day for the last 45 years. He takes lansoprazole, aspirin and lisinopril. Which of the following laboratory tests would help identify the reason for his symptoms?",Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP),Clotting screen,C reactive protein,Full blood count,Urea and electrolytes,A,"This patient has features of heart failure which appear to be related to underlying ischaemic heart disease. The differential diagnosis is COPD, given his extensive smoking history. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterised by dyspnoea, fatigue and ankle oedema. Signs which can point towards the diagnosis are pulmonary rales, pleural effusion, raised jugular venous pressure and peripheral oedema. Objective evidence is gained from echocardiogram, and raised natriuretic peptide concentration. Cardiomegaly, third heart sound and murmurs can be suggestive of cardiac failure. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines state there must be symptoms, signs AND objective evidence before a diagnosis of heart failure can be made. It is important to always attempt to identify the underlying cause. BNP is a biologically active peptide, which has vasodilator and natriuretic properties. It is synthesised in the cardiac ventricles and correlates with left ventricle (LV) pressure, degree of dyspnoea, and state of neurohormonal modulation. Levels increase markedly in left ventricular dysfunction, and the level correlates with symptom severity (and decrease after effective treatment). It is raised in right or left systolic or diastolic heart failure. As such, it is an important clinical marker for the diagnosis of heart failure in patients with dyspnoea that could be attributed to a number of causes. Its use as a prognostic marker, therapy guide or screening marker is under investigation. One note of caution, however, as levels can be raised in comorbid illness, age, renal failure and obesity and therefore correlation should be made with the clinical scenario. In practice, as this patient has had a previous MI, according to the current NICE guidelines he needs specialist assessment and Doppler echocardiography within two weeks. However, as this is not an option, BNP is the best available answer. BNP is used first line in patients who have not had a previous MI. Levels greater than400 pg/ml warrant urgent specialist assessment and echocardiography; intermediate levels (100-400 pg/ml) should be investigated within six weeks. FBC, Uandamp;E and creatinine, CRP and clotting screen are non-specific investigations which are unlikely to directly lead to a diagnosis in this case. "

What is the single most appropriate diagnosis?,Angina,Costochondritis (tietz’s disease),Dissecting aneurysm,MI,Pulmonary embolism,D,The features described is insufficient and can be seen in both aortic dissection and MI. However dissection pain is described as tearing and crushing pain is often used for MI pain. Both dissection and MI can have pain radiation to neck. History of diabetes goes with mi as it is a recognized risk factor for MI. Some may argue in DM MI will be painless! But it is not always the case. MI is only painless when autonomic neuropathy becomes well established
cardiovascular system,502,A 56-year-old man diagnosed with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) secondary to pancreatitis is admitted to the High Dependency Unit. He has a pulse of 109 beats/min and a blood pressure of 89/74 mmHg despite receiving IV fluids and urine output of 25 ml/hour after catheterisation. Which of the following is the most appropriate course of action for this patient?,A central line,A CT abdomen,A surgical referral,An arterial line,Broad spectrum antibiotics,A,"Early goal-directed therapy (EGDT) in cases of SIRS or septic shock is becoming increasingly recognised as potentially beneficial. If fluids are not achieving haemodynamic stability, and there is indication of hypoperfusion as indicated by oliguria or lactataemia, then vigorous resuscitation is indicated. EGDT aims to increase organ perfusion through restoration of mean arterial pressure using inotropes if necessary, maintaining central venous pressure (CVP), maintaining oxygenation, and using SjVO2 (jugular venous oxygen saturation) as a guide to oxygen utilisation at the tissue level. SjVO2 higher than 70% is indicative of organ hypoperfusion, as oxygen is not being extracted. Insertion of a central line above allows measurement of CVP, SjVO2 and the use of inotropes."
cardiovascular system,503,"A 14-year-old boy is admitted to the Emergency Department, hypotensive after an injury sustained whilst playing rugby. The boy was tackled from the side and experienced severe pain over the left lower rib cage. On examination his pulse is 140 bpm and blood pressure 80/40 mmHg. There was bruising over the left flank and tenderness on palpation. What is the likely diagnosis?",Aortic dissection,Liver trauma,Musculoskeletal injury only,Renal haematoma,Splenic rupture,E,"High impact injuries to the left flank may cause damage the spleen or kidney as well as the ribs and soft tissue. If there are fractured ribs and the patient is hypotensive suspect rupture of the spleen. If the patient responds to fluid resuscitation, a CT scan be arranged to confirm the diagnosis. The injury can be graded and together with physical parameters a decision can be made to conservatively manage or operate. Observation should be undertaken in an High Dedpendency Unit (HDU) setting initially so that any deterioration in haemodynamic parameters may be acted upon. CT is also useful in trauma to exclude other injuries, such as hollow visceral injuries that would mandate a laparotomy. Renal trauma rarely renders the patient hypotensive unless other organs are also injured, and more force would be required for aortic dissection."
cardiovascular system,504,"A 54-year-old man presents with central crushing chest pain. Examination is normal. 12-lead ECG shows ST segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF and ST depression in V1, V2 and V3. Which coronary artery is occluded?",Circumflex,Left anterior descending,Left main stem,Obtuse marginal,Right coronary artery,E,"The ECG describes an infero-posterior myocardial infarction (MI). This territory is supplied by a dominant right coronary artery. The concept of coronary dominance refers to which coronary artery supplies the posterior descending coronary artery. In the case of approximately 85% of patients this is the right coronary artery with about 15% of patients having a dominant left circumflex. The territories supplied by the arteries are as follows:  Circumflex: lateral Left anterior descending: anterior and septum Left main stem: branches into the left anterior descending artery and circumflex and supplies most of the left ventricle. Complete left main stem occlusion is invariably fatal. Obtuse marginal: one of the branches of the circumflex and supplies the 'high lateral' region of the left ventricle (ECG leads I and aVL).  Basic understanding of coronary anatomy is important as this is predictive of problems following MI. For example, the right coronary artery supplies the AV node, so heart block following inferior MI is common. However, heart block following anterior MI is a grave prognostic marker as this indicates a large anterior wall infarct. The right coronary system also supplies the right ventricle, hence problems relating to a right ventricular infarct are commonly associated with an inferior MI. "

Which of the following hypoglycaemic agents is contraindicated in this patient?",Acarbose,Glipizide,Metformin,Nateglinide,Pioglitazone,E,"Pioglitazone can result in fluid retention of unknown aetiology which may cause a mild dilutional anaemia (haemoglobin typically falls by 10 to 20 g/L) and ankle oedema. It is contraindicated in congestive heart failure. Sulphonylureas, acarbose, and nateglinide can be used in patients with heart failure. To reduce the risk of lactic acidosis, metformin should be avoided in those at risk of tissue hypoxia or sudden deterioration in renal function, such as those with dehydration, severe infection, shock, sepsis, acute heart failure, respiratory failure, or hepatic impairment, or those who have recently had a myocardial infarction. Although acute heart failure may increase the risk of lactic acidosis with metformin, this patient's heart failure appears to be controlled, and metformin may be used with caution."
cardiovascular system,507,A 40-year-old male attends for a consultation after discovering that his brother has been diagnosed with a familial hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). Which first line screening method should he be offered?,Coronary angiograms,Exercise ECG,Genetic testing,Transoesophageal echocardiogram,Transthoracic echocardiogram,E,Current guidelines suggest that a resting ECG and TTE (transthoracic ECHO) are the most effective screening strategies for relatives of patients with HOCM. Genetic testing is not recommended as a first line screening tool given varying rates of penetrance.  
cardiovascular system,508,A 43-year-old man presents to the Emergency Department with a three hour history of chest pain. He has a history of 'angina' diagnosed by his GP. He is awaiting objective assessment to confirm this. His GP started aspirin and gave him a GTN spray with instructions how to use it. The pain came on after walking up a hill but has not gone away. He took three puffs of GTN but this had no significant effect. He looks sweaty and unwell. You review his 12 lead ECG but it looks normal to you. You think this patient has an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and decide to admit for assessment. Which of the features listed below is a good indicator of presence of acute coronary syndrome?,Associated feeling of impending doom,Associated nausea and sweating,Good response to GTN,Pain in chest lasting at least one hour,Pain which varies with patient's position,B,Diagnosis of ACS is based on clinical history and/or presence of ischaemic ECG changes with or without troponin elevation. Each of these should not be relied upon in isolation but interpreted in the context of the others. NICE have produced guidance on Chest pain of recent onset (CG95). It lists clinical factors which are good indicators of ACS. These include typical pain lasting at least 15 minutes and associated nausea and sweating. The guidance specifically mentions that response to GTN should not be used as GTN has a strong placebo.
cardiovascular system,509,A previously well 60-year-old lady is admitted with an acute anterior myocardial infarction. A random blood glucose concentration was found to be 12.1 mmol/L (less than6.7). Which is the optimal management method of her blood sugar?,Commence gliclazide,Commence intravenous insulin,Commence metformin,Commence subcutaneous insulin,No therapy other than continued dietary control,B,"The DIGAMI study has demonstrated that there is a survival advantage in initially treating such patients with elevated glucose concentrations with sliding scale insulin for 24 hours post-infarct, even if they are not known to be diabetic. It also suggested there was a better prognosis if patients had treatment with subcutaneous insulin for three months following a myocardial infarct.^1 However, DIGAMI 2 contested these results suggesting no survival benefits between insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs). However, in the acute setting, insulin sliding scale is thought to be the optimum treatment. "

cardiovascular system,511,A 60-year-old diabetic complains of pain in thigh and gluteal region on walking up the stairs for the last 6 months. She is a heavy smoker and has ischemic heart disease. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?,Thromboangitis Obliterans,Sciatica,DVT,Atherosclerosis,Embolus,D,"Atherosclerotic narrowing of vessels are producing these symptoms. Why atherosclerosis? There is other vasculopathy as IHD. Smoking is a risk factor for atherosclerosis. Now if we think of exclusion: i) It is not sciatica as sciatica pain is worse when sitting. There may be weakness, numbness, difficulty moving the leg or foot. A constant pain on one side of the rear. A shooting pain that makes it difficult to stand up. ii) It is not DVT as no swelling, warmth or redness of skin are there iii) It is not thromboangitis obliterans as pulses are ok, no colour change or reduced hair growth, no ulceration or gangrene iv) not embolism as no pain (rest pain), no numbness, not pale or blue, no rash, no ulceration of skin"
cardiovascular system,512,A 58-year-old man suddenly becomes shocked several days after suffering an acute myocardial infarction. His chest X-ray shows a large globular shaped heart and clear lung fields. What is the single most likely diagnosis.,Acute pericarditis,Atrial thrombus,Cardiac tamponade,Heart block,Left ventricular aneurism,C,Large globular heart indicates cardiac tamponade. Shock is due to compromised cardiac output due to tamponade
cardiovascular system,513,"A 33-year-old male came to the hospital with complaint of occasional left sided chest pain that lasts <30 minutes, following exercise, which relieves upon taking rest. What is the most probable diagnosis?",Unstable angina,Decubitus angina,Stable angina,Coronary spasm,MI,C,"Stable angina is chest pain or discomfort that most often occurs with activity or emotional stress and lasts for <30 minutes, relieved by rest or nitroglycerine. Symptoms of angina occur when blood supply to heart muscle is reduced. This happens when the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis or by a blood clot"
cardiovascular system,514,A 55-year-old man presents with severe dyspnoea with tachycardia. Clinical examination raises the possibility that pericardial disease may be the cause. Which of the following clinical features best distinguishes cardiac tamponade from constrictive pericarditis?,Hypotension,Kussmaul's sign,Muffled heart sounds,Pulsus paradoxus,Raised JVP,A,"Cardiac tamponade is characterised by Beck's triad of:  hypotension raised JVP, and muffled heart sounds.  Constrictive pericarditis tends to present with features of right-sided cardiac failure with hypotension as a late feature. In cardiac tamponade there is pulsus paradoxus (a greater than 10 mmHg fall in systolic BP on inspiration) but this is less commonly seen in constrictive pericarditis, though can still be present in both. Kussmaul's sign (a rise in the JVP on inspiration) is more likely to be seen in constrictive pericarditis than cardiac tamponade. Muffled heart sounds is neither distinctive nor helps to discriminate. It is non-specific and subjective so should not be relied upon in clinical practice."
cardiovascular system,515,A 60-year-old man had a myocardial infarction (MI) six weeks ago. He is taking aspirin 75 mg/day and metoprolol 50 mg 2/day. During a routine follow up exercise test he has a 20 beat run of non-sustained VT. He achieved stage 4 of the Bruce protocol and 92% of his target heart rate. The non-sustained VT occurred halfway through stage 2. ST segments were normal during the study. Which of the following is the definitive investigation?,24 hour Holter monitor,Coronary angiography,Echocardiogram,Electrophysiological study (EPS),Thallium exercise scan,D,"Post MI ventricular tachycardia (VT) is most commonly due to scar tissue. It may also be related to ischaemia, but no signs of ischaemia were induced. The definitive investigation would be EPS due to the fact that if this were scar related VT, the site could be localised and even possibly ablated. If not, then an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implantation may be warranted on Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation Trial (MADIT)^1 criteria, if left ventricular (LV) dysfunction exists. Angiography plus thallium may inform us of significant coronary artery disease (CAD) but not offer us a solution to the problem. An echocardiogram would not be of much use apart from assessing LV function, although in this patient one might assume that LV function is pretty good achieving stage 4 of Bruce protocol, thus an echocardiogram, although required, would not be the definitive test and would be lower on the selection list. There is no need for Holter as the VT has already been recorded. The MADIT trial was stopped early in 1996 by the steering committee due to extremely positive results in the ICD group. As a consequence it was only published in abstract form. However, MADIT-2 showed a 5.6% 20 month absolute survival benefit in patients with LV dysfunction (EFless than30%), post MI, treated prophylactically with an ICD^2. "
cardiovascular system,516,"A 74-year-old man with ischaemic heart disease is in the surgical high dependency unit following a Hartmann's procedure completed 12 hours previously. He is in pain. He has drained 100/200/300 mls of blood into his drains in each of the last three hours. His blood pressure is 110/80 mmHg, his pulse 105/min. He has a respiratory rate 32/min, SpO2 100% on oxygen by face mask. Crossmatched blood is available.    Haemoglobin 81 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 4.5 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 132 ×10^9/L (150-400)    Which of the following actions would be undertake as your initial priority?",Give 1000 ml of colloid stat,Give 1000 ml of crystalloid stat,Morphine 5 mg intravenously,Return to theatre,Transfuse 2 units of packed red blood cells stat,E,"He is still actively bleeding and haemodilution will not have been achieved so his Hb will be lower than the result given. It will take at least 30-60 minutes before he is back in theatre and anaesthetized (CEPOD lists/emergency sections/crash calls/no porter etc). With IHD he is at at high risk of a perioperative MI. He should have the blood first as crossmatched blood is available. His observations could be caused by pain. However in the face of a falling haemoglobin, a rising pulse rate and an increasing loss into his drains this patient needs to return to theatre. His blood pressure is not critically low and although many would give crystalloid or colloid it is reasonable in an elderly man with ischaemic heart disease to give blood if it is easily available. Overload with non-oxygen carrying fluid should be avoided (although the red cells are not functional for a while)."
cardiovascular system,517,"A 65-year-old male attends clinic complaining of breathlessness. He has end stage cardiac failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy. Currently he takes furosemide, lisinopril, and carvedilol. Which one of the following drugs should be added to his current therapy?",Diltiazem ,Isosorbide mononitrate,Nicorandil ,Spironolactone,Vitamin C ,D,Spironolactone (aldosterone receptor antagonist) is the optimal add on medication for advanced heart failure symptoms. The others have not been shown to improve outcomes in cardiac failure.
cardiovascular system,518,"An 80-year-old man with prostatic cancer has confusion, thirst, abdominal pain and an abnormal ECG. What is the most appropriate investigation?",MRI spine,Radionuclide bone scan,DEXA scan,Serum ALP concentration,Serum calcium concentration,E,"Confusion, thirst, abdominal pain and ECG changes (marked shortening of QT interval) are features of hypercalcemia. So E. Serum calcium concentration is the likely option"
cardiovascular system,519,Which of the following is true of cardiac disorders in surgical patients?,60% of patients will re-infarct if operated on within three months of a myocardial infarction,Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) is a myocardial specific isoenzyme,Heart failure is classified by the NYHA classification system,Peri-operative myocardial infarction has a mortality of approximately 10%,Risk of peri-operative heart failure is approximately 70% if there is a pre-operative cardiovascular history,C,"Creatine kinase is an MB isoenzyme that peaks at 24-48 hours following myocardial infarction but currently troponins are used as the specific markers of myocardial injury. Of those that have already had a myocardial infarct 30% will reinfarct if operated within three months. The mortality for peri-operative myocardial infarction is approximately 40%. Therefore elective surgery is undertaken after six months and urgent surgery at four to six weeks with invasive monitoring and a preoperative stress test. The greatest risk is to those undergoing thoracic, abdominal or vascular surgery (5-15% aortic surgery). Myocardial infarction, and more commonly, fluid overload may precipitate heart failure in the surgical patient. The risk of peri-operative heart failure is approximately 17% if there is a pre-operative cardiovascular history. Heart failure may be classified into four groups according to the NYHA classification system, to allow prediction of operative mortality:    Class Description Mortality   1 No functional limitation 4%   2 Dyspnoea on exercise 11%   3 Dyspnoea with normal activity 27%   4 Dyspnoea at rest 67%"

Tirofiban blocks glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptors.
cardiovascular system,521,A 20-year-old male presents for lower limb contracture release. He is known to have muscular dystrophy. Which one of the following statements is correct?,A pre-operative 12 lead ECG is required,Hypokalaemia and myoglobinuria may occur post-operatively,Plasma creatinine kinase concentrations will be low,Post-operative chest infections are uncommon,These patients quickly develop tolerance to opioid analgesics,A,"Muscular dystrophies are rare hereditary disorders of muscle. Progressive destruction of skeletal and cardiac muscle occurs by a mechanism thought to involve abnormal muscle membrane function. Plasma creatine kinase level may be increased. Patients tend to present with limb contractures. They have weak respiratory muscles which impairs ventilation and sputum clearance. Pre-existing and postoperative chest infections are common and they are especially sensitive to opioids and other respiratory depressant drugs. Severe hyperkalaemia and myoglobinuria may occur following prolonged exposure to volatile anaesthetic agents, therefore regional techniques are preferred. As arrhythmias and cardiac failure may occur due to myocardial involvement, an ECG and echocardiogram will provide valuable preoperative information on cardiac function."
cardiovascular system,522,"A 55-year-old man returns for routine follow up 6 weeks after an MI. He gets breathless when walking uphill. His ECG shows ST elevation in leads V1, V2, V3 and V4. What is the single most likely explanation for the abnormal investigation?",Heart block,Right ventricular strain,Atrial thrombus,Left ventricular aneurysm,Dressler’s syndrome,D,"Left ventricular aneurysm is defined as a localized area of myocardium with abnormal outward bulging and deformation during systole and diastole. Clinically, ventricular aneurysms may be recognized late with features of heart failure and persistent ST elevation, recurrent ventricular arrhythmias, or recurrent embolization. Risk factors for these aneurysms after acute MI include the following: Female sex, Total occlusion of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery, Single-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD), Absence of previous angina pectoris"

cardiovascular system,524,Which of the following drugs is least likely to lead to digoxin toxicity?,Erythromycin,Atenolol,Quinidine,Amiodarone,Amlodipine,E,"Although diltiazem and verapamil have been shown to increase serum digoxin levels, amlodipine has not been directly linked. All the other drugs have been associated with increased digoxin levels for example amiodarone is thought to reduce renal clearance of digoxin and have additive effects on the heart rate."
cardiovascular system,525,An 18-year-old man complains of fatigue and dyspnea. He has left parasternal heave and systolic thrill with a harsh pan-systolic murmur at left parasternal edge. What is the most probable diagnosis?,TOF (tetralogy of fallot),ASD (atrial septal defect),VSD (ventricular septal defect),PDA (patent ductus arteriosus),TGA (transposition of great arteries),C,"A small ventricular septal defect may cause no problems, and many small VSDs close on their own. Medium or larger VSDs may need surgical repair early in life to prevent complications. If not treated may cause symptoms like shortness of breath, a feeling of tiredness or weakness (especially during exercise), poor appetite, and trouble gaining weight.left parasternal heave and systolic thrill with a harsh pan-systolic murmur at left parasternal edge are examination findings of moderate to severe ventricular septal defect"
cardiovascular system,526,A 68-year-old man is found to have an infra-renal abdominal aortic aneurysm on an ultrasound scan for bladder outflow obstruction. Which diameter of aneurysm is an indication for intervention in an asymptomatic patient?,4.0 cm,4.5 cm,5.0 cm,5.5 cm,6.0 cm,D,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm may cause symptoms due to pressure on surrounding structures, although the majority are asymptomatic at diagnosis. Abdominal aortic aneurysms primarily affect men over 65 years, with a prevalence of 5%. Approximately 70% of presenting abdominal aortic aneurysms are detected before rupturing, and are treated electively with 30% presenting as a rupture or with distal embolisation. Evidence supports surgical intervention when an abdominal aortic aneurysm is =5.5 cm in maximal diameter, although this is subject to the patient's health and fitness for surgery. Surgical intervention may be indicated if the patient develops acute onset of pain in the aneurysm, as this may represent imminent rupture of the aneurysm."
cardiovascular system,527,Which of the following is typically associated with traumatic rupture of the aorta?,Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the left,Elevation of the left mainstem bronchus,Fractures of the lower ribs,History of penetrating chest trauma,Widened mediastinum,E,"The thoracic aorta is at risk in any patient sustaining a significant decelerating force (e.g. fall from a height or high speed road traffic accident, not from penetrating injuries). Widening of the mediastinum may have been overlooked on the original AP radiograph. This is a sensitive sign of aortic rupture, though not very specific: 90% of widened mediastina are due to venous bleeding. Other features frequently associated with aortic rupture are:  Fractures of the upper three ribs Deviation of the trachea to the right Depression of the left mainstem bronchus Deviation of the nasogastric tube to the right Loss of the aortic knob, and Pleural capping."
cardiovascular system,528,A 65-year-old woman undergoes temporary pacing due to complete heart block following acute myocardial infarction. Which coronary artery is most likely to have been occluded?,Anterior descending ,Circumflex ,Left main coronary,Obtuse marginal ,Right coronary,E,"Myocardial infarction complicated by bradycardia is most commonly seen in inferior wall myocardial infarction. This area of the heart is supplied by the right coronary artery. The right coronary artery gives off branches to the sinus node and AV node, therefore disease within this vessel can cause damage to the cardiac conducting system and can thus lead to bradyarrhythmias. The anterior descending is a branch of the left main coronary artery often showing as ST elevation in V1-6 depending on where in the left main or the descending branch. The cirucmflex branch of the left main artery leads to inferior-lateral/posterior wall and lead changes.  The obtuse marginal artery would show an isolated lateral wall infarction."
cardiovascular system,529,A 72-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus presented following the sudden onset of palpitations. An ECG revealed rapid atrial fibrillation. He was commenced on amiodarone but the atrial fibrillation persisted. Which of the following has been shown to be of greatest benefit in reducing his future risk of vascular events?,Anticoagulation ,Aspirin,Continuation of amiodarone,DC cardioversion ,Digoxin ,A,"Both sustained and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) are associated with a relatively high incidence of thromboembolism and stroke. Clinical trials have demonstrated that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke in patients with AF. This benefit outweighs the risk of bleeding. Newer dats favours the use of direct oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, as they require no monitoring, have a lower bleeding risk and reduce the chance of VTE compared to warfarin."
cardiovascular system,530,"A 75-year-old man attends the Emergency department with a four hour history of cold, pulseless and painful left foot. He is unable to walk but previously could manage 100 metres before stopping due to leg pain. Examining his lower limbs, he is able to move his left foot but has parasthesia. Only the right femoral pulse is palpable. Which of the following would be the best option?",Angiogram andamp; angioplasty/stent,CT angiogram,Discharge with outpatient follow up,Duplex scan,Embolectomy,A,"This man has presented with acute on chronic limb ischaemia. This is unlikely to be acute limb ischaemia as he does not have normal pulses in the other leg and he has a history of claudication. He has either had an acute event in pre-existing atheroma or, less likely, an embolic event. He has paraesthesia and so needs urgent intervention and not any further diagnostic information. An angiogram is the best tool as angioplasty/stenting can be performed if appropriate. Then it can be decided to proceed to bypass if necessary. A CT angiogram will only provide diagnostic information and is not therapeutic. An embolectomy is unlikely to be beneficial unless the angiogram confirms an embolus."
cardiovascular system,531,"A 28-year-old man with a known history of congenital heart disease presents with a pansystolic murmur, large V waves in the JVP, and pulsatile hepatomegaly. Which of the following types of congenital heart disease is most likely to be associated with this presentation?",Atrial septal defect,Coarctation of the aorta,Ebstein's anomaly,Patent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,C,"The clinical features suggest tricuspid regurgitation. The correct answer is therefore Ebstein's anomaly. The hemodynamic consequences of Ebstein anomaly result from displaced and malformed tricuspid leaflets and atrialization of the right ventricle. The leaflet anomaly leads to tricuspid regurgitation. The severity of regurgitation depends on the extent of leaflet displacement, ranging from mild regurgitation with minimally displaced tricuspid leaflets to severe regurgitation with extreme displacement.

cardiovascular system,532,"A 61-year-old Caucasian patient presents at a busy outpatient clinic. She had a hysterectomy in her 40s for symptomatic fibroids following completion of her family, and developed pre-eclampsia in both of her pregnancies. She is a current and lifelong smoker, takes no alcohol and previously worked as a secretary. Present medication consists of Premarin 300 mcg OD, salbutamol PRN, Seretide BD On examination, her blood pressure is 145/90 mmHg. Chest auscultation was normal. Examination is otherwise unremarkable, with normal fundoscopy, urine dip and ECG. Which additional strategy would be advisable with respect to her hypertension?",Increase amlodipine to 10 mg,Prescribe ramipril 10 mg,Prescribe spironolactone 25 mg,Repeat blood pressure later,Screen for phaeochromocytoma,D,"The incidental abnormality seen in the stressful situation of an outpatient clinic requires observation. Current guidelines advocate offering ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) should a reading exceeding 140/90 mmHg be obtained, primarily at the end of the current consultation. In ambulatory monitoring, use the average value of at least 14 measurements taken during the person's usual waking hours to confirm a diagnosis of hypertension Those without a prior diagnosis of hypertension merit two further checks, one month apart, before starting pharmacotherapy, with advice to modify lifestyle factors (dietary, exercise, alcohol and caffeine intake, smoking) in the interim. Calcium channel blockers are presently recommended as first line treatment in those over 55, or all patients of African or Caribbean descent. If a Calcium channel blocker is not suitable, for example because of oedema or intolerance, or if there is evidence of heart failure or a high risk of heart failure, offer a thiazide-like diuretic. If diuretic treatment is to be initiated or changed, offer a thiazide-like diuretic, such as chlortalidone (12.5-25.0 mg once daily) or indapamide (1.5 mg modified-release or 2.5 mg once daily) in preference to a conventional thiazide diuretic such as bendroflumethiazide or hydrochlorothiazide Those under 55 with hypertension are advised to start on an ACE inhibitor at first (or ARB blocker should they be intolerant). The starting dose of ramipril is lower than that given in option B (1.25 mg rather than 10 mg), which is uptitrated in the absence of hypotension depending on satisfactory renal function. Though polypharmacy is in general to be avoided, in a patient with recognised hypertension adding in a second drug is more effective than increasing doses of a first drug. Screening for phaeochromocytoma through assaying a 24 hour urine collection is advocated in patients with more convincing signs of the disease, such as labile blood pressures exceeding 180/10 mmHg, symptoms including headache and palpitations, and signs of end organ involvement including papilloedema, haematuria, and left ventricular hypertrophy.

How should this patient be treated?",Salbutamol nebulisers,Insulin Dextrose,Stop Ramipril and recheck Us and Es in one week,Calcium resonium,Calcium Gluconate,C,"This patient has hyperkalaemia <6.5 mmol/l and no evidence of ECG changes therefore no further treatment is required except stopping the causative agent and rechecking Us and Es. Calcium resonium is useful for potasiium between 5.5 and 6.5 mmol/l but only if there is evidence of anuria or oliguria. Insulin dextrose, salbutamol nebulisers and calcium gluconate are utilised in the management of hyperkalaemia when the potassium is over 6.5mmol/l and/or ECG changes."
cardiovascular system,535,"A 45-year-old HIV-seropositive man attended the outpatient clinic for the results of a fasting serum lipid test. He had been diagnosed with HIV disease two years previously and was started on highly active antiretroviral therapy. One year after commencing antiretrovirals, his CD4 count had risen from 10 cells/mm^3 to 120 cells/mm^3 with an undetectable viral load. His current medications consisted of zidovudine, lamivudine, lopinavir, aciclovir, fluconazole, and co-trimoxazole. Fasting lipid profile revealed:    Serum cholesterol 4.1 mmol/L (less than5.2)   Serum triglyceride 18.2 mmol/L (0.45-1.69)    Which of the following medications is most likely to be responsible for these results?",Co-trimoxazole,Fluconazole,Lamivudine,Lopinavir,Zidovudine,D,"Lipodystrophy, lipoatrophy, and alterations in serum lipid values have been observed in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease who are taking highly active antiretroviral therapy. Elevated serum lipid levels have been associated with premature coronary artery disease. Hypertriglyceridaemia is also thought to contribute to central fat deposition and insulin resistance that is also seen in these patients. Abnormalities of serum lipid levels are likely to be multifactorial in patients with HIV disease, but appear much commoner in patients taking protease inhibitors. Isolated hypertriglyceridaemia can occur in HIV disease in the absence of protease inhibitors, but extremely high serum triglycerides have been documented in some patients treated with these drugs. If the elevation in lipid levels is modest, measures such as dietary modification and exercise may be tried first. Omega-3 fish oils may also be beneficial in reducing modestly elevated serum triglycerides. In refractory cases, or where there is extreme isolated hypertriglyceridaemia, a fibrate should be used. In addition, patients with HIV disease may also have elevated serum lipid levels due to familial hyperlipidaemia."

At her next consultation she reports a concerted effort to address lifestyle factors over the preceding year, leading to substantial weight loss. She has also given up occasional smoking since her retirement, and is currently asymptomatic. On clinical examination the blood pressure is 126/78 mmHg. BMI 22.4 kg/m^2. The apex is undisplaced.

Her blood pressure has normalised in the absence of precipitating environmental factors, providing an opportune moment to trial withdrawal of pharmacotherapy. She is at low cardiovascular risk, and the dose of ACE inhibitor should be tapered with a view to stopping it altogether. Aspirin is not advised for primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease in a low-risk population, as the risk-benefit ratio is unconvincing in this population. Continued weight loss may be beneficial to her overall health, but there is little room for improvement in her blood pressure so there is nothing against reducing her tablets now. Note the borderline abnormalities in protein and albumin levels. A high protein level in the presence of low albumin level may indicate a surreptitious monoclonal gammopathy, and considering myeloma is advisable at this stage (though it is not part of management of blood pressure, and therefore an incorrect answer to this question). Serum calcium, immunoglobulins, electrophoresis, and urinary electrophoresis/Bence Jones protein assay complete a myeloma screen, with imaging only being carried out should these be suggestive of myeloma. A urine dipstick rather than 24 hour protein collection would be more advisable in the first instance as a negative test would exclude significant renal protein losses. "
cardiovascular system,537,Which one of the following clinical features is compatible with hypertension?,Fifth heart sound,Loud aortic fourth heart sound,Retinal haemorrhages and soft exudates,Tapping apex beat,Third heart sound,C,"Hypertensive patients usually have no specific symptoms or signs. Abnormal signs usually only appear after a period of prolonged, severe hypertension. A fourth heart sound is due to increased atrial activity. It occurs in diastole, preceding the first heart sound and can occur in any form of left ventricular disease. Hypertension is associated with left ventricular hypertrophy, and causes a thrusting apex beat, in contrast to the tapping apex beat characteristic of mitral stenosis. A loud aortic second heart sound is a classical finding in hypertension. A third heart sound may be a normal finding in patients under 40 years of age. A pathological third heart sound occurs with:  Mitral and tricuspid regurgitation Constrictive pericarditis A dilated left ventricle, and Acute myocardial infarction.  Hypertensive retinopathy is graded as follows:  Grade 1 - arterial narrowing Grade 2 - arteriovenous nipping Grade 3 - haemorrhages and exudates Grade 4 - all of the above plus papilloedema."

The procedure had been performed without sedation following an intratracheal injection of 5 ml 2.5% cocaine solution and xylocaine spray to the pharynx for topical anaesthesia. ECG showed an evolving anterior myocardial infarction. Which of the following would you prefer for his management?,Beta blockers,Nitrates,Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty,Thrombolysis with rt-PA,Thrombolysis with streptokinase,B,"The underlying mechanism here is vasoconstriction, not thrombosis. Cocaine is cardiotoxic and its use has been linked to:  Coronary artery spasm Angina Myocardial infarction Arrhythmias Sudden cardiac death, and Myocardial contraction bands, which might act as a substrate for arrhythmias.  It is important to avoid beta blockers in treating cocaine induced chest pains or acute myocardial infarctions, as this may result in unopposed 1 adrenergic action with worsening coronary spasm. Calcium channel antagonists or nitrates should be administered as early as possible."
cardiovascular system,539,A left-to-right shunt is a feature of which congenital heart defect?,Eisenmenger's syndrome,Hypoplastic left heart syndrome,Patent ductus arteriosus,Persistent truncus arteriosus,Tetralogy of Fallot,C,"The commonest examples of a left-to-right shunt are:  Atrial septal defect (ASD) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).  Children with this defect (left-to-right shunt) are usually not cyanosed (providing there is no left ventricular failure or reversal of the shunt). Eisenmenger's syndrome occurs when there is reversal of the left-to-right shunt (to a right-to-left shunt), due to irreversible pulmonary vessel disease. Hypoplastic left heart syndrome results in a failure to pump adequate blood around the heart, resulting in cyanosis. Persistent truncus arteriosus results in an incomplete division of the aorta and pulmonary trunk. Neither of these conditions results in a shunt. Fallot's tetralogy is the commonest form of a right-to-left shunt, and the children are cyanosed."
cardiovascular system,540,A 60-year-old man's echocardiogram shows a dilated left ventricular (LV) cavity with the remainder of the other chamber sizes normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Aortic regurgitation (AR),Aortic stenosis (AS),Hypertensive heart disease,Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,Mitral stenosis (MS),A,"No echocardiographic data are provided regarding the valves, but a volume overload as with AR would result in dilatation of the left ventricle. AS, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and hypertension would have the effect of causing hypertrophy and a smaller LV cavity. MS would have little effect on LV dimensions. Clinical examination and ECHO following the findings would be the next step in classifiying the abnormalities auscultated."
cardiovascular system,541,A 56-year-old male with left ventricular systolic dysfunction was dyspnoeic on climbing stairs but not at rest. The patient was commenced on ramipril and furosemide. Which one of the following drugs would improve the patient's prognosis?,Amiodarone,Amlodipine,Bisoprolol,Digoxin,Nitrate therapy,C,This patient has NYHA stage II heart failure. Studies such as CIBIS-II and MERIT-HF reveal that beta blockers significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in heart failure. The other therapies can be used in certain circumstance to help improve symptoms.
cardiovascular system,542,On auscultation of the heart of a 30-year-old female a loud first heart sound is heard. Which of the following may be responsible for this auscultatory feature?,A long preceding diastolic interval,Atrial premature beat,Increased pulmonary arterial pressure,Increased systemic arterial pressure,Rupture of a papillary muscle,B,"A loud first heart sound is due to abrupt closure of the mitral valve against a high left atrial pressure and may occur with shortened diastole, mitral stenosis or left-right shunts. It can also be heard with atrial premature beats. Mitral regurgitation occurs with papillary muscle rupture and thereby the first heart sound is soft. A2 and P2 are loud in systemic hypertension and pulmonary hypertension respectively."
cardiovascular system,543,A 63 year old lady is found to have a small pericardial effusion incidentally on ECHO.  She is asymptomatic and she is haemodynamically stable.  What is the next most appropriate step in her management?,Reassure,Cardiac catheterisation,Diagnostic tap,Pericardiocentesis,Coronary Angiography,A,This patient can be reassured as there is no need for pericardiocentesis is the patient is asymptomatic and is haemodynamically stable.  It is indicated if there is symptoms or haemodynamic compromise or fluid is required for diagnosis.
cardiovascular system,544,Which of the following is not associated with left atrial myxoma?,A mid-systolic click,Adrenal hyperplasia,Left atrial dilatation,Sudden death,Systemic emboli,A,"Atrial myxomas in the heart make up 50% of primary cardiac tumours. They are most common in the left atrium arising from a pedicle on the fossa ovalis. One third present with emboli, a third with systemic inflammation (erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] elevated in a third), and a third are asymptomatic when detected. They can intermittently flop through the mitral valve and cause a mid-diastolic click (tumour plop) when they stop moving. Elevated left atrial pressures cause dilatation. Syncope can occur due to obstruction. They are more common in women. Carney's complex is a familial multiple neoplasia and lentiginosis syndrome, associated with:  Primary adrenal hypercortisolism Lentigines and naevi of the skin Various tumours including myxoma."
cardiovascular system,545,"A 30 year old female who is 28 weeks pregnant presents with palpitations. On examination you find her heart rate to be 180. She is placed on a cardiac monitor which reveals a broad complex tachycardia. She is hypotensive, she feels short of breath and on auscultation of the chest there is evidence of bibasal crackles. How should this patient be managed?",IV verapamil,Non synchronised DC cardioversion,IV amiodarone,Synchronised DC cardioversion with monitoring of foetal heart rate,IV adenosine,D,This patient presents with a tachyarrhythmia which is unstable as there is features of hypotension and heart failure. Urgent synchronised DC is therefore required. DC cardioversion can be performed in pregnancy as it shouldn't affect foetal heart rate however the foetal heart rhythm should be monitored.
cardiovascular system,546,"A 57-year-old man having hypertension is on oral anti-hypertensive. However, he is finding it difficult to mobilize as he feels dizzy whenever he tries to get up. What is the most appropriate investigation for him?",Ambulatory BP,ECG,MRI,CXR,CT,A,Ambulatory BP to document low BP as cause of presenting symptom. The case seems to be of postural hypotension and low BP as a result of given anti- hypertensive
cardiovascular system,547,"A 58 year old man who is a heavy smoker presents with severe epigastric pain radiating to his jaw.  On examination he is bradycardic and hypotensive and an ECG reveals ST elevation in  leads II, III and aVF.  What diagnosis fits best with this clinical picture?",Unstable angina,Inferior NSTEMI,Anterolateral STEMI,Pancreatitis,Inferior STEMI,E,The history of jaw pain should make you suspicious of cardiac pain despite the epigastric nature initially.  The ST elevation in the inferior leads confirms this man is suffering from an inferior STEMI.
cardiovascular system,548,"A 58-year-old male has a six year history of hypertension for which he is receiving Candesartan, Amlodipine, Bendroflumethiazide, and Aliskiren. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of Aliskiren?",Aldosterone synthase inhibitor,Aldosterone receptor blocker,Bradykinin inhibitor,Direct renin inhibitor,Second generation angiotensin receptor antagonist,D,"Aliskiren is a direct renin inhibitor and represents the first new class of drug available in over a decade for the treatment of hypertension. Renin has long been recognized as a possible site for blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS) because it catalyses conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I and is a rate-limiting step in the RAS cascade. Aliskiren binds to the active site of the renin molecule, blocking angiotensinogen cleavage, thus, preventing the formation of angiotensin I. Clinical studies have demonstrated at least equivalent blood pressure lowering efficacy compared with existing drugs with a favourable side effect profile."
cardiovascular system,549,"A 61-year-old Caucasian patient presents to the gastroenterology clinic following a three month history of malaise with no other specific symptoms. She had a hysterectomy in her 40s for symptomatic fibroids following completion of her family, and developed pre-eclampsia in both of her pregnancies. She is a current and lifelong smoker, takes no alcohol, and previously worked as a secretary. Present medication consists of Premarin 300 mcg OD, salbutamol PRN, Seretide BD, and amlodipine 5 mg OD. On examination the patient is pale with normal capillary refill time. The heart rate is 72, sinus rhythm. Blood pressure is 168/95 mmHg. Chest auscultation revealed neither crackles nor wheeze. Examination is otherwise unremarkable, with normal fundoscopy, urine dip, and ECG. Iron deficiency anaemia is seen on full blood count, and outpatient endoscopy is organised. Which of the following is not a risk factor for the patient's pre-existent hypertension?",Hormone replacement therapy,Multiparity,Obstructive airway disease,Prior pre-eclampsia,Smoking,C,"This patient with iron deficiency anaemia presents with incidental hypertension, which may be multifactorial. Hypertension has classically been described in a male population, though relevant risk factors have been more recently identified in women. These include:  Multiple previous pregnancies Menopause Hysterectomy, and Hormone replacement therapy.  Though obstructive airway disease can cause pulmonary hypertension, and smoking is a well-recognised risk factor for arterial hypertension, in isolation it is not a cause of systemic hypertension. Obstructive airway disease induced by familial α-1 antitrypsin deficiency is not associated with systemic hypertension. Pre-eclampsia is a risk factor for consequent hypertension. Interestingly, active smokers appear to have a lower incidence of pre-eclampsia. Note that this patient takes unopposed oestrogen, which is safe in her case following hysterectomy though inadvisable in patients with an intact uterus due to the risk of endometrial carcinoma. "
cardiovascular system,550,"A patient with central crushing chest pain associated with autonomic features has 1 mm of ST elevation in leads II,III and aVF.  How do you manage this patient?",Aspirin + clopidogrel +LMWH and repeat ECG,Thrombolysis,PCI,Repeat ECG,Heparin only,A,"Thrombolysis/ Primary PCI is not indicated as there needs to be 1 mm ST elevation in two or more limb leads or 2 mm ST elevation in adjacent chest leads.   There is only 1 mm ST elevation in this case.  In those where there is a good history and ECG changes then  treatment for ACS should begin with aspirin, clopidogrel and LMWH and serial ECGs should be done in this case as he may well become a PCI candidate."
cardiovascular system,551,Which of the following are characteristic electrocardiogram (ECG) features of hypokalaemia?,Flattened P waves,ST elevation,U waves,Ventricular tachycardia,Wide QRS,C,"U waves are characteristic features of hypokalaemia. Further ECG features of hypokalaemia include ST depression, low amplitude T waves, and ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular tachycardia is thought to be exceedingly rare in hypokalaemia. The remaining answers are ECG findings typical of hyperkalaemia, together with absent P waves, tall tented t waves, asystole, and ventricular fibrillation. "
cardiovascular system,552,"A 52-year-old man with history of anterior MI 3 weeks ago developed sudden onset of dyspnea. Examination: BP 100/60 mmHg, pulse 100 bpm, SaO2 88%, chest bilateral crackles. Which investigation would you do to find the underlying cause?",CXR,Echo,D-dimer,Radionucleotide lung scan,Troponin,B,Sudden papillary muscle rupture or VSD may be the likely cause (ventricular aneurism may take a more slower course) so echo is more logical approach
cardiovascular system,553,"A 72-year-old man presents with an episode of sudden collapse. He has had two similar episodes recently, each lasting about one minute. Four years ago he suffered an anterior myocardial infarction. On examination he was orientated and symptom-free with a regular pulse rate of 80 bpm, BP 140/80 mmHg, and the apex beat was displaced to the left. There was an apical systolic murmur. There were no signs of trauma. ECG showed sinus rhythm, Q waves, and ST segment elevation anteriorly without reciprocal depression. Which of the following is the diagnosis?",Acute anterior myocardial infarction,Cerebrovascular accident,Epileptic seizure,Pulmonary embolism,Ventricular tachycardia,E,"The electrocardiogram is suggestive of a left ventricular (LV) aneurysm, which has a tendency for both a malignant arrhythmogenic focus and also for left ventricular thrombus. The brief episode of loss of consciousness with no residual neurology makes the diagnosis for cerebral embolism unlikely. The story is more suggestive of a ventricular tachycardia (VT) and would suggest further investigations. Prolonged heart rhythm monitoring and an echo are recommended. If VT is proven then he should be on amiodarone and the indication for an automated implantable cardioverter/defibrillator strongly considered if the overall LV function is reduced."
cardiovascular system,554,A 60-year-old woman has a systolic murmur. As part of the evaluation you listen to the murmur during a Valsalva manoeuvre and the murmur becomes louder. Which of the following systolic murmurs becomes louder with a Valsalva?,Aortic stenosis,Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM),Mitral flow murmur,Mitral regurgitation,Ventricular septal defect,B,Most murmurs of stenosis or regurgitation are exaggerated during squatting and get softer with the Valsalva manoeuvre. The exceptions are HOCM where the opposite occurs and mitral valve prolapse where the murmur gets longer.
cardiovascular system,555,A 55-year-old male with ischaemic heart disease is seen for review. He has recently started 40 mg of simvastatin. He reports that he has developed some muscle aches and pains since starting the statin. His creatine kinase is within the normal range. Which of the following is the most appropriate management of this patient's cardiovascular risk?,Add cholestyramine,Add gemfibrozil,Stop simvastatin and try nicotinic acid,Stop simvastatin and try pravastatin,Stop simvastatin and presribe rosuvastatin,E,"In this patient, who is young and has established IHD, statin treatment is the gold standard of lipid care. None of the other options have as robust an evidence base for improved survival when compared with statin treatment. This patient likely has statin-induced myalgia. This side effect is common and can be debilitating for patients, but fortunately is not life-threatening. Serious muscle related adverse effects are rare and include myositis (CK elevated with symptoms) and rhabdomyolysis. It is important to check the CK in all patients with statin related muscle symptoms to exclude these serious causes. Myalgia can gradually improve with time, dose reduction, or changing to an alternative statin. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin are metabolised via different pathways when compared to simvastatin and atorvastatin. Pravastatin may be suitable for primary prevention, but in this high-risk secondary prevention patient, a stronger agent is required. Rosuvastatin can be effective at even low doses (5-10 mg) and would be the agent of choice here. Adding gemfibrozil would not be recommended as the risk of myositis and rhabdomyolysis increases with the statin-fibrate combination. This may be particularly relevant to this patient who already has statin related adverse effects. Cholestyramine and nicotinic acid are useful agents but are limited due to tolerability issues. They also cannot match the benefit in survival that an alternative statin could give."
cardiovascular system,556,"A 60-year-old woman with a two year history of diet controlled type 2 diabetes was admitted with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). She received thrombolysis together with an insulin infusion and has done well, apart from mild ankle swelling which has been managed with a small dose of furosemide. Investigations revealed a fasting glucose of 12 mmol/L (3.0-6.0) together with a cholesterol of 6.6 mmol/L (less than5.2). Her HbA1c was 60 mmol/mol (20-42). Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for her subsequent glycaemic control?",Continue diet alone,Gliclazide modified release,Metformin,Pioglitazone,Subcutaneous insulin,E,"Following DIGAMI-1 study, it was assumed that three months of insulin was appropriate post-MI. However, DIGAMI-2 which specifically looked at mortality found no differences between control with oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHAs), insulin, or routine metabolic management. In the BNF, metform in is listed as contraindicated within six weeks of MI. Therefore, in this patient we should aim for tighter glycaemic control and probably subcutaneous insulin would be most appropriate here in the first instance, with an early review of glycaemic control at six weeks. The option then would be to switch to metformin. In view of the mild heart failure, pioglitazone should be avoided."
cardiovascular system,557,"A 52-year-old sales representative is admitted with an inferior myocardial infarction (MI). He receives thrombolysis and makes an uneventful recovery. He is discharged on atenolol, aspirin and atorvastatin. He enquires how long after his MI must he wait before he is able to drive?",One week,Two weeks,Four weeks,Three months,Six months,C,"The DVLA guideance states that he must wait at least four weeks after his MI before he is able to drive. Similarly, patients undergoing surgical revascularisation must also wait four weeks. If he was admitted with angina and underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) then he should wait one week. "
cardiovascular system,558,"A 65 year old gentleman has an anterolateral myocardial infarction. He has primary PCI and a drug eluting stent is inserted. However 24 hours later he complains of further chest pain. There is ST elevation in leads II, III and aVf. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Rupture of atherosclerotic plaque,Ventricular Aneurysm,Coronary artery spasm,Emboli,Stent thrombosis,A,This patient is most likely suffering from another STEMI. The original event was ischaemia in the anterolateral area and a drug eluting stent in inserted. However there is recurrence of chest pain however the pathology is in the inferior leads and therefore in a separate area making it more likely to be a separate atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Stent thrombosis can occur in the first 24-48 hours however the area affected would most likely be the anterolateral region.
cardiovascular system,559,Which of the following lipid abnormalities are most likely to be detected in a patient with type 2 diabetes and the underlying mechanism which may contribute to further lipid abnormalities?,Elevated HDL concentrations,Elevated LDL concentrations,Large buoyant LDL molecules,Reduced triglyceride concentrations,Small dense LDL molecules,E,"In type 2 diabetes, increased cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity results in the transfer of triglycerides from very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). This results in small, dense LDL which is more atherogenic, being able to be oxidised more readily and penetrate endothelium and macrophages. LDL is not typically elevated in type 2 diabetes although there are qualitative changes as indicated above. HDL is typically low in the patient with type 2 diabetes. Triglycerides are often elevated with poor glycaemic control."
cardiovascular system,560,A 74-year-old man presented with intermittent chest pain at rest. Which one of the following would most strongly suggest that the pain was due to myocardial ischaemia?,Associated dyspnoea ,Coexistent claudication ,Past history of cigarette smoking ,Radiation of pain to the jaw ,Relief of pain by sublingual nitrate ,D,"Nitrates may relieve the pain of oesophageal spasm, as well as that of myocardial ischaemia. Associated dyspnoea may be due to anxiety. Coexistent claudication suggests the presence of peripheral vascular disease. A past history of cigarette smoking is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. However, the most specific feature of the given options which suggests that the pain is myocardial ischaemia, is the radiation to the jaw, which is relatively specific for pain of myocardial ischaemia. The next step would be an ECG and serial troponins to assess for muscle damage. Initiation of treatment in a timely manor is crucial in the managment of STEMI."
cardiovascular system,561,"A 70 year old female with heart failure on ramipril, furosemide and bisoprolol presents with increasing shortness of breath.  What is the most appropriate management?",Stop bisoprolol,Increase furosemide,Add digoxin,Add ISMN,Add spironolactone,E,Digoxin can be useful for symptom control after diuretics and ACE inhibitors have been optimised however have no effect on survival.  Spironolactone improves symptoms and improves survival in severe heart failure.  Bisoprolol should not be stopped as now not recommended and has been shown to have mortality benefits.
cardiovascular system,562,"A 56-year-old man was recently put on anti-hypertensive medications and recent biochemistry on 2 occasions showed: Na+ 132, K+ 7.6, Urea 11.3, Creatinine 112.

cardiovascular system,563,A 56 year old man is 48 hours post STEMI and suddenly develops pulmonary oedema.  He looks unwell with a BP of 90/50mmHg and a heart rate of 105 bpm.  He has bibasal crackles and a pansystolic murmur on auscultation.  What investigation due you organise?,Urgent echocardiogram,CXR,Troponin T,ECG,Cardiac Angiography,A,The man is likely to have had rupture of the papillary muscle and thus MR leading to acute pulmonary oedema and thus an ECHO is the most appropriate investigation.  He requires intotropic support and discussion with cardiothoracic surgeons.
cardiovascular system,564,Which of the following drugs acts predominantly as a potassium channel blocker?,Digoxin,Atenolol,Amiodarone,Verapamil,Quinidine,C,"Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug which has other effects but affects on the sodium, calcium and beta receptors however it also acts as a potassium channel blocker which prolongs the action potential and repolarisation. Verapamil is a class IV and is a calcium channel blocker. Atenolol is a beta blocker. Digoxin acts on the the Na K ATPase. Quinidine is a class Ia antiarrhythmic and acts predominantly through sodium channel blockade."
cardiovascular system,565,"A woman presents with history of falls, becomes pale and clumsy. She is hypertensive and takes atenolol, bendroflumethiazide and amlodipine. What investigation is needed?",24h ECG,24h BP monitoring,ECG,Echo,CT head,B,All these drugs (particularly prolonged use of thiazide and amlodipine) are well established cause of postural hypotension. So 24 hour BP monitoring should be done
cardiovascular system,566,"A 45-year-old male with type 1 diabetes and with a number of complex diabetic gastrointestinal complications is noted to have a PR interval of 0.18 s, a QRS duration of 0.1 s and a QT interval of 0.48 s on routine ECG. Which one of the following drugs is most likely to be responsible?",Cimetidine ,Co-trimoxazole ,Domperidone,Erythromycin ,Octreotide ,D,"Erythromycin has been associated with prolonged QT interval and torsades de pointes, and is used in diabetic gastropathy, although its benefits in the condition are not entirely understood. Rarely, domperidone has been reported to prolong QT. Prolonged QT is defined as greater than 0.45s. Other agents include amitriptyline and phenothiazines yet metoclopramide and domperidone are not associated."
cardiovascular system,567,"A 70-year-old man is admitted with an acute Q wave inferior myocardial infarction (MI). On day five, he suddenly develops pulmonary oedema and a loud systolic murmur. Which of the following would be the most useful in establishing a diagnosis?",Chest x ray,Coronary arteriography,ECG,Right heart catheterisation and oximetry,Serum cardiac enzymes,D,"This patient has developed acute left ventricular failure (LVF) five days after an inferior MI. Things to think about include mitral valve (MV) prolapse, ventricular septal defect (VSD), or acute pericardial effusion/haemorrhage. Right heart studies would provide information on left atrium (LA) pressures and suggestive information on the most likely diagnosis: MV prolapse."
cardiovascular system,568,Specific heart muscle disease may result from which of the following?,Addison's,Carcinoid syndrome,Cholera,Scleroderma,Vitamin B12 deficiency,D,"Specific heart muscle disease may occur in:  Amyloid Association with myopathies per se (dystrophica myotonica) Thiamine deficiency (wet beri beri) Cushing's disease (steroid induced cardiomyopathy), and Drugs (e.g. cisplatin).  In carcinoid syndrome, there is an effect on the valves with fibrosis, but not directly on the myocytes."
cardiovascular system,569,A 62-year-old lady is due to attend her dentist for a hygiene appointment for scaling. She has a history of mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation and is allergic to penicillin. Which of the following antibiotics would be the most appropriate choice for prophylaxis in this lady?,No antibiotic prophylaxis,Oral clindamycin,Oral doxycycline,Oral erythromycin,Oral ofloxacin,A,NICE guidance on Prophylaxis against infective endocarditis (CG64) suggests that prophylaxis is not required during dental procedures.
cardiovascular system,570,A 65-year-old is investigated for dyspnoea and is shown to have an ejection fraction of 45% on echocardiography. How is left ventricular ejection fraction calculated?,Cardiac output/stroke volume,End diastolic volume/end systolic volume,End diastolic volume/stroke volume,End systolic volume/end diastolic volume,Stroke volume/end diastolic volume,E,The left ventricle pumps only a fraction of the blood it contains. The ejection fraction is the amount of blood pumped (stroke volume = end diastolic volume − end systolic volume) divided by the amount of blood the ventricle contains (end diastolic volume). A normal ejection fraction is more than 55% of the blood volume.
cardiovascular system,571,A 26 year old patient is found incidentally to have a harsh pansystolic murmur at the lower left sternal edge. He is asymptomatic and both CXR and ECG are normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Aortic atenosis,Atrial septal defect,Patent ductus arteriosus,Ventricular septal defect,Mitral regurgitation,D,This murmur is most likely secondary to a small VSD. Patients are normally asymptomatic and CXR and ECGs normal.
cardiovascular system,572,"A 68-year-old woman was admitted to hospital with severe acute dyspnoea. She denied having any chest pain but said that she had become progressively breathless over the past three months. On examination, her pulse was 120 beats per minute and regular. Her blood pressure was 95/55 mmHg and her jugular venous pressure was elevated to the angle of the jaw. Her heart sounds were normal. Auscultation of her chest revealed bilateral fine inspiratory crackles to the mid zones. She had haemorrhages in both fundi. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 56 g/L (115-165)   Haematocrit 0.19 (0.36-0.47)   MCV 118 fL (80-96)   MCH 33.0 pg (28-32)   White cell count 3.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 95 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum vitamin B12 Result pending   Serum folate Result pending    The ECG showed left bundle branch block, which had been documented previously. She is given 80 mg of intravenous furosemide which results in an excellent diuresis. Which of the following is the next most appropriate immediate step in her management?",Blood transfusion,Bone marrow aspiration,Start intramuscular vitamin B12 and oral folic acid,Start oral ferrous sulphate,Thrombolyse with t-PA,A,"The clinical picture represents severe megaloblastic anaemia with cardiac failure. The question asks about immediate management. Although the anaemia has been developing slowly, she has become acutely haemodynamically compromised. In such circumstances, it would be most appropriate to transfuse the patient. This would need to be done very cautiously with diuretic cover. She will clearly need to start an intensive course of intramuscular vitamin B12 and oral folic acid as well, but this is less important in the hyperacute situation where there is a risk of the patient dying from anaemia. Giving oral folic acid without vitamin B12 would be hazardous and could precipitate subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord. Transfusion may also be hazardous in a patient with severe congestive cardiac failure (CCF)."
cardiovascular system,573,"A 35-year-old male presents with shortness of breath. On examination, one notes a mid-diastolic rumbling murmur. He has an echocardiogram which confirms mitral stenosis.  What is the most common cause of mitral stenosis?",Calcification,Infective endocarditis,Malignant carcinoid syndrome,Mitral Valve Prolapse,Rheumatic fever,E,"Mitral stenosis is a valvular heart disease characterised by the narrowing of the orifice of the mitral valve of the heart. The most common cause is rheumatic fever which presents on average 16 years after the initial episode of rheumatic fever. Infective endocarditis is the second most common cause of mitral stenosis. In pregnancy, mitral stenosis is the most common murmur. Other rarer causes of mitral stenosis include:  congenital heart disease annular calcification endomyocardial fibroelastosis malignant carcinoid syndrome systemic lupus erythematosus Whipple's disease Fabry disease rheumatoid arthritis hurler' disease hunter's disease, and amyloidosis.  Of the list of options, mitral valve prolapse presents clinically as mitral regurgitation. Further reading:  Bonow, Robert O.; Mann, Douglas L.; Zipes, Douglas P.; Peter Libby M.D. (2012).

Unfortunately, in the past few months his symptoms have worsened and he is becoming housebound. His wife has accompanied him and is worried about his state. She asks you directly: andquot;How long has he got left?andquot; You tell his wife that certain test results can suggest a worse prognosis. From the list, which blood test result suggests a worse prognosis in heart failure?",Hypocalcaemia,Hyponatraemia,Low serum BNP/ NT-pro-BNP,Low serum uric acid,Polycythaemia,B,"Heart failure is a chronic condition with a high morbidity and mortality. There are a number of clinical features and biochemical parameters which provide useful prognostic information. Prognostic markers include:  High BNP/NT-pro-BNP Anaemia Hyponatraemia, and Increased uric acid.  Serum calcium is not a useful in prognosis in heart failure."
cardiovascular system,575,What is the approximate percentage of the incidence of probe-patent foramen ovale (PFO) in the general population?,5%,10%,15%,20%,30%,E,"The incidence of PFO in the normal population is between 25-30%, as determined by post-mortem examination. Although particularly common, PFO is usually silent through life. It can be associated with paradoxical venous thromboembolism, for example, stroke associated with DVT."
cardiovascular system,576,A 26-year-old man is found to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. A 24 hour ECG recording reveals runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He has had three episodes of syncope in the last two years. Which of the following is the most appropriate management plan for this man?,Amiodarone,AV node ablation,Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD),Permanent pacemaker,Sotalol,C,"When the risk level for sudden cardiac death (SCD) is judged by contemporary criteria to be unacceptably high and deserving of intervention, the ICD is the most effective and reliable treatment option available, harbouring the potential for absolute protection and altering the natural history of this disease in some patients."

Her electrocardiogram was normal and carotid ultrasound reveal a 49% stenosis of the right internal carotid artery, as assessed by the NASCAT criteria. Which is the most appropriate treatment for this patient initally?",Aspirin,Carotid endarterectomy,Dipyridamole,Clopidogrel,Warfarin,A,"NICE guidelines recommend that patients who have had a suspected TIA who are at high risk of a stroke (ABCD score of 4 or above) should have aspirin (300 mg OD) started immediately. They also need specialist assessment and investigation within 24 hours of onset of symptoms. Secondary prevention measures should be introduced as soon as the diagnosis is confirmed, with consideration of individual risk factors. The ABCD scoring system uses:    Age ≥60 1 point   BP ≥140/90 mmHg at initial evaluation 1 point   Clinical features Unilateral weakness 2 points   Isolated speech disturbance 1 point   Other 0 points   Duration of symptoms ≥60 minutes 2 points   10-59 minutes 1 point   less than 10 minutes 0 points   Diabetes mellitus Present 1 point    Although you cannot calculate the ABCD score with the information given in this question, aspirin remains the most appropriate answer. Carotid endarterectomy has been established as an effective treatment for both symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients who are shown to have carotid artery stenosis. It reduces the risk of disabling stroke or death by 48% in a person with severe symptomatic carotid stenosis (greater than70%) who has had a TIA. The perioperative risk of disabling stroke or death is approximately 3%. Current UK guidelines recommend endarterectomy for symptomatic patients with greater than 70% stenosis, based on the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial which showed clear benefit. The endarterectomy should be performed as soon as the patient is fit for surgery, preferably within two weeks of a TIA. The benefit is marginal for symptomatic patients with 50-69% stenosis, but may be greater in male patients. NICE recommends these patients are also considered for endarterectomy. There is significantly less benefit for asymptomatic patients, even those with greater than 60% stenosis. Patients with less than 50% stenosis should not be considered for carotid surgery. Recurrent stenosis can occur in 1-20% of patients following endarterectomy, and re-operation is needed in 1-3% of cases. Ipsilateral strokes occur in 9% of patients following endarterectomy, and 26% of those treated with medical management alone (within 2 years). All patients with suspected non-disabling stroke or TIA who are considered as candidates for carotid endarterectomy should have carotid imaging within 1 week. If the patient has had a disabling stroke there is no real benefit in them undergoing the procedure. Modified-release dipyridamole is indicated in combination with aspirin only once a TIA has been confirmed by a specialist. Alone, it is recommended only if aspirin is contraindicated or not tolerated. Clopidogrel is recommended in patients who have had an ischaemic stroke, rather than a TIA. Warfarin is only indicated with cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, or if the patient has atrial fibrillation. Please note that for this explanation we have used the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterecomy Trial (NASCET) criteria, as opposed to the European Carotid Surgery Trialists' Collaborative Group (ECST) criteria when discussing carotid endarterectomy. Patients should be considered for endarterctomy if they have symptomatic carotid stenosis of 70-99% as assessed according to the ECST criteria. Carotid imaging reports will state which criteria are being used. "
cardiovascular system,578,Which of the following is correct in cardiac transplantation?,Long term hypotension is a problem,Recipients suffer less angina but accelerated coronary artery disease,The donor heart is provided to the recipient with the best human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match,The histology of atheroma in the transplanted heart is the same as that of typical atherosclerosis,There is a 25% five year survival,B,"It is hypertension (rather than hypotension) that is a significant problem in cardiac transplantation. It is related to use of cyclosporin and denervation of the heart. As the heart is denervated recipients suffer less angina but accelerated coronary artery disease. While it is true that kidney transplants go to the recipient with the best human leukocyte antigen (HLA) match, hearts go to the most needy. The histology of atheroma in the transplanted heart is not the same as that of typical atherosclerosis. The pathology is different, being more diffuse and symmetrical. For most centres with conventional selection criteria there is a 75% five year survival."
cardiovascular system,579,Which of the following is true regarding the coronary circulation?,Adenosine is an important mediator of metabolic vasodilatation,Coronary blood flow is independent of myocardial oxygen consumption due to autoregulation,Coronary blood flow within a normal range of blood pressure is primarily determined by perfusion pressure,Increased myocardial O2 demand is met primarily by increasing O2 extraction,The vasodilatory reserve of the epicardium and endocardium is equivalent under normal physiologic conditions,A,"Adenosine has a particularly short half life, acts on specific adenosine cell surface receptors (A1 and A2) and is inactivated by adenosine deaminase. It results in coronary vasodilatation and depression of sinus node automaticity and AVN conduction. Coronary blood flow is dependent on myocardial oxygen consumption and is pretty independently maintained throughout the ranges of blood pressure. Increasing O2 demands are met by increased blood supply facilitated by vasodilatation brought about by adenosine production."
cardiovascular system,580,Which one of the following is true regarding acute pulmonary embolism?,A normal ECG excludes the diagnosis,Embolectomy is more effective than thrombolysis in improving survival,Heparin is as effective as thrombolytic therapy,The presence of hypoxaemia is an indication for thrombolysis,Thrombolysis administered through a peripheral vein is as effective as through a pulmonary artery catheter,E,Embolectomies are rarely done nowadays due to the excellent results with thrombolysis. Thrombolytic therapy is reserved for those with severely compromised circulation (equally effective through peripheral vein or via catheter in pulmonary artery). Heparin reduces risk of further embolism (anticoagulant) and reduces pulmonary vasoconstriction.
cardiovascular system,581,A 55-year-old man is being treated for hyperlipidaemia with atorvastatin 40 mg nocte. He has a history of ischaemic heart disease. His fasting lipids show:    Total cholesterol 3.8 mmol/L (less than5.2)   Triglycerides 1.3 mmol/L (0.5-1.7)   LDL-cholesterol 1.9 mmol/L (less than2.6)   HDL-cholesterol 0.7 mmol/L (0.7-1.7)    Which of the following changes of treatment would be expected to raise his HDL cholesterol level by the greatest amount?,Add cholestyramine,Add ezetimibe,Add fenofibrate,Add nicotinic acid,Switch atorvastatin to rosuvastatin,D,"This is a contentious area which has been the topic of a significant amount of research in recent years. There does seem to be some evidence of positive effects of nicotinic acid in terms of cardiovascular events and atherosclerosis evolution. However, the results of the HPS-THRIVE2 study resulted in the suspension of these treatments in 2013 by the EMA. The current NHS standpoint seems to be that whilst the value of nicotinic acid is limited by its side-effects (especially vasodilatation) it does lower both cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations by inhibiting synthesis and increases HDL-cholesterol when used in doses of 1.5-3g daily. It is recommended for use by specialists in combination with a statin, where a statin alone has failed to adequately control dyslipidaemia.   Further reading: "
cardiovascular system,582,"A 26-year-old female with a small ventriculo-septal defect (VSD) presents in the sixth week of pregnancy. She has been told that she would need antibiotic prophylaxis for dental surgery, and various other procedures. She asks you to tell her whether she will have to take this during her pregnancy, and if so, at which point it will be needed. What advice should you give?",Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated,At delivery,Onset of labour,Second trimester,Third trimester,A,"Infective endocarditis (IE) is a rare condition, but one which carries significant morbidity and mortality. It may arise following bacteraemia in any patient, but those with a predisposing cardiac lesion are at an increased risk. In previous years, at risk patients have been given antibiotic prophylaxis before certain interventional procedures to reduce the risk of developing IE. However, in recent years the lack of a robust evidence base has led to this practice being questioned. In light of this, NICE issued guidance in 2008. These guidelines highlight that the patients at risk of developing IE are those with:  Acquired valvular heart disease (stenosis or regurgitation) Valve replacement Structural congenital heart disease (including surgically corrected or palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect or fully repaired patent ductus arteriosus and closure devices that are judged to be endothelialised) Previous infective endocarditis Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.  In these patients any episodes of infection should be fully investigated and treated promptly to reduce the risk of endocarditis developing. However, prophylaxis is not recommended for undergoing dental procedures, or procedures at the following sites:  Upper and lower gastrointestinal tract Genitourinary tract (including childbirth) Upper and lower respiratory tract (including ENT).  Chlorhexadine mouthwash is also not recommended. The only recommendation for antibiotics is if an at-risk patient is undergoing a gastrointestinal or genitourinary procedure at a site where there is a suspected infection - in these cases an antibiotic should be given that covers organisms that cause IE.

cardiovascular system,583,A patient is diagnosed with infective endocarditis. Which of the following requires urgent surgical intervention?,Prolonged PR interval,Systolic murmur,Shortened PR interval,Mobile vegetation,Pyrexia and raised ESR despite antibiotic therapy,A,"If there is evidence of prolonged PR intervals in a patient with infective endocarditis then an aortic root abscess should be suspected and confirmed with Echo. This requires urgent surgical intervention. Continued raised ESR and pyrexia despite treatment does not require urgent surgical intervention. Nor does a mobile vegetation. If there is evidence of rupture into the pericardium, regurgitation with heart failure or obstruction these too are indications."
cardiovascular system,584,What is a characteristic findings on ECG in hyperkalaemia?,"Tall, tented T waves",Delta Waves,Shortened QT interval,Bifid P waves,Flattened T waves,A,"Hyperkalaemia leads to small pwaves, tall, tented T waves and widened QRS complexes and eventually asystole. Flattened T waves are indicative of ischaemia and Bifid P waves of left atrial hypertrophy. Delta waves are seen in WPW."
cardiovascular system,585,A 16-year-old girl was incidentally found to have delta wave on ECG suggestive of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. There was no tachycardia and she was asymptomatic. Which is the next step in management?,Beta blocker therapy,Electrophysiological study and provocation of arrhythmia,Radiofrequency catheter ablation of the bypass tract,Reassurance,Repeat ECG,D,"The electrocardiogram (ECG) appearances of a delta wave occur in approximately 1.5 per 1000 of the population, but many individuals never experience paroxysmal tachycardias. The degree of pre-excitation during sinus rhythm is variable: it may be intermittent if the refractory period of the accessory pathway is close to the sinus cycle length, or unapparent if the delta wave is obscured due to rapid AV nodal conduction. Radiofrequency catheter ablation of bypass tracts is possible in more than 90% of patients and is the treatment of choice in patients with symptomatic arrhythmias."
cardiovascular system,586,Which of the following is correct regarding abdominal aortic aneurysm?,Are more common in women,Can lead to paraplegia,Does not rupture until the diameter reaches 70 mm,Is associated with thinning of the tunica adventitia,May cause occlusion of the intercostal arteries,B,"The incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is about five times higher in men than women. It causes thinning of the tunica media and tunica intima leading to atrophy. The elastic fibres may be replaced with connective tissue material such as collgen. Mural thrombosis is common and may fill the saccular aneurysm. Abdominal aortic aneurysm may be associated with occlusion of the renal arteries or the iliac arteries which may lead to mesenteric ishaemia ('mesenteric angina'). Involvement of the vertebral arteries may lead to ischaemia of the spinal cord resulting in paraplegia. Any aneurysm more than 50 mm in diameter has the potential to rupture, and hence regular surveillance (with ultrasound scan or CT) is indicated. Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm carries a mortality in the range of 50-60%."
cardiovascular system,587,Which of the following suggests the presence of mitral regurgitation as well as mitral stenosis?,Raised JVP,Atrial fibrillation,Loud P2,Localised tapping apex beat,Displaced apex beat,E,Mitral stenosis on its own does not lead to left ventricular dilatation and does not cause a displaced apex beat. If there is a displaced apex beat this is suggestive of mixed mitral disease. The other options occur in mitral stenosis.

Defects, in order of decreasing frequency, are:  Atrioventricular septal defect Ventricular septal defect Patent ductus arteriosus Tetralogy of Fallot, and Atrial septal defect.  "
cardiovascular system,589,Where is B type natriuretic peptide secreted from?,Right atrium,Renal mesangium,Ventricles,Left atrium,Carotid body,C,BNP is released by the ventricles when there is an increase in cardiac pressures most commonly secondary to volume distension but also due to obstruction to flow.
cardiovascular system,590,"An 87-year-old woman was referred to the clinic with a two-month history of alternating constipation and diarrhoea, night sweats, and fatigue. The patient was not sure if she had lost any weight. On examination, she appeared thin and pale. Her pulse was 80/minute and regular. A systolic murmur was audible at the apex, radiating to the axilla. No diastolic murmurs were heard. Investigations revealed blood cultures to be positive, and transthoracic echocardiogram revealed a vegetation on the mitral valve. Which is the most likely causative organism in this case?",Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus bovis,Streptococcus mitis,Streptococcus viridans,C,"This patient has endocarditis. In addition to the symptoms that might be attributed to endocarditis (fatigue, night sweats), she also has a history of altered bowel habit that is very suggestive of an underlying malignancy. Streptococcus bovis is a normal commensal of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, S. bovis bacteraemia and endocarditis have a strong association with GI malignancy. Coagulase-negative staphylococcal endocarditis is exceptionally rare in native valve endocarditis, though it is the commonest cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis in the postoperative period. Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis is typically the result of a focus of staphylococcal infection (for example, skin abscess). Streptococcus mitis endocarditis and viridans streptococci (which include S. mitis) are normal commensals of the oropharynx and GI tract. Endocarditis is usually associated with poor dental hygiene; overall, Streptococcus viridans accounts for ~40% of cases of endocarditis."
cardiovascular system,591,"An 82-year-old former soldier with no prior medical history of note was admitted following appendicitis treated with laparoscopic appendicectomy a week previously. There were no immediate postoperative issues of note, with stable blood count and biochemistry. He is referred to the medical team prior to discharge to address a consistently high systolic blood pressure, ranging around 160-170 mmHg, over repeated readings during the course of the admission, with no diurnal variation. Similar readings are obtained from all four limbs, in lying and standing positions. A review of his history indicates that the patient takes over the counter analgesia as required, but has never required medical care. He is a former smoker, but gave up many years ago. He has a good diet, and walks his dog two miles a day. On clinical examination the patient is euvolaemic with an undisplaced apex, normal heart sounds and no bruits. Undilated fundoscopy is normal. Urine dipstick demonstrated a trace of ketones but nil else. The cardiac axis is normal on ECG. Biochemistry, including renal function, fasting glucose, and lipid profile, is normal. BMI is calculated at 22 kg/m^2. Which is the best strategy to manage this patient's hypertension?",24 hour urine collection to look for proteinuria,Aggressively modify lifestyle factors,Ambulatory blood pressure monitor,Avoid antihypertensives in view of the risk of falls,Offer antihypertensive therapy,E,"The hypertension in the very elderly trial (HYVET) clarified uncertainty surrounding the control of blood pressure in elderly patients, and whether its benefits outweighed the risks of side effects in an aged population. It compared diuretics, plus or minus ACE inhibitors, against placebo in patients above 80 years of age. This yielded not only a decrease in cardiovascular events, but also appreciably improved all cause mortality. The trial set a target blood pressure of 150/80 mmHg, and it is unclear at this stage whether aiming for a lower target will reap further benefits. It is also uncertain which classes of drugs are best, and in which order. Thiazides, ACE-inhibitors, and calcium channel blockers have been advocated in a stepwise fashion. In this case, the trace of ketones on urine dipstick is of no consequence as the patient has established diet and bowel habit, is euvolaemic and has recently had abdominal surgery. In the absence of a positive urine dipstick there is no need to pursue the possibility of proteinuria. This patient has little in the way of lifestyle factors to modify, being a non-smoker with frequent exercise, good diet, and normal BMI. Regular blood pressure monitoring has in effect been carried out during the week of admission, with a consistently elevated blood pressure; an ambulatory blood pressure monitor would add little. Note that in this population it is important to measure blood pressure in all four limbs, and in lying/standing positions, in view of the risks of diffuse arterial disease and orthostatic hypotension respectively. Denying this patient antihypertensives in fear of falls is inappropriate in the context of his mobility and independence. "
cardiovascular system,592,"A 29-year-old female attends the Emergency department complaining of acute onset of palpitations. She is attached to a cardiac monitor and her pulse rate is 180 bpm. She is warm and well perfused, her BP is 135/80 mmHg, respiratory rate 20/min, oxygen saturation 100% on air and on auscultation her chest is clear with no evidence of cardiac failure. ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia. Carotid massage and Valsalva manoeuvre have failed to attenuate the rhythm disturbance. What is the appropriate initial management?",DC cardioversion,IV adenosine,IV amiodarone,IV digoxin,IV magnesium,B,"This patient has a narrow complex supraventricular tachycardia. From history and examination she is not haemodynamically compromised and, therefore, initial management would be IV adenosine in the absence of contraindication (for example, asthma) in order to create a transient conduction delay. This may terminate the tachycardia, or cause a slowing in rate to allow identification of the underlying rhythm, to guide optimal antiarrhythmic therapy. If the patient had chest pain, hypotension, SBP less than90 mmHg, or evidence of cardiac failure, then DC cardioversion would be indicated."
cardiovascular system,593,Which of the following is true regarding electrocardiogram (ECG) interpretation?,0.16 seconds represents a normal QRS duration,50 mm per second is the standard paper speed,Standard calibration implies that 0.1 mV is equivalent to a deflection of 1 cm,The P-R interval is measured from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex,The Q-T interval is measured from the start of the QRS complex to the start of the T wave,D,"The standard paper speed for recording the ECG is 25 mm per second, and 1 mm corresponds to 0.04 seconds. The standard calibration of voltage deflections is: 0.1 mV equals 1 mm. The P wave represents atrial depolarisation. Atrial repolarisation occurs during the P-R interval and the QRS complex. The P-R interval is measured from the start of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex, and is normally between 0.12 and 0.2 seconds. It serves as a rough approximation of atrioventricular conduction time. The QRS complex represents ventricular depolarisation, and is normally less than 0.12 seconds. The Q-T interval is measured from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. It approximates to the ventricular refractory period and is normally 0.42 seconds. The S-T segment is measured from the end of the QRS complex to the start of the T wave. It represents the time period between ventricular depolarisation and ventricular repolarisation. The T wave is produced by ventricular repolarisation."
cardiovascular system,594,"A 22-year-old man undergoes ECHO screening for HOCM. His father died suddenly at the age of 43, and was found on post mortem to have underlying HOCM. On further questioning it transpires that there is a family history of sudden cardiovascular death. On examination his BP is measured at 142/84 mmHg. His pulse is 78 and regular. There is a double apex beat and a mid-systolic murmur. ECHO reveals a septal wall thickness of 3.3 cm. Which of the following factors is most closely linked to his 20 year risk of sudden cardiac death?",BP of 142/84 mmHg,Double apex beat,History of sudden cardiac death in paternal uncle,Intensity of his systolic murmur,Septal wall thickness of 3.3 cm,E,"Prediction of sudden cardiac death risk in hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) is notoriously difficult, but septal wall thickness greater than 3 cm is associated with a significantly increased risk. A study in the NEJM put the 20 year risk of sudden cardiac death at almost 40% for this population, even in the absence of symptoms such as angina or syncope. It is most likely that septal hypertrophy increases the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Other factors known to mark out increased risk of sudden death include documented collapse, or ventricular arrhythmias documented on Holter monitoring, both of which would prompt consideration of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

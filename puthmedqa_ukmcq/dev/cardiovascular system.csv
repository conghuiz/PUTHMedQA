cardiovascular system,1,A paper describes a new diagnostic test for myocardial infarction (MI). You want to know what proportion of patients who are classified as not having had a myocardial infarction by the test will actually not have had a myocardial infarction. Which one of the following measurements would indicate this?,Accuracy,Negative predictive value,Positive predictive value,Sensitivity,Specificity,B,"The proportion of 'true negatives' not having had a MI correctly identified by this test is called the negative predictive value and refers to the number accurately identified to not have MI by the new test over the number without MI identified by the test + those wrongly identified as not having had an MI. Specificity is the number without MI accurately identified. Sensitivity refers to the number correctly identified with MI by the new test. A positive predictive value refers to the number accurately identified with MI by the test over the number accurately identified with MI + those wrongly identified with MI. Candidates are often confused about the differences between sensitivity/specificity and positive/negative predictive values. We have had a lot of queries from candidates, asking us why the answer is negative predictive value and not specificity, since the definition of both seems to be similar. There is, however a difference and you may wish to read further into this if you are having similar difficulties. If you consider the example of a condition for which there is a test, essentially a knowledge of the sensitivity/specificity is based on the disease state itself, whereas predictive values are based on the test result.

cardiovascular system,2,A 16-year-old male presents with acute severe asthma. On examination his peripheral pulse volume fell during inspiration. Which one of the following is the most likely explanation for this clinical sign?,A falling heart rate on inspiration,Myocardial depression due to hypoxia,Peripheral vasodilatation,Reduced left atrial filling pressure on inspiration,The cardiac effect of high dose beta agonist bronchodilator drugs,D,"This patient is demonstrating pulsus paradoxus. The right heart responds directly to changes in intrathoracic pressure, while the filling of the left heart depends on the pulmonary vascular volume. At high respiratory rates, with severe air flow limitation (for example, acute asthma) there is an increased and sudden negative intrathoracic pressure on inspiration and this will enhance the normal fall in blood pressure."
cardiovascular system,3,Patient with pain and swelling in left leg and thigh up to the level of inguinal ligament. Where is the level of occlusion?,Femoro-popliteal artery,Left common iliac artery,Aortoiliac artery,Femoral artery,Profound femoral artery,B,General rule is occlusion occurs in proximal bifarcation. So the correct key is B. Left common iliac artery. That is occlusion in the bifarcation of left common iliac artery (as femoral artery bifarcates more distally to superficial and deep branches)
cardiovascular system,4,"A 48-year-old female with a three year history of type 2 diabetes presents at annual review. Despite optimisation of her oral hypoglycaemic therapy she has gained approximately 5 kg in weight over the last year and her HbA1c has deteriorated. She is also treated with ramipril, bendroflumethiazide, and amlodipine, but her blood pressure remains difficult to control with a recording of 172/102 mmHg. On examination, she has developed abdominal striae, thin skin is noticeable with bruising and she also has a proximal weakness. A diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome is suspected. Which is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",9 am ACTH concentration,9 am cortisol concentration,24 hour urine free cortisol concentration,Chest x ray,CT scan adrenals,C,"Appropriate screening tests for Cushing's syndrome include a 1 mg overnight dexamethasone suppression test (1 mg dexamethasone given at 11 pm and the cortisol measured at 9 am the following morning). Overnight dexamethasone suppression test is the preferred test, as urinary collection has lower sensitivity. A cortisol concentration less than 50 nmol/L after this test would be regarded as normal. Another equally good and easily performed test is a 24 hour urine collection measuring free cortisol in the urine. An elevated cortisol (usually above 250 nmol/day) suggests Cushing's syndrome. Random cortisol or 9 am cortisol provides no diagnostic information whatsoever. Chest x ray and adrenal CT are useful in investigating the possible cause of Cushing's syndrome."
cardiovascular system,5,"A 60 year old presents with crushing central chest pain associated with autonomic features.  An ECG shows STEMI with 2mm elevation in II, III and aVF.  What coronary artery has been affected?",Posterior Descending,Left anterior descending artery,Left Main stem,Right coronary artery,Circumflex artery,D,"This is an inferior MI and thus the RCA is likely to be the culprit as in the majority it supplies the posterior interventricular septum, posterior LV and the inferior wall."
cardiovascular system,6,A 58-year-old man with a history of schizophrenia on thioridazine is found to have episodes of torsades de pointes ventricular tachycardia (VT). His blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?,IV betablocker,IV lidocaine,IV magnesium,Overdrive pacing,Synchronised DC cardioversion,C,"Thioridazine, an antipsychotic, and many other drugs can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsade de pointes VT. Self-limiting bursts of torsade may be seen on an ECG and prompt urgent treatment. "
cardiovascular system,7,A 60-year-old lady has severe chest pain. ECG shows changes of inferior wall MI. ECG also shows progressive prolongation of PR interval until a QRS complex is dropped. What is the most probable diagnosis?,Atrial fibrillation,VT,SVT,Mobitz type I 2nd degree heart block,Mobitz type II 2nd degree heart block,D,Inferior MI is frequently associated with conduction defect
cardiovascular system,8,A 60-year-old man presents with features of left ventricular failure. He is comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity (two flights of stairs) results in fatigue and shortness of breath. Which of the following New York Heart Association's classifications best match the severity of this man's disease?,Normal,NYHA Class I,NYHA Class II,NYHA Class III,NYHA Class IV,C,"In 1928 the New York Heart Association published a classification of patients with cardiac disease based on clinical severity and prognosis. andquot;Class II. Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain.andquot; "
cardiovascular system,9,A 62 year old has had two syncopal episodes. She complains of intermittent palpitations. There is nil of note on examination and her bloods are normal. What is a useful first investigation?,Nil required,Exercise tolerance test,Echocardiogram,EEG,24 hour ECG,E,"In a patient with syncopal episodes and a normal clinical examination who is complaining of intermittent palpitations, a 24 hour ECG is a reasonable first investigation. This will exclude any cardiac arrhythmias. In some patients reassurance is appropriate if the patient is young and it is clearly syncopal and no symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease. Aortic stenosis can lead to syncope however normally a murmur would be heard. If there was concern of this an echocardiogram should be organised."
cardiovascular system,10,A 21-year-old woman has a history of palpitations and light headedness. ECG shows short PR interval and inferior Q waves. Her symptoms improve with atenolol 25 mg/day but she has had two short episodes of similar symptoms in the previous 24 hours. Which of the following is the long term management of choice?,Anticoagulation,Increase the dose of atenolol,Oral amiodarone,Oral digoxin,Radiofrequency ablation,E,"Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome can be associated with negative delta waves in II, III and aVF. The long term management of choice is ablation of the accessory pathway. Anticoagulation is not indicated in solitary WPW without AF. Incrasing the atenolol dose is only likley to gain symptomatic control temporarily.  Oral amiodarone can exacerbate Ventricular Taccycardia in WPW. Oral digoxin can lead to blockade of the AV node."
cardiovascular system,11,A 54-year-old man has recently been diagnosed with moderate depression. He has history of MI and is suffering from insomnia. What is the drug of choice for him?,Citalopram,Lofepramine,ECT,Haloperidol,Diazepam,A,"Depression is common among patients recovering from a myocardial infarction. Approximately 1 in 6 patients with MI experience major depression and at least twice as many as that have significant symptoms of depression soon after the event. Post-MI depression is an independent risk factor for increased mortality (as depression is clearly associated with poor compliance with risk-reducing recommendations). For treating this depression SSRIs are recommended as first line agent and among SSRIs Sertraline is the drug of choice for ischemic heart disease. Next choice is citalopram (as it is often related to torsades de pointes it is not 1st choice). As the patient has insomnia and citalopram can cause insomnia too, it should be taken in the morning. If SSRI cannot be used Mirtazapine is recommended as next antidepressant"
cardiovascular system,12,"A 28-year-old man presents with a 2 hours history of rapid palpitations. He feels a little light headed but is otherwise well. Examination: pulse 170 bpm and regular, BP 100/68 mmHg. He has had 2 similar episodes in the past. What is the most likely rhythm disturbance?",SVT,VF,VT,V-ectopics,A-fib,A,"Palpitation, light headedness with a tachycardia of 170bpm that is regular are most likely a SVT. Ventricular tachycardia is usually seen in patients with cardiac disease like ischemic heart disease and may frequently lead to hemodynamic instability"
cardiovascular system,13,Which of the following may be responsible for a hypokalaemic hypertension?,Bartter's syndrome,Diabetic nephropathy,Liddle's syndrome,Non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia,Type IV renal tubular acidosis (RTA),C,"Liddle's syndrome is typically associated with hypokalaemic hypertension and low renin and aldosterone concentrations - the so-called pseudo-hyperaldosteronism. Bartter's syndrome is associated with hypokalaemia, though hypertension is not a feature. In type IV RTA, there is a hyporeninaemic hypoaldosteronism, which may also be produced with diabetic nephropathy, hence hyperkalaemia is more typical. Diabetic nephropathy does not affect blood pressure or potassium levels."
cardiovascular system,14,"In a small ventricular septal defect, what would you expect to happen to oxygen saturations?",O2 saturation higher in right atrium than left atrium,O2 saturation higher in right ventricle than right atrium,O2 saturation higher in right ventricle than left ventricle,O2 saturation lower in right ventricle than right atrium,Nil,B,There is a left to right shunt between the ventricles which means the oxygenated blood from the left ventricle is mixing with the deoxygenated blood arriving into the right ventricle from the right atrium thus causing a higher oxygen saturation in the right ventricle compared to the right atrium.
cardiovascular system,15,"A 27-year-old woman complained of palpitations, breathlessness and chest pain, radiating to the left arm. These symptoms had developed six weeks previously, after she had witnessed her father dying from a myocardial infarction. In the past 10 years she had been investigated for abdominal pain, headaches, joint pains, and dyspareunia, without serious cause being found for these symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Depressive episode,Factitious disorder,Generalised anxiety disorder,Obsessive compulsive disorder,Somatisation disorder,E,"Although the brief scenario does not have quite enough criteria to fulfil a diagnosis there is enough to make somatisation disorder the most likely answer. Somatisation disorder is characterised by multiple recurring pains and gastrointestinal, sexual, and pseudo-neurologic symptoms that occur over a period of years. To meet the diagnostic criteria for somatisation disorder, the patient's physical complaints must not be intentionally induced and must result in medical attention or significant impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. By definition, the first symptoms appear in adolescence and the full criteria are met by 30 years of age. Of all the other disorders 'factitious disorder'; would seem the least likely. The other three are possible explanations but not as likely as somatisation."
cardiovascular system,16,"A middle aged male is feeling unwell after a recent MI. The recent ECG shows prolonged QRS complex and tented T wave. Na+ 136 mmol/l, K+ 6.2 mmol/l, urea 5 mmol/l. What is the most appropriate management?",Calcium gluconate,Calcium resonium,Calcium with vit D supplement,Vit D,Calcium,A,ECG change of prolonged QRS complex and tented T wave are suggestive of hyperkalaemia which is further supported by K+ level of 6.2 mmol/l. So to protect the heart from arrhythmia calcium gluconate should be given

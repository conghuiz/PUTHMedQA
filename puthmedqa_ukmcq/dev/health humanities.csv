They have looked at the previous research that has been done and not found any studies related to their topic of interest. What source should the trainee look at to check whether there are any ongoing trials for the drugs of their choice?,NHS Evidence,Medline,Cochrane CENTRAL,UKCRN Portfolio Database,RCOG Green top Guidelines,D,All the other sources provide information on trials or work that has been done in the past.UKCRN Portfolio Database and ClinicalTrials.gov give information about ongoing trials
health humanities,2,"You meet with your designated consultant to discuss your progress over the past 12 months. You discuss your progress including attainment of qualifications, an overview of work place based assessments and devise a personal development plan for the future.

Revalidation is a 5 year cycle that will typically take into account 5 appraisals and other supporting information.Learning & Assessment Summary of Learning and Assessment TermsFormative AssessmentA range of formal and informal assessment procedures conducted by educators during the learning process in order to provide feedback and modify teaching and learning activities going forward. Typically involves qualitative rather than quantitative feedback.Summative AssessmentThese typically measure the outcome of an educational outcome. Sometimes described as high stakes. Medical examples would include finals and royal college membership exams. Often described as high stakes and often require attaining for progression.Norm 
health humanities,3,"A patient with a history of pancreatic cancer complains of central abdominal pain. The patient is not constipated and his most recent blood tests were unremarkable. His GP has started him on paracetamol 1 g QDS and asks you, as the speciality doctor in palliative medicine, for advice on how in improve his pain relief. Which is the most appropriate drug choice?",Codeine 8 mg + already prescribed paracetamol,Codeine 30 mg + already prescribed paracetamol,Double dose of PCM,Oramorph,Tramadol,B,"This question requires knowledge of the WHO analgesic ladder. This underpins the management of cancer (and non-cancer) pain management and provides a stepwise management strategy to pain relief.  Step one is simple analgesia Step two uses a weak opioid plus a non-opioid.  This patient has not gained relief from step one so moving to step two (that is, codeine 30 mg plus paracetamol) is the logical next choice of those available here. Codeine 8 mg in combination with paracetamol has not been convincingly shown to offer greater analgesic benefit over paracetamol alone and is therefore not recommended (as patients can develop codeine side effects)."
health humanities,4,Guidance is provided as to what should be discussed at mentoring meetings. What should be discussed at the initial mentoring meeting?,"The expectations and objectives of the mentee, the strengths of the mentor, whether notes will be taken and an exit strategy from the mentoring relationship.",The last ARCP outcome of the trainee and strategy for achieving necessary outcomes for the coming academic year.,The clinical competencies of the mentee and plans for achieving suitable competencies.,The initial meeting should be unstructured and time be allowed just for the mentee and mentor to get to know one another.,The academic achievements of the mentee and plans for review of the ePortfolio.,A,"The expectations and objectives of the mentee, the strengths of the mentor, whether notes will be taken and also an exit strategy from the mentoring relationship, along with the needs and strengths of the mentee, frequency of the meetings and communication between meetings."

As such, forms 4 and 5 should not be completed. In spite of this, most crematoria are happy to make arrangements to cremate fetal remains. Where body parts are removed at post mortem, arrangements for cremation of these are normally made by the pathology service. "

health humanities,8,"You are currently working in the local hospice on a palliative medicine rotation. A patient is admitted from the GP with a one week history of fatigue, lethargy, itch, and constipation. On arrival he appears drowsy and weak. On further questioning of his wife, you note he has been confused at times and has no appetite. On examination he looks dehydrated with a pulse of 60. Pupils look normal sized. Respiratory rate is 16 and the rest of the examination is unremarkable. You review his letters from the oncologist and discover the underlying diagnosis is metastatic renal cell cancer. He has also been complaining of hip pain for the last eight weeks. Which is the most likely cause of this patient's deterioration?",Hypercalcaemia,Hyperglycaemia,Hypokalaemia,Morphine toxicity,Urinary tract infection,A,"Hypercalcaemia of malignancy is a palliative care emergency and should be considered in all patients presenting with acute deterioration. It occurs in approximately 10% of patients with cancer and usually in those with disseminated cancer. Typical features include altered consciousness, fatigue, general aches, dehydration, constipation, bradycardias, and other arrhythmias. Morphine toxicity is unlikely here in view of the normal sized pupils and respiratory rate. A severe urinary tract infection (with sepsis) could account for the symptoms but you would expect a tachycardia. Therefore the most likely answer to fit with the clinical features is hypercalcaemia."
health humanities,9,A 67-year-old man with a history of metastatic lung cancer complains of lateral chest wall pain. You review his notes and radiological investigations and note he has been diagnosed with lung cancer with metastatic deposits in his ribs. You take a full history and examine the patient; he complains of pain which radiates from his right lateral chest wall around to his sternum. Which of the following is the most appropriate choice of analgesia to try first in this situation?,Amitriptyline,Carbamazepine,Gabapentin,Ibuprofen and tramadol,Morphine,D,"This pain may be due to metastatic deposits within the ribs, but may also have an element of neuropathic pain.  Nerve pain often also has a nociceptive opioid responsive element and hence opioids (with a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) should be tried first and used as part of the WHO analgesic ladder. Thus, ibuprofen and tramadol are the correct answer and not morphine. Morphine would be tried next, followed by the other agents."
health humanities,10,"An admission OSCE to test ability to work as a team member is developed as part of the selection of students to medical school. Five years later the findings suggest that students who performed well in the admission OSCE scored more highly in an examination to assess team working in the clinical environment. With regards to the admission OSCE, which of the following statements is true?",The admission OSCE was a reliable tool to predict future performance,This demonstrates predictive validity,The admission OSCE does not provide useful data about test validity because it has greater fidelity to the real situation in which the test will be used,The admission OSCE will measure the team working variables that it proposes to identify,None of the above,B,Predictive validity involves testing a group of subjects for a certain construct and then comparing them with results obtained at some point in the future.
health humanities,11,What guidelines apply specifically to contraceptive advice and treatment in under 16's?,Wolff,Purvis,Gillick,Smith,Fraser,E,"The Fraser guidelines set out the advice concerning contraception to under 16s.The term Gillick arises from a Legal case where Victoria Gillick took her local health authority (West Norfolk and Wisbech Area Health Authority ) to court to stop drs giving contraceptive advice and treatment to under 16's without parental knowledge. The judge rejected the case brought by Gillick. The decision was appealed and eventually went before the house of Lords.This set the term Gillick competence where a child (16 years or younger) is able to consent to his or her own medical treatment, without the need for parental permission or knowledge.The Fraser guidelines were issued by Lord Fraser following the decision by the house of Lords to uphold The courts original decision against Gillick Fraser Guidelines The RCOG syllabus expects candidates to be 'aware of Fraser competence issues'.The terms Gillick competence and Fraser guidelines are sometimes confused as evident by the RCOGs own blueprinting grid. A child can be Gillick competent. A dr can use the Fraser guidelines as set out below to make a decision on prescribing contraceptionFraser Guidelines1. The girl (although under the age of 16 years of age) will understand the doctors advice2. The dr cannot persuade her to inform her parents or to allow the dr to inform the parents that she is seeking contraceptive advice3. She is very likely to continue having sexual intercourse with or without contraceptive treatment4. Unless she receives contraceptive advice or treatment her physical or mental health or both are likely to suffer5. Her best interests require the dr to give her contraceptive advice, treatment or both without the parental consent"

health humanities,13,"A 12 year old girl, who lives in a care home, attends the Sexual Health Clinic requesting contraception. After taking a thorough sexual history you discover that her partner is 16 years old and she does not feel they are doing anything wrong. She has asked you not to share her information with your Safe guarding team because she is afraid of getting her partner in trouble. What should you do?",Agree with her request for confidentiality but refuse to give her any contraceptives as she is under the age of consent for intercourse.,Not issue the contraceptive but involve the Safeguarding Team,Issue a contraceptive and involve the Safeguarding team,Agree with her request for confidentiality and issue the contraceptive,Inform the police immediately,C,Children under 13 are not deemed able to consent and must all be reported to the Safeguarding Team. Also a significant age gap of more than 4 years should raise alarm bells for grooming and exploitation. It is likely that intercourse will take place even if you advise against it so it is better to protect the patient from unwanted pregnancy and STI.
health humanities,14,Laparoscopy for endometriosis RT ovary was adherent with side wall because of severe endometriosis. During mobilization of ovary bleeding started and hematoma form that was increasing and you suspected that you damaged ovarian artery and the patient was consented for laparoscopy?,Take consent from next of Kin.,Proceed without consent as gestures enough.,Take parental consent,Legal order,Do laparotomy,E,"Unexpected surgery Occasionally, you may be in the position where a surgical problem arises that has not been anticipated and, as such, has not been discussed with the woman before anaesthesia. In these cases, it is the doctor's responsibility to the woman to act in good faith, in her interest. As a junior, such situations should always be referred to a senior colleague.But what happens when you are the senior colleague? In these circumstances It can be useful to discuss the case with a fellow colleague that is, a consultant, to gain a second opinion. On occasion, it would be prudent to try to find a relative or the next of kin with whom to discuss the problem. Although the agreement has no legal standing — in England, Wales and Northern IrelandNo person can give consent to medical treatment on behalf of another adult — it would certainly help your case should your decision to proceed subsequently be challenged."
health humanities,15,Which of the following statements is correct with regard to breast screening?,Early diagnosis does not change the rate of death from breast cancer,"In young patients with a BRCA mutation, mammographic screening has a low sensitivity for detecting tumours",Mammographic screening is more sensitive in patient groups with denser breast tissue,Mammographic screening is offered to all women aged 20-75 years,p53 mutation is a commonly identified in subjects with breast cancer,B,"In young patients mammograms are not particularly sensitive in detecting tumours. This is because their breast tissue is denser than in older patients. MRI and ultrasound may help to delineate breast cancer in such patients. Mammography is more sensitive in older patient groups partly because in general the breast tissue is less dense. Mammographic screening of all women between the ages of 50 and 70 years can reduce mortality from breast cancer by 25%. There is no consensus regarding the value of breast cancer screening among women who are 40- to 49-years-old. There is no evidence for routine screening below this age. The presence of a germ-line mutation of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene increases the risk of breast cancer considerably, and patients with these mutations should be offered the opportunity to receive screening at much younger than 50 years. p53 mutations are the most common genetic change identified in human neoplasia. In breast carcinoma it is associated with more aggressive disease, and worse overall survival. The frequency is, however, lower in breast carcinoma than in other solid tumours, with an overall frequency of approximately 20%. There are certain forms of breast carcinoma, for example medullary, which have a much higher frequency "
health humanities,16,A 78-year-old woman has been diagnosed with multiple myeloma. She has been suffering severe bone pain and has been having problems with constipation. She was started on increasing doses of slow release morphine. Which of the following explains the mechanism of morphine-induced constipation?,Anorexia,Dehydration,Enhanced intestinal ring contractions,Nausea,Reduced bowel secretions,C,Morphine causes constipation by enhancing intestinal ring contractions. This results in hypersegmentation which in turn impairs peristalsis. Dehydration and anorexia will also contribute but these are not the main mechanism. Hence enhanced intestinal ring contractions is the correct answer. Ninety per cent of patients taking morphine require a laxative and a stimulant is the best choice (such as senna).

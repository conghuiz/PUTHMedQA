infectious diseases,1,A 2-year-old girl is brought to the Emergency department by her parents who report she has had a sudden onset of breathing difficulty. She has no cough. On examination she has audible stridor and is drooling saliva from the mouth. She has not received any vaccinations. What is the likely causative organism?,Haemophilus influenzae,Influenza virus Type A,Legionella pneumonia,Staphlococcus aureus,Streptococcus pyogenes,A,This child is most likely to have acute epiglottitis. Croup is an alternative diagnosis however this usually presents with a cough and a longer duration of symptoms. Haemophilus influenzae infection is the usual causative organism for epiglottitis.
infectious diseases,2,A 17-year-old girl underwent emergency splenectomy after a domestic accident. Which one of the following organisms is most likely to cause life-threatening infection in the future?,Actinomycosis,Listeria monocytogenes,Salmonella enteritidis,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumoniae,E,"Following splenectomy a person is particularly at risk from capsulated organisms. The most important are:  Streptococcus pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitides.  Vaccination may be given. Other important infections with increased risk are:  Staphlococcus aureus Escherichia coli Pseudomonas aeruginosa Capnocytophaga canimorsus (from dog bites), and malaria.  By far the most common is Streptococcus pneumoniae which can cause life-threatening infection. The mortality of post splenectomy septicaemia can be up to 50%."
infectious diseases,3,"A 24-year-old Indian deck hand is admitted as an emergency following a collapse shortly after his ship docked. According to the ships' medical officer, he had been suffering from a sore throat over the past two days which diagnosed as a viral infection. He is usually fit and well and takes no regular medication. On examination, he is pyrexial (temperature 38.9°C), his BP is 100/60, and pulse 61 and regular. He has marked cervical lymphadenopathy and pharyngitis with a grey/white membrane overlying the tonsils. Investigations:    Hb 134g/l 135-180   WCC 12.3x10^9/l 6-10   PLT 182 x 10^9/l 150-400   Na 142 mmol/l 135-145   K 4.1 mmol/l 3.5-5.5   Cr 122 µmol/l 60-110   ESR 75 mm/hr less than10   CRP 190 mg/dl less than10    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Cytomegalovirus infection,Diphtheria infection,Epstein Barr Virus infection,Pertussis infection,Streptococcus pyogenes,B,"The answer is diphtheria infection. The clues here include the gentleman's ethnic background (uptake of the diphtheria vaccination is less in India than in the UK), severe pharyngitis with lymphadenopathy and the presence of a greyish pseudomembrane over the tonsillar bed. The relative bradycardia, potentially due to diphtheria exotoxin, is a further pointer to the diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is via culture of blood or tonsillar exudate, but prior to this, the patient should be treated with antibiotics (usually a macrolide or penicillin). Airway support may also be required in severe cases, and the patient should be monitored closely. CMV rarely causes isolated pharyngitis, and EBV would be less likely given the markedly raised CRP and the presence of a pseudomembrane on the tonsils. Pertussis infection is characterised by a marked cough, which is not described here. Streptococcal throat infection is a reasonable alternative diagnosis, although formation of a pseudomembrane would be unusual in this context."
infectious diseases,4,"In a patient who is aged over 50 or under 3 months of age, what is an appropriate addition to ceftriaxone for the empirical management of meningitis?",Vancomycin,Gentamicin,Amoxicillin 2g 6 hourly,Rifampicin,Amoxicillin 1g 8 hourly,C,In patients under 3 months old or those over 50 there is increased risk of the causative agent of the meningitis being listeria monocytogenes.  Thus empirically amoxicillin should be added at high dosages.
infectious diseases,5,"A 33 year old male with HIV presents unwell.  He has a cough productive of green sputum, is short of breath and is pyrexial.  He is noticed to desaturate on minimal exertion.  On examination there is a few crackles bibasally.  A chest X ray reveal perihilar bilateral diffuse infiltrates.  Which of the following should be utilised for prophylaxis to prevent the development of this infection?",Co-trimoxazole,Cefalexin,Doxycycline,Amoxicillin,Erythromycin,A,"This patient presents with a pneumonia.  The clue to the underlying diagnosis is the desaturation on exertion, chest xray findings and minimal findings on chest which are all indicative of pneumocystis jiroveci.  In patients with a CD4 count of less than 200, co trimoxazole is recommended to be commenced for prophylaxis."
infectious diseases,6,Which one of the following statements concerning T-lymphocytes is correct?,Are infected by Epstein-Barr virus in infectious mononucleosis,Are the primary host response in bacterial infection,Compose the majority of lymphocytes in plasma,Produce IgG,T cell lymphoma has a better prognosis than B cell lymphoma,C,"The primary host response to bacterial infections is dependent on mononuclear phagocytes and neutrophils. T lymphocytes are involved in cell-mediated acquired immune responses, whereas B lymphocytes are involved in humoral immunity and produce immunoglobulins. T lymphocytes compose the majority of circulating lymphocytes in plasma. Epstein-Barr virus infects B lymphocytes and squamous epithelial cells of the oropharynx. The virus can transform B cells and epithelial cells to produce Burkitt's lymphoma, a subset of Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and oral hairy leukoplakia. T cell lymphoma makes up about 10-20% of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and has a worse prognosis than B-cell lymphoma."
infectious diseases,7,A 57-year-old woman develops a blistering rash around the midriff and is diagnosed with Herpes zoster. She is treated with aciclovir. Which of the following is responsible for the activation of aciclovir?,Integrase,Polymerase,Protease,Reverse transcriptase,Thymidine kinase,E,This is a variation on the aciclovir theme. Aciclovir acts through inhibition of viral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) polymerase but it is a pro-drug and first requires phosphorylation by thymidine kinase.
infectious diseases,8,Which of the following is a cause of isolated B-cell immune deficiency?,Infection with measles,Multiple myeloma,Treatment with azathioprine,Treatment with corticosteroids,Treatment with cyclophosphamide,B,"Excessive production of myeloma paraprotein is associated with progressive reduction in normal immunoglobulin levels and impairment of immune function. Azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, corticosteroids, and measles infection all cause reversible impairment of cell-mediated immunity."
infectious diseases,9,A 35-year-old Nigerian female was assessed in an antenatal clinic. She was clinically well. Antenatal screening for syphilis revealed the following results:    Treponemal EIA total Detected   Treponemal EIA IgM Not detected   Treponemal TPPA Detected 1:160   Treponemal RPR Not detected    What is the likely diagnosis?,Acute syphilis infection,Early latent syphilis infection,Late latent syphilis infection,Non-specific reactivity,Yaws,C,"It is important that the serology is correctly interpreted and during pregnancy this lady is referred to a GU clinic for treatment with benzathine penicillin if not previously treated. The detection of treponemal EIA total is confirmed by treponemal TPPA so this result is not a false positive. As treponemal IgM is not detected this is not consistent with acute infection. In the absence of symptoms, late latent infection is more likely than early latent infection. These results are unlikely to be cross reactivity secondary to yaws."
infectious diseases,10,One of the surgical wards in your hospital notes an outbreak of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. What is the best mechanism for reducing further transmission of this infection on the ward?,Cleaning the floors and walls of the ward with chlorhexidine,Close the ward for one month,Encourage regular hand washing by ward staff,Screen ward staff using nasal swabs and exclude those with positive cultures for MRSA,Treatment of culture-positive patients with vancomycin,C,Cross-infection via hands of medical and nursing staff is a very important vehicle of transmission of MRSA. Hand washing before and after contact with patients is the single most effective measure to control hospital spread of this organism. Screening of ward staff is appropriate only in certain situations and should not be carried out unless recommended by the hospital infection control team. Vancomycin should never be used for MRSA decolonization. The hospital infection control policy should outline which patients should be screened and when decolonization should be attempted.
infectious diseases,11,A person is back packing around South East Asia and wishes malaria prophylaxis. She is very fair skinned and suffers from epilepsy. Which anti malarial would you recommend?,Proguanil,Chloroquine,Mefloquine,Atovaquone and Proguanil,Doxycycline,D,Atovaquone and Proguanil (Malarone) should be utilised in this case. Both chloroquine and mefloquine lower the seizure threshold. Doxycycline can reduce plasma concentrations of anticonvulsants and can lead to photosensitivity.
infectious diseases,12,"A 72-year-old male presents with a two-month history of poor appetite, lethargy, intermittent fever and night sweats. Four months previously he had undergone TURP for benign prostatic hypertrophy. On examination, a murmur consistent with mitral regurgitation is heard. A transthoracic echocardiogram reveals a vegetation on the mitral valve. What is the likeliest cause of his endocarditis?",C. burnetii,E. faecalis,MRSA,S. aureus,S. mutans,B,"E. faecalis is a common cause of bacterial endocarditis following a urological procedure. Urological procedures, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP), may cause a transient E. faecalis bacteraemia. In the presence of a pre-existing cardiac lesion, this may have caused infective endocarditis. C. burneti endocarditis usually occurs following contact with the infection, usually through aerosol spread.  S. mutans endocarditis is usually caused by poor dentition. S. aureus usually causes endocarditis on prosthetic valves."
infectious diseases,13,Which of the following is the drug of choice for the treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection during pregnancy?,Amoxicillin,Cephazolin,Clindamycin,Metronidazole,Tetracycline,A,"Chlamydia infection in the non-pregnant state is usually treated with a tetracycline (doxycycline 100 mg BD for 7 days), or with azithromycin 1 g in a single dose. Erythromycin and ofloxacin can be used if the first line treatments are contraindicated. During pregnancy, tetracycline therapy is contraindicated because of its incorporation into fetal bones and teeth. Treatment options are therefore erthromycin or amoxicillin or azithromycin. Only amoxicillin fits from the options listed above. "
infectious diseases,14,Which of the following viruses causes Kaposi's Sarcoma,HHV-6,HTLV-1,EBV,HHV-8,CMV,D,Kaposis sarcoma is caused by Human herpes virus - 8 (HHV-8). HHV-6 leads to roseola infantum. EBV has been associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease. HTLV-1 is associated with Adult T cell lymphoma.
infectious diseases,15,"During an outbreak of influenza A, which of the following may provide appropriate prophylaxis for an adult at risk population (including pregnant women)?",Amantadine,Ganciclovir,Lamivudine,Oseltamivir,Zidovudine,D,"Oseltamivir (Tamiflu) may be used in the prophylactic treatment of at risk patients, including pregnant women during flu epidemics. However, long term treatment does run a risk of resistance. The current protocol is as follows:  Previously healthy people (excluding pregnant women):  No antiviral treatment, or if physician feels patient is at serious risk of developing serious complications from influenza, then oseltamivir PO. At risk population, including pregnant women (but excluding the severely immunosuppressed):  Oseltamivir (PO). Treatment should be started as soon as possible, ideally within 48 hours of onset. There is evidence that treatment may reduce the risk of mortality even if started up to 5 days after onset (17). Starting treatment more than 48 hours after onset is an off-label use of oseltamivir and clinical judgement should be exercised.  For the full protocol, see the following reference. This question reference has been updated since the Covid-19 pandemic (although the answer remains the same). HM UK Government: Influenza: Treatment and prophylaxis using anti-viral agents"
infectious diseases,16,"A 49-year-old man with a long history of alcoholism presents with cough, haemoptysis and pleuritic chest pain. He has had night sweats and 10 kg weight loss in the last three months. On chest x ray there is a subtle nodular pattern throughout the lung. He underwent a transbronchial biopsy which showed multinucleated giant cells, epithelioid cells and necrotic debris. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Aspergillosis,Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP),Small cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,Tuberculosis,E,"The history, in itself, of night sweats, haemoptysis and the miliary shadowing in an alcoholic is highly suggestive of TB. The giant cells, part of granulomas would again be supportive of TB. Aspergillosis would not typically present with haemoptysis.  PCP would normally present with progressive shortness of breath and hypoxia on exertion.  Small cell and sqaumous cell carcinoma would not present with these chest x ray findings."

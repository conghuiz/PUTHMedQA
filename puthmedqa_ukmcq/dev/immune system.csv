immune system,1,Myasthenia Gravis is an example of what type of hypersensitivity reaction?,Type I,Type II,Type III,Type IV,Type V,E,"This is a type V reaction. Remember there are 2 versions of the Gell and Coombs classification. The original only has 4 types. Type V is a subtype of type 2. So if you see a Type 5 hypersensitivity condition (e.g. Graves or Myasthenia Gravis) and there is no option for type V then pick type 2! Hypersensitivity Hypersensitivity reactions have traditionally been classified into 4 types using the Gell & Coombs system. A 5th type was later added though some consider this a subtype of Type 2 reactionsType Mediators Descriptons ExamplesI IgEFast ResponseAntigens bind to IgE causing release of bioactive moleculesAnaphylaxis Allergic asthma Atopy Some allergies eg latexII IgM,IgG,ComplementIg binds to host cell antigen perceived as foreign Activates release of cytotoxic mediators e.g. MACAutoimmune haemolytic anaemias ITP Goodpasture's syndromeIII IgGIgG binds to antigens forming an immune complex The immune complex often deposits in vessel walls triggering inflammatory mediatorsSLE Rheumatoid ArthritisIV T-CellsDelayed Hypersensitivity T-cells sensitised by antigen presented by APCs Memory T-cells activated after re-exposure T-cels active macrophagesContact Dermatitis Graft Rejection Multiple Sclerosis Type 1 Diabetes type IV reaction basis for Mantoux testV IgM,IgG,ComplementInstead of antigen binding antibody binds cell surface ligands preventing cell signallingMyasthenia Gravis Graves Disease"
immune system,2,"A healthcare worker sustained a needle stick injury from a known chronic hepatitis C carrier who has not been previously treated. Assuming the healthcare worker is hepatitis C negative, which of the following is the risk of transmission?", 1/3,  1/30,1/300,1/3000,1/30000,B,"Current Public Health England guidelines state that the risk of transmission following a single percutaneous exposure from a Hepatitis C antibody positive source is between 1.2 and 3 percent. No post exposure prophylaxis is currently available. The only option is early treatment, and therefore close follow-up is warranted if the source is Hepatitis C positive. In the UK this is usually provided by the Occupational Health department, and bloods are taken at 6, 12, and 24 weeks. The serum at 6 and 12 weeks should be tested for Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, and that at 12 and 24 weeks for anti-HCV. A baseline serum should also be obtained from the exposed healthcare worker and stored for at least two years. If the healthcare worker is found to be positive for HCV, RNA or antibody to Hepatitis C should be referred to an appropriate consultant and considered for early treatment. "
immune system,3,A 70 year old male presents with back pain.  He has recently had an aortic valve replacement.  He is unwell and pyrexial and he has tenderness over L2 and restricted movement due to this back pain. His inflammatory markers are elevated.  There is no evidence of focal neurology and nil else of note on examination.  What is the most likely diagnosis?,Cauda Equina Syndrome,Lumbar disc prolapse,Infective Endocarditis,Spinal Abscess,Discitis,E,Due to the recent history of surgery and back pain the likely diagnosis is discitis.  An MRI would confirm this.  An abscess can occur but is more likely to lead to neurological symptoms.  You would expect a new murmur and no evidence of back pain on Infective Endocarditis.  There is no neurological features suggestive of disc prolapse or cauda equina.
immune system,4,"A 28 year old presents with a facial rash, joint pain and fever.  There is no evidence of active synovitis and there is a malar butterfly rash over her nose and cheeks.  Anti-ds-DNA and anti-Ro antibodies are positive.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Psoriasis,Stills Disease,Systemic lupus erythematosus,Rheumatoid arthritis,Systemic sclerosis,C,SLE is the most likely diagnosis given the history of arthritis with relatively normal joints and the malar butterfly rash.  Antibodies against dsDNA and Ro are highly indicative.
immune system,5,"A 69 year old female with a previous history of rheumatoid arthritis, currently on methotrexate, presents with painful, swelling of her right knee. She is also pyrexial and generally unwell.  What is the most likely diagnosis?",Flair of Rheumatoid Arthritis,Gout,Osteoarthritis,Pseudogout,Septic Arthritis,E,The diagnosis you should worry about in this case is a septic arthritis given the sudden onset and the fact she is generally unwell.  Methotrexate can lead to bone marrow suppression and thus lead to increased risk of infections.  Pseudogout and gout can  lead to swelling however pseudogout does not cause fever and gout is less likely due to the joint involved.  Similarly osteoarthritis does not lead to fever and malaise.  A flair of rheumatoid arthritis is obviously a possibility however the joint involved and fever and malaise mean that septic arthritis should first be suspected.
immune system,6,"A 70-year-old man complains of pain and stiffness in both his shoulders. He has lost one stone in the last eight weeks and complains of feeling lethargic with loss of appetite. Investigations revealed a very high ESR (100 mm/hr), normochromic normocytic anaemia and a positive rheumatoid factor. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Polyarteritis nodosa,Polymyalgia rheumatica,Polymyositis,Rheumatoid arthritis,SLE,B,"Polymyalgia rheumatica is an inflammatory disease which typically presents with pain and stiffness of the the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles. It can have either an acute or subacute onset and is associated with a systemic inflammatory response and therefore constitutional symptoms such as fever, anorexia, weight loss and malaise. The course of the disease is unpredictable, and 30% of patients also have giant cell arteritis. The cause is unknown, although studies showing a cyclical incidence have led to theories regarding an infectious trigger. Muscle weakness is not a feature of PMR, but this can be difficult to assess in the presence of pain. Investigations typically reveal:  Normochromic / normocytic anaemia Raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) often greater than 50 mm/hr (although this may be normal) Raised C reactive protein (CRP).  PMR is not usually associated with an elevated rheumatoid factor, but it is important to note that this is present in 1-2% of the normal population. It is not specific for rheumatoid arthritis. Features of giant cell arteritis should be sought:  Headache Visual disturbance Jaw claudication Thickened and tender temporal arteries.  Diagnosis of PMR can prove difficult, and other inflammatory conditions should be excluded. Patients are usually over 60 years, and PMR is very rarely seen in the under 50s. Response to a moderate dose of steroids can be useful. The maximum dose of prednisolone should not exceed 20 mg once daily. Patients should report 70% improvement in symptoms within three to four weeks, and inflammatory markers should have normalised by this point. In general, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories have little use and are associated with significant morbidity. There is little evidence for the use of steroid-sparing agents. Rheumatoid arthritis more commonly involves the distal joints, and there is erosive joint disease on radiography. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies are typically positive. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) rarely presents in elderly males, and there is usually more evidence of systemic disease (for example, renal impairment). Polymyositis causes proximal muscle weakness in addition to pain, and creatinine kinase is typically raised. Polyarteritis nodosa is a small vessel vasculitis which does not commonly present with isolated muscle pain and stiffness. Central and peripheral nervous system signs are often present at diagnosis.

immune system,7,Macrophages are derived from what type of white blood cell?,T-cells,Natural Killer Cells,Monocytes,B-Cells,Neutrphils,C,Macrophages are Professional APCs. They are derived from Monocytes APCs T-cells cannot detect and respond to free antigens. The antigens must first be presented by other molecules on cells. These cells are termed APCs. Most cells can 'present' antigen to a T-cell via MHC (major histocompatibility complex) type 1 molecules. These cells are sometimes termed non-professional APCs. Specialised or Professional APCs have MHC class 2 molecules in addition to type 1 and are able to stimulate CD4+ (T helper cells) and CD8+ (Cytotoxic T Cells). There are 3 types of professional APC'sDendritic Cells Macrophages B-Cells
immune system,8,"A 35 year old with a known history of rheumatoid arthritis on prednisolone and hydroxychloroquine, presents with pyrexia and a LRTI.   Bloods reveal a WCC of 7.0 with neutrophils of 6.0  and a raised CRFP and ESR.  How should you manage this patient?",Stop hydroxychloroquine,Increase prednisolone,Antibiotics,Antibiotics and increase dose of prednisolone,Nil,D,In a patient on long term steroids who has infective symptoms then steroids should be doubled and the infection treated.  DMARDs should only be stopped if there is pancytopenia.
immune system,9,You are asked to decide on administration of anti-D immunoglobulin to a 30 year old pregnant patient. A maternal blood test shows the mother to be Rhesus negative with no immune anti-D. Which of the following situations does not warrant anti-D immunoglobulin administration?,Spontaneous complete miscarriage confirmed by scan at 13 weeks gestation,Surgically managed ectopic pregnancny at 9 weeks,Painless vaginal bleeding at 10 weeks gestation that has resolved after 4 hours.,Surgically managed ectopic pregnancny at 14 weeks,Molar pregnancy confirmed at 9 weeks,C,"The BCSH guidelines state:In pregnancies Beyond 12 weeks any of the events listed below should warrant Anti-D List of potentially sensitising events:Amniocentesis, chorionic villus biopsy and cordocentesis Antepartum haemorrhage/Uterine (PV) bleeding in pregnancy External cephalic version Abdominal trauma (sharp/blunt, open/closed) Ectopic pregnancy Evacuation of molar pregnancy Intrauterine death and stillbirth In-utero therapeutic interventions (transfusion, surgery, insertion of shunts, laser) Miscarriage, threatened miscarriage Therapeutic termination of pregnancy Delivery normal, instrumental or Caesarean sectionIntra-operative cell salvageNOTEIt should be noted that the NICE guidance on Anti-D in ectopic pregnancy differs from the BCSH. Given that the RCOG are setting the exam and the archived green top guideline has been replaced by the BCSH guidance you are best being familiar with the BCSH guidance. Isoimmunisation Rhesus Isoimmunisation Key PointsRefers to immune response when a women who does not have rhesus antigens on her red cells (Rhesus negative) is exposed to red cells that have the Rhesus antigen (Rhesus positive) Occurs when father of fetus is rhesus positive resulting in the fetus having Rhesus positive blood Once sensitised the mother may develop antibodies (IgG) to the fetal blood which can cross the placenta Antibody reaction can lead to mild anaemia, haemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN ) or even fetal death Typically occurs in pregnancy subsequent to the one where the mother becomes sensitised Rho(D) immune globulin or Anti-D is a solution of IgG antibodies that can bind to any Rh positive blood that may have entered the maternal blood stream and prevent a maternal immune reaction The use of anti-D has reduced the risk of allommunisation of Rh negative mothers from 16% to less than 0.1%.Anti-D Ig Key Points from BCSH Guidelines*All RhD negative pregnant women who have not been previously sensitised should be offered routine antenatal prophylaxis with anti-D Ig (RAADP) either with a single dose regimen at around 28 weeks, or two-dose regimen given at 28 and 34 weeks Following birth, ABO and Rh D typing should be performed on cord blood and if the baby is confirmed to be D positive, all D negative, previously non-sensitised, women should be offered at least 500 IU of anti-D Ig within 72h following delivery. Maternal samples should be tested for FMH and additional dose(s) given as guided by FMH tests Following potentially sensitising events, anti-D Ig should be administered as soon as possible and always within 72h of the event. If, exceptionally, this deadline has not been met some protection may be offered if anti-D Ig is given up to 10 days after the sensitising event In pregnanciesFor potentially sensitising events between 12 and 20 weeks gestation, a minimum dose of 250 IU should be administered within 72h of the event. A test for FMH is not required For potentially sensitising events after 20 weeks gestation, a minimum anti-D Ig dose of 500 IU should be administered within 72h of the event. A test for FMH is requiredList of Potentially Sensitising EventsAmniocentesis, chorionic villus biopsy and cordocentesis APH and PV bleeding in pregnancy External cephalic version Abdominal trauma Ectopic pregnancy Evacuation of molar pregnancy Intrauterine death and stillbirth In-utero therapeutic interventions (transfusion, surgery, insertion of shunts, laser) Miscarriage, threatened miscarriage Therapeutic termination of pregnancy Delivery Intra-operative cell salvage"
immune system,10,"A 28-year-old man has developed a red, raised rash on trunk after playing football. His past medical history shows he had childhood asthma. The rash is becoming increasingly itchy. What is the most appropriate treatment?",Oral chlorpheneraime,Oral amoxicillin,IM adrenaline,Nebulized salbutamol,Histamine,A,Diagnosis is Atopy (allergy)
immune system,11,"A 45-year-old woman complains of pain in her hands precipitated by exposure to the cold weather. She has breathlessness on walking. When she is eating, she can feel food suddenly sticking to the gullet. It seems to be in the middle of the esophagus but she can’t localize exactly where it sticks. It is usually relieved with a drink of water. Choose the single most likely cause of dysphagia from the options?",Esophageal carcinoma,Systemic sclerosis,SLE,Pharyngeal carcinoma,Globus hystericus,B,"Raynouds phenomena, pulmonary involvement, oesophageal dysmotility are suggestive of systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis, also called diffuse scleroderma is an autoimmune disease of the connective tissue. It is characterized by thickening of the skin caused by accumulation of collagen, and by injuries to small arteries. Apart from skin involvement following organs are mostly affected in systemic sclerosis: the kidneys, heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.Diagnosis is by clinical suspicion, presence of autoantibodies (specifically anti-centromere and anti-scl70/anti-topoisomerase antibodies) and occasionally by biopsy"
immune system,12,Which of the following has the greatest specificity for granulomatosis with polyangiitis?,Atypical ANCA and positive antibodies to myeloperoxidase,cANCA and positive antibodies to lactoferrin,cANCA and positive antibodies to myeloperoxidase,cANCA and positive antibodies to proteinase 3 ,pANCA and positive antibodies to myeloperoxidase ,D,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are detected in two ways:  An indirect immunofluorescence assay to identify specific staining patterns. Serum samples are mixed with neutrophils to allow any autoantibodies present to react with the cells. An enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) to quantify the antibodies against the two common target antigens (myeloperoxidase and proteinase-3).  Several different staining patterns and antigen specificities are recognised:  Perinuclear (pANCA): fluorescence around the nucleus; 90% of antibodies which show this pattern are against myeloperoxidase (MPO) Cytoplasmic (cANCA): a coarse, clumpy, granular cytoplasmic staining of neturophils, which is associated with anti-proteinase-3 (PR3) antibodies in 85% of cases Atypical pANCA: patterns of neutrophil cytoplasmic and/or perinuclear fluorescence other than the two above, which occurs when neutrophil antigens other than MPO or PR3 are the antibody target. This is seen in most cases of ulcerative colitis, and some patients with Crohn's disease, drug-induced vasculitis and rheumatoid arthritis Negative ANCA: very little or no fluorescence.  If ANCA is positive, an additional test is performed to determine the titre of antibody present. A serum sample is diluted in steps and each dilution tested for the presence of the antibody. The greatest dilution at which the antibody can be detected is the titre (for example, 1:64 - serum tests remain positive after being diluted 64-fold). cANCA and specificity for the PR-3 antigen is most specific for granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Proteinase-3 is a neutral serine proteinase present in azurophil granules of human neutrophils. Antibodies against it may be present in isolation without a cANCA. In granulomatosis with polyangiitis , the level of PR3 antibody and ANCA titre are related to disease activity and the antibodies typically disappear when the disease is in remission. pANCA and/or antibody to MPO are far less specific than cANCA and can be present in a range of inflammatory conditions such as microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and Goodpasture's syndrome. MPO and pANCA may also be present in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren syndrome and occasionally in chronic infections. ANCA levels can change over time and, as such, can be used to monitor disease activity and/or response to therapy. "

What is the initial management?",OTC antihistamine,Oxygen,Bronchodilators,Epinephrine IM,Nebulized epinephrine,D,anaphylaxis with partially blocked airway
immune system,14,"A 38-year-old woman from Pakistan presents with a six week history of non-productive cough, subjective fever, chills and progressively worsening shortness of breath. She reports that recently she has been able to walk for only five to 10 minutes before having to stop and rest for breath. She has lost 2 kg over this period. There is no recent travel history or guests visiting from endemic regions. She has a 10 year diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis for which she was commenced on etanercept six months ago. Clinical examination demonstrated: temperature 38.0°C, pulse 100 regular, normal heart sounds, respiratory rate 18, mild mid zone inspiratory crepitations, SaO2 98% (pre-exertion), 89% (post exertion). Basic bloods show:    Hb 107 g/L (115-165)   MCV 88 fL (80-96)   WCC 4.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Westergren ESR 44/hr (0-20)   CRP 34 mg/L (less than10)    Chest radiography demonstrates diffuse bilateral infiltrates. Which test is most likely to be diagnostic?",Aspergillosus precipitin,Bronchoalveolar lavage,High resolution CT,Mycoplasma serology,QuantiFERON,B,"This question highlights the importance of knowing:  Potential complications of anti-TNF use in rheumatoid arthritis Clinical presentation of Pneumocystis jiroveci (PCP).  This patient has developed Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia after commencing anti-TNF therapy^1, a known risk factor. The temporal relationship, dry cough, fever, weight loss and inducible post exertional hypoxia should point you towards this diagnosis. Anti-TNF therapy also predisposes mycobacterial infection and this must be excluded before commencing treatment^2. Her radiograph and a clinical history of 2 kg weight loss in two months (insignificant value) are not consistent with this diagnosis. "
immune system,15,A 60 year old woman presents nonspecifically unwell with fever and weight loss.  She feels pain and stiffness in her shoulders and hips.  She has also noticed she has a temporal headache and she has noticed her scalp tender when brushing her hair.  Her ESR is raised.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?,Temporal arteritis,Stills Disease,Cluster Headache,Polymyositis,Migraine,A,The history and raised ESR is indicative of Giant cell arteritis with associated Polymyalgia Rheumatica.  Polymyositis can lead to proximal muscle pain and weakness however is not associated with headache.    The other options do not explain all the features.
immune system,16,"A 16-year-old girl comes to the surgery feeling under the weather. She has recently suffered from a streptococcal throat infection but feels that she has not really picked up since, although she did have a course of oral penicillin. She complains of an extensive purpuric rash which is affecting her buttocks, the back of her legs, and the ulnar side of her arms. There is also a history of abdominal and joint pains. On examination her BP is 105/70 mmHg, with a pulse of 75. She has a purpuric rash, mainly affecting her buttocks and the tops of her legs.

preventive medicine,1,"In a study of the utility of serum procalcitonin level for early diagnosis of bacteraemia, 100 consecutive febrile patients admitted to hospital were tested for serum procalcitonin and culture of bacteria. It was reported that serum procalcitonin level below 0.5 microgram/L had a negative predictive value of 95% in detecting bacteraemia. What is the meaning of this negative predictive value?",5% of the patients who do not have bacteraemia would be expected to have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 microgram/L,5% of the patients who have serum procalcitonin level below 0.5 microgram/L would be expected to have bacteraemia,95% of the patients who have bacteraemia would be expected to have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 microgram/L,95% of the patients who have serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 microgram/L would be expected to have bacteraemia,Negative predictive value will be higher if 200 patients instead of 100 patients were tested,B,"The correct answer is that 5% of the patients who have serum procalcitonin level below 0.5 microgram/L would be expected to have bacteremia. Negative predictive value is the proportion of negatively tested patients who do not have the disease. In this case, 95% of patients who have serum procalcitonin level below 0.5 microgram/L (tested negative) do not have bacteraemia and 5% have bacteraemia. The number of patients will not affect negative predictive value."
preventive medicine,2,"In a retrospective case-control study looking at lung disease, the results found that 800 of the cases and 110 of the controls were smokers. 2000 cases and 2000 controls were examined in the study. What is the odds ratio for the development of lung disease in smokers.",11.5,0.13,0.09,9,7.2,A,The odds ratio (OR)  equals (odds of smokers having lung disease)/(odds of non-smokers having lung disease). In this example OR equals (number of smokers with disease/number of smokers without disease)/(number of non-smokers with disease/number of non-smokers without disease)
preventive medicine,3,You have carried out an audit of LFT monitoring for patients on statin therapy. After the first audit cycle you identify that only 40% of patients who are taking statins have a record of monitored LFTs during the previous two years. You institute a programme to improve LFT monitoring and re-check the proportion with LFT results 18 months later. Which of the following statistical tests would be the best way to examine if the number having LFT tests has changed?,ANCOVA,ANOVA,Chi square test,Spearman's rank,t test,C,"The correct answer is the chi square test, which is the standard statistical test for comparing proportions. The method involves comparing the number observed to have LFT recorded at the second audit with the number who would be expected to have LFT recorded if the programme had made no difference. ANOVA (analysis of variance) and ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) are analyses used for statistical comparison between the means of several groups. One way analysis of variance is used when the subgroups to be compared are defined by one factor, for example, age group or sex. Two way analysis of variance is used when the subgroups are defined by two factors, for example, age and sex.The method can be extended to compare subgroups cross classified by more than two factors. The method for ANOVA is complicated but it is based on assessing how much of the overall variation in the data is attributable to differences in the group means, and comparing this with the amount attributable to differences between individuals in the same group. Hence the name analysis of variance. ANCOVA is used to investigate differences between groups when there are also continuous explanatory variables. For example, in comparing the birth weights of babies between mothers who had a Mycoplasma infection in pregnancy and those who did not, the height of the mother and the period of gestation would be called covariates. ANCOVA is closely related to multiple regression which is used to study the dependency of a variable on several explanatory variables. The t test is used to compare the means of two groups, looking for differences in means between a control and an intervention group. It is used for continuous variables like blood pressure. Spearman's rank correlation measures the degree of association between two numerical variables, and is similar to the correlation coefficient, except that it is used for non-parametric data (that is data when no assumptions can be made about the underlying distribution of the data).

preventive medicine,4,"In a study of the utility of serum procalcitonin level for early diagnosis of bacteraemia, 100 consecutive febrile patients admitted to hospital were tested for serum procalcitonin and culture of bacteria. It was reported that serum procalcitonin level above 0.5 microgram/L had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 80% and negative predictive value of 95%. Bacteraemia is thought to be more likely with increasing levels of serum procalcitonin.  Which of the following statements is correct?",The negative predictive value will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The positive predictive value will decrease if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The reliability of the sensitivity and specificity will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The sensitivity will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,The specificity will increase if the diagnostic cut-off is increased to 0.7 microgram/L,E,"If disease is more likely with increasing levels of a diagnostic marker (in this case increasing procalcitonin levels), then the specificity will increase with increasing diagnostic threshold and sensitivity will decrease. The positive and negative predictive values are more difficult to predict with changes in diagnostic threshold. But usually the positive predictive value will increase and negative predictive value will decrease with increasing threshold. The reliability of sensitivity and specificity depends on the sample size and reproducibility of the test result and does not depend on the diagnostic cut-off."
preventive medicine,5,A new publication describes a new test for cystic fibrosis. You want to know what proportion of patients with cystic fibrosis would be correctly identified by this new test. Which one of the following values would identify this?,Accuracy,Negative predictive value,Positive predictive value,Sensitivity,Specificity,D,The proportion of patients with the disease who would be identified by the new test is the sensitivity. This refers to the proportion with the disease who truly have cystic fibrosis and are identified as such by the test. Positive predictive value refers to the percent of people having a positive test who actually have the disease interpreted in conjunction to the prevalence of the disease (true positives / true positives + false positives).
preventive medicine,6,A research team believe that 5 genes can be used to predict the length of time someone will have the common cold for. 500 patients with colds are studied to measure the length of time they had their cold. How should you analyse the results?,F test,Chi square testing,Paired t test,Survival analysis,Linear regression,E,Linear regression can be used to predict the effect of each gene on the length of time that someone has a cold independently and also when genes are combined. Each gene will also have a relative strength compared to the other genes to determine which genes are the most important in affecting cold length.
preventive medicine,7,A team presented their audit of postoperative analgesia for pelvic surgery approximately one year ago from which a number of recommendations were made and changes implemented. Which one of the following options is the most appropriate next step in the audit cycle?,Identify standards,Implement change,Data collection,Re‐audit,Needs assessment,D,The audit cycle is as follows:∙ Identify problem∙ Agree on standards∙ Collect data∙ Analyse and identify area for improvement∙ Make necessary changes∙ Re‐audit.
preventive medicine,8,"The upper and lower limit of 'normal', of a biochemical test in the hospital laboratory, is two standard deviations of the population. What approximate percentage of the population is represented by two standard deviations?",85%,95%,97%,99%,99.70%,B,"If one assumes that there is a normal distribution of this test in the population, then:  one standard deviation includes approximately 68% of the population two standard deviations include approximately 95% of the population, and three standard deviations include approximately 99.7% of the population."
preventive medicine,9,A 32-year-old patient with type 1 diabetes who is on your clinic list is admitted with sudden loss of vision. You decide to examine the events which led up to this as part of a significant event audit. Which of the following is part of the process of significant event audit?,"Agreement, implementation, and monitoring of necessary changes is an essential part of the process",Events cannot be reported as part of the QAOF,"Events should not be reported to the National Patient Safety Agency, (NPSA)",Non-clinical staff should be excluded from the review process,Sudden loss of vision in a diabetic would not normally constitute a critical event,A,"As in all audits, agreement of an endorsement for change is an essential part of the process. If problems in this case with current review or scheduling of appointments for retinal photography are identified for example, then changes may be required. Events should be reported to the NPSA and may be included as part of the QAOF (quality and outcomes framework). Sudden and unexpected loss of vision in a diabetic is of course a critical incident. Whilst a patient's vision may deteriorate over time, sudden visual loss, whilst it does occur, would not be considered the norm. Non-clinical staff and their working procedures may be an underlying cause of a critical incident; as such their inclusion in the process is crucial."
preventive medicine,10,"The number of malaria cases reported during the last 10 years in a town are 250, 320, 190, 300, 5000, 100, 260, 350, 320 and 160. The epidemiologist wants to find out the average number of malaria cases reported per year in that town during the past ten years. Which of the following would be his most appropriate measure of average for these data?",Mode,Median,Geometric mean,Arithmetic mean,Standard error,B,"In the given values one of them is much higher than the others.In such cases the mean is skewed which is not so with the median, therefore the median is the most appropriate measure of the average in this situation."
preventive medicine,11,In a trial of a new drug the following results were obtained:,The numbers are too small to draw any conclusions,Pearson's co‐efficient of linear regression would be an appropriate significance test,The data could be evaluated using the chi square test,A Student's t test could be used,The results so obviously show the benefit of treatment that statistical analysis is not required,C,These data would be ideal for a chi square test. It is a 2 × 2 contingency table for which there is a special chi squared formula that gives a value that can be looked up in a table giving the p value.The Student's t test cannot be used as we are comparing proportions not means. Pearson's co‐efficient cannot be calculated as there is no linear regression to plot. Nothing is ever so obvious that no statistical analysis is needed.
preventive medicine,12,The incidence of miscarriage in clinical pregnancies in the UK,7.5 – 9.5%,1-1.2%,3.0 – 5.5%,1.5-2%,10-15%,E,"MISCARRIAGE• Occurs in 10–20% of clinical pregnancies• When these highly sensitive HCG assays are used early, the prevalence of pregnancy loss increases to about 60- 70%• About 80% of miscarriages occur in the first trimester• Incidence of ectopic pregnancy is 11.0 per 1,000 pregnanciesImpact of obstetric history• The risk of miscarriage in women in their first pregnancy or women in whom the last pregnancy ended in a live birth is5%• In multiparous women in whom all previous pregnancies have ended in a live birth, the risk of miscarriage is slightlylower (4%)• If the last pregnancy ended in miscarriage, the risk of miscarriage is 20%• If all previous pregnancies have ended in miscarriage, the risk of miscarriage is about 25%"
preventive medicine,13,Meta-analysis,Cannot be undertaken effectively without a systematic review,Should not exclude any published studies,Is a statistical method of combining data from different systematic reviews,Should not include any un-published studies,Cannot be performed if there are no randomized trials,A,"Meta-analysis & Systematic ReviewsMeta-analysis • A statistical technique for combining the findings from independent studies and is often used to assess the clinicaleffectiveness of healthcare interventions• Meta-analysis combines data from two or more randomised control trials to provide a more precise estimate oftreatment effect, giving due weight to the size of the different studies included• The validity of a meta-analysis depends on the quality of the systematic review on which it is based. The aim shouldbe to include all relevant studies, look for the presence of heterogeneity, and explore the robustness of the mainfindings.• The main requirement for a useful meta-analysis is a well-executed systematic review. If the review is unsystematic,then the meta-analysis may provide a statistical estimate that is wrong."
preventive medicine,14,"In a study of a new marker for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, 100 consecutive patients referred to the pathology department were tested for the new marker and conventional PSA tests. It was reported that the new marker above the reference range had a sensitivity of 85%, specificity of 90%, positive predictive value of 80% and negative predictive value of 95%. Which of the following is the likelihood ratio of a positive test (new marker above the reference range)?",4.8,6,8.5,16,It cannot be determined because of insufficient data,C,The likelihood ratio of a positive test = sensitivity / (1−specificity)     = 85% / (1−90%) or 0.85/ (1−0.90)     = 8.5
preventive medicine,15,A publication reports the outcome of a new statin therapy in a placebo controlled primary prevention of ischaemic heart disease in a diabetic population. 1000 patients were randomised to receive the new therapy and 1000 allocated to placebo. The study was completed over a five year period. In the placebo group there were 150 myocardial infarcts (MI) and in the group treated with the new statin there were 100 myocardial infarcts. What is the number needed to treat to prevent one MI over the course of this study?,10,20,30,40,50,B,"You treat 1000 patients for five years with the new statin and prevent 50 MIs. Thus the number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent one MI is 20 (1000/50). This statistical figure provides us with a lot of information regarding the efficacy of a treatment rather than purely statistically significant data. As it stands, you may expect to prevent an infarct by treating as few as 20 patients over five years from these data. Furthermore, cost economic data can be calculated from such results by factoring in how much the drug costs against all the costs of treating and rehabilitating a patient with an MI. "
preventive medicine,16,A trial is undertaken comparing the use of banding plus sclerotherapy versus banding plus a placebo injection for oesophageal varices. 21 from 183 procedures were unsuccessful with sclerotherapy compared to 28 from 163 procedures. What type of statistical analysis should be carried out?,Students t test,Paired t test,Unpaired t test,Chi square test,Factorial analysis,D,"The data can be fit into a 2 by 2 table and you want to test whether there is an association between success and the use of sclerotherapy, there a Chi square test is suitable."

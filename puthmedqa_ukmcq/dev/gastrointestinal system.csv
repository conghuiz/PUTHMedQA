gastrointestinal system,1,Which of the following is true of the blood supply and venous drainage of the rectum?,As the inferior mesenteric artery crosses the pelvic brim it becomes known as the anterior rectal artery,The internal venous rectal plexus is continuous with the vascular cushions of the anal canal,The middle rectal arteries are a significant contribution to the blood supply,The principal blood supply is derived from the inferior rectal artery,The superior rectal vein drains to the internal iliac vein,B,"The blood supply of the rectum is principally derived from the superior rectal artery, with contributions from the middle and inferior rectal and median sacral vessels. The lower end of the inferior mesenteric artery enters the sigmoid mesocolon and changes its name to the superior rectal artery on crossing the pelvic brim. The middle rectal arteries are frequently small or absent. The median sacral artery is also a minor contributor. The veins form communicating plexuses in the submucosa (internal rectal plexus) and the subserosa (external rectal plexus). These plexuses drain via the superior rectal vein to the portal vein and via the middle and inferior rectal veins to the internal iliac vein. The plexuses form portal-systemic anastomoses. "
gastrointestinal system,2,"A 35-year-old woman comes to the clinic for review. She has been suffering from abdominal bloating, very strongly smelling bowel gas and intermittent diarrhoea over the past two months since returning from honeymoon in Africa. On examination, her BP is 125/82 mmHg, and her temperature is 37.2°C. Her BMI is 23 kg/m^2, and her abdomen is mildly distended. Investigations show:    Hb 111 g/L (135-180)   WCC 8.1 ×10^9/L (4-10)   PLT 271 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Na 139 mmol/L (134-143)   K 4.6 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Cr 104 μmol/L (60-120)    Stool sample: Trophozoites in the fresh stool sample. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Giardiasis,Schistosomiasis,Shigellosis,Tropical sprue,Whipple's disease,A,"The history of abdominal bloating with intermittent diarrhoea and strong smelling bowel gas is typical of giardiasis. As long as a fresh stool sample is examined, trophozoites are found in 60%+ of samples. A single dose of tinidazole or a course of metronidazole is the treatment of choice. Adequate sanitation is the key to reducing the risk of infection, although the infection rate from uncooked foods is high in areas where Giardia is endemic. Schistosomiasis presents with rash as well as the above mentioned symptoms.  Shigellosis presents with blood stained diarrhoea. Tropical sprue does not have Trophozoites present in the stool sample.  Whipple's disease is caused by Tropheryma whipplei leading to GI upset and arthralgia."
gastrointestinal system,3,A 2 year old boy with Down's syndrome has chronic constipation.  His parents have recently separated.  He undergoes anorectal manometry which shows failure of relaxation of anal sphincter when a rectal balloon is inflated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Constipation,Psychological,Volvulus,Intussuception,Hirschprung's Disease,E,In Hirschsprungs disease there is absence of parasympathetic ganglion cells in myenteric and submucosal plexus of rectum.  This aganglionic section leads to obstruction as it is unable to relax.  It is thought that in 5 to 15% of those with Hirschsprung's disease also have Down's syndrome.
gastrointestinal system,4,"A 19-year-old woman returns from her gap year travels with chronic low-grade fever, intermittent abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. She has been feeling unwell for the past months and has returned to the UK because she has begun to lose weight. Her only medication is the combined oral contraceptive pill. On examination she looks pale, her BP is 110/60 mmHg, pulse is 75, and her BMI is 18 kg/m^2. Her abdomen is soft, but she does complain of some right-sided abdominal pain. Investigations show:    Hb 110 g/L (115-165)   WCC 9.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   PLT 187 ×10^9/L (150-400)   CRP 67 mg/L (less than10)   Na 139 mmol/L (135-146)   K 4.8 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Cr 120 μmol/L (79-118)    Colonoscopy reveals areas of discrete ulceration identified, punctuated by normal mucosa. The biopsy reveals transmural non-caseating granulomata. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Amoebiasis,Behçet's syndrome,Crohn's disease,Ulcerative colitis,Yersinia infection,C,"The presence of skipping and full thickness inflammation with granuloma formation is typical of Crohn's disease. Whilst an infectious agent is a possibility, it is less likely than inflammatory bowel disease here. We are not given a history of significant oral or genital ulceration, which makes Behçet's less likely. Corticosteroids and 5-ASA compounds are the mainstay of therapy for Crohn's."
gastrointestinal system,5,Early dumping syndrome is a complication of bariatric surgery. On average how long does it take to resolve?,1-2 weeks,7-12 weeks,6-8 months,1 year,3-5 years,B,"Dumping syndrome can occur in up to 50% of patients who have undergone gastric bypass when high levels of simple carbohydrates are ingested. The onset of early dumping syndrome is rapid, usually within 15 minutes of eating and results from rapid emptying of food into the small bowel. Due to the hyperosmolality of the food there are rapid fluid shifts from the plasma into the bowel leading to hypotension and a sympathetic nervous system response. The presenting symptoms are often colicky abdominal pain, diarrhoea, nausea, and tachycardia. Patients should avoid foods high in simple sugar and replace them with high fibre, complex carbohydrates and protein-rich foods. Small, frequent meals and leaving a 30 minute gap between solids and liquids are also advised. Early dumping is usually self-limiting and resolves within seven to 12 weeks. Late dumping syndrome occurs as a result of the hyperglycaemia and subsequent insulin response leading to hypoglycaemia which takes place two to three hours after a meal. Symptoms include dizziness, fatigue, sweating, and weakness. Management is similar to early dumping syndrome. "
gastrointestinal system,6,A 58-year-old woman undergoes an anterior resection for colorectal cancer. After radiological and pathological staging her disease is staged as stage III. What is the 5-year survival rate for this stage of disease?,<5%,10-20%,30-50%,55-65%,80-90%,D,The overall five year survival for Stage III colorectal cancer is around 55-65%. Five year survival for the other stages are as follows:  Stage I: 90-100% Stage II: around 80-85% Stage IV: around 6-8%.
gastrointestinal system,7,"A patient with celiac disease from birth, now as an adult presented with some abdominal symptoms. The biopsy shows infiltration of the gastric epithelium by lymphocytes. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Lymphoma,Diverticular disease,Lynch syndrome,Gastric TB,Peritoneal tumor,A,Coeliac disease leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of gut
gastrointestinal system,8,"Which of the following features, seen on barium studies, is typical of both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease?",Cobblestone mucosa,Pseudopolyps,Rose-thorn ulcers,Skip lesions,Strictures,B,Pseudopolyps are seen in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. Each of the remaining options listed tend to be features of Crohn's disease rather than of ulcerative colitis. 
gastrointestinal system,9,"A 48-year-old man presents with haematemesis and melaena. He admits to high alcohol intake. On examination he is shocked, his heart rate is 110 beats per minute and blood pressure is 92/74 mmHg. There is evidence of leukonychia and abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the epigastrium. What is the most likely underlying cause of the gastrointestinal haemorrhage?",Gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE),Gastro-oesophageal varices,Mallory-Weiss tear,Peptic ulceration,Portal hypertensive gastropathy,D,"Peptic ulceration is the commonest cause of acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) haemorrhage. Epigastric tenderness also points towards peptic ulcer disease. The history of high alcohol intake can be misleading in directing the candidate towards varices. In this case the answer is the most common cause of an acute upper GI bleed which is peptic ulceration: 25-50% of cases of non-variceal upper GI bleeding and 5% of cases of upper GI haemorrhage are due to varices. Gastric antral vascular ectasia is a relatively uncommon condition. It typically presents as a cause of iron-deficiency anaemia as a result of chronic GI blood loss. Overt symptoms of upper GI haemorrhage may be precipitated by administration of anti-platelet agents or anti-coagulants. The mean age of diagnosis is around 70 and there is an association with scleroderma. Portal hypertensive gastropathy is a poorly understood complication of portal hypertension (usually as a result of chronic liver disease). There is a typical mosaic or snakeskin like appearance to the gastric mucosa which, with increasing severity of the condition, can develop vascular ectasia and become very friable. Typical presentation is with chronic GI blood loss but acute haemorrhage may occur. "
gastrointestinal system,10,You review an 84-year-old lady in the gastroenterology clinic. She has been referred by her GP with a three month history of change in bowel habit and weight loss. Recently she has noticed PR bleeding with blood in the stool. There is a history of ischaemic heart disease with a previous myocardial infarction three years ago. She suffers from stable angina and congestive cardiac failure. Which of the following investigations would be most appropriate to make the diagnosis?,Barium enema,Colonoscopy,CT abdomen,CT colonography,Flexible sigmoidoscopy,E,"Colorectal carcinoma needs to be excluded in this case. This is the third most common cancer in the UK, after breast and lung. Three quarters of cases occur in people aged over 65 years. Around 50% survive for over five years following diagnosis, but it remains the second most common cause of cancer death in the UK. The UK now has a national screening programme for those over 60 years, which uses faecal occult blood testing. With regard to the investigation of colorectal carcinoma, colonoscopy should be offered to patients without major co-morbidity. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected, a biopsy should be performed to obtain a histological diagnosis. If the colonoscopy is incomplete, it should be repeated, or CT colongraphy or barium enema should be performed. Flexible sigmoidoscopy then barium enema should be offered for patients with major co-morbidity. CT colonography is an alternative if the local radiology service is competent in this technique. A small dose of oral contrast is administered 24 hours prior to the procedure and then the colon is imaged using helical CT scanning. Most CT colonography protocols require the use of bowel cleansing agents. The advantages over colonoscopy include no requirement for sedation, smaller risk of perforation, and extra-colonic pathology can also be demonstrated. If a lesion suspicious of cancer is detected on CT colonography, a colonoscopy and biopsy should be offered (unless there are absolute contraindications). CT chest, abdomen, pelvis should be offered after the diagnosis is made to estimate the state of the disease. Patients with a rectal tumour should also undergo MRI to assess local disease. Endorectal ultrasound can then be offered if MRI shows disease amenable to local excision (or if MRI is contraindicated). Digital rectal examination is not part of the staging investigations. In this case, the presence of congestive cardiac failure is a major co-morbidity. A flexible sigmoidoscopy should therefore be first line (especially as she complains of fresh red bleeding, increasing the chance that this is a left-sided lesion). This would allow biopsy if a lesion is seen. If the flexible sigmoidoscopy is normal, a barium enema or CT colonography would be done. "
gastrointestinal system,11,Congenital pyloric stenosis is typically associated with which one of the following?,Bile stained projectile vomiting,Diarrhoea,Hypochloraemic hypokalaemic alkalosis,Intrauterine growth retardation,Slow feeding,C,"Pyloric stenosis is a congenital abnormality resulting in hypertrophic obstruction of the antrum of the stomach. Symptoms develop in the second or third week of life, and features include projectile, non-bilious vomiting. Babies with pyloric stenosis develop weight loss and wasting with the facial appearances of fretful old men. They feed very hungrily. This results in electrolyte disturbance, namely:  Hypokalaemia Hyponatraemia Profound hypochloraemic metabolic alkalosis."
gastrointestinal system,12,Which of the following statements regarding lactose intolerance is correct?,Lactose intolerance is best diagnosed with a methane breath test,Lactose intolerance is commonest in white Northern Europeans,Lactose intolerance is treated by glucose and galactose replacement therapy,Lactose is degraded to glucose and fructose by lactase,Rotavirus infection may precipitate the diagnosis of lactose intolerance,E,"Lactase acts on lactose to generate glucose and galactose. Lactose intolerance is least common in white northern Europeans and is more common in Asian, and East Asian races. Lactose intolerance may be diagnosed with a DNA assay of the lactase gene along with a hydrogen breath test. Any GI infection may reveal lactose intolerance as gut flora may be altered by large bowel bacterial or viral load, as well as the treatment of infection. A change from an Eastern to a Western high lactose diet may also reveal lactose intolerance. Many patients labelled as having IBS may suffer from undiagnosed lactose intolerance and many medications use lactose as a binding and stabilising agent.Comlications include malnutrition which can lead to osteoporosis. Treatment of lactose intolerance is with careful replacement of lactase. REFERENCE: NHS:Lactose intolerance"
gastrointestinal system,13,"For patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, with severe intractable pruritus, which has failed to respond to colestyramine and rifampicin, what is ideally the next course of action?",Methotrexate,Steroids,Liver transplantation,High dose ursodeoxycholic acid,Plasmapheresis,C,For those who have failed to respond to medical management then the only definitive cure for the treatment of severe intractable pruritus is liver transplantation.
gastrointestinal system,14,Which of the following is correct concerning Hirschsprung's disease?,Causes functional bowel obstruction due to stricturing,Is associated with Down syndrome,Is commoner in girls,Is not associated with enterocolitis,Usually involves the entire colon,B,"Hirschsprung's disease is due to the absence of ganglion cells in the Auerbach's and Meissner's plexuses in the bowel. It is commoner in males (4:1 ratio) and 9% of Hirschsprung's cases also have Down syndrome. Hirschsprung's disease frequently presents with delayed (more than 48 hours) passage of meconium and constipation, and less commonly with enterocolitis. Rectosigmoid involvement predominates, but ganglia are sometimes absent throughout the entire colon."
gastrointestinal system,15,Which of the following is correct regarding anastomotic leakage?,In colorectal surgery it results in a threefold increase in post-operative mortality,It is reduced by excessive tension in the ligatures,It is reduced if the anastomosis is formed below the peritoneal reflection,Leakage detected by clinical means is roughly equal to radiologically detected leaks,The investigation of choice to confirm the diagnosis is barium enema,A,Most colorectal anastomotic leaks present late (after the patient has recommenced oral feeding). Low anastomoses have a higher leak rate therefore most surgeons divert the faecal flow with a temporary proximal stoma. The clinical leak rate underestimates the true incidence of leakage. Excessive tension leads to tissue necrosis and leakage of the anastomosis. Barium is toxic in the peritoneal cavity therefore the investigation of choice is a gastrograffin enema.
gastrointestinal system,16,"A 48-year-old woman complains of pruritus, steatorrhoea, and bruising. On examination, she is jaundiced and pigmented, with spider naevi and hepatosplenomegaly. Which is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",Alcoholic liver disease,Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency,Autoimmune hepatitis,Primary biliary cirrhosis,Wilson's disease,D,"This woman has clinical evidence of chronic liver disease and portal hypertension. The two main conditions causing pigmentation and chronic liver disease are primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and haemochromatosis. PBC is a chronic cholestatic inflammatory liver disease, the aetiology of which is probably autoimmune. It most commonly affects middle-aged women. There is jaundice with skin pigmentation, risk of developing oesophageal varices, and fat malabsorption leading to deficiency of the vitamins A, D, E, K (hence osteomalacia and also bruising). Serum antimitochondrial antibody is positive in 95-99% cases."

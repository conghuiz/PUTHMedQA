others,1,"A 32-year-old patient is involved in a severe road traffic collision. On arrival in a district general hospital Emergency Department, he has a GCS of 3 and is intubated. He is taken to the CT scanner, where a right-sided subdural and a left-sided extradural haematoma plus multiple contusions are noted. The regional neurosurgery unit are contacted but no surgical intervention is advised and he is placed in the ITU. A few days later, his condition on ventilator has not improved and he is assessed for brainstem death. Which of the following is a criterion for the diagnosis of brainstem death?",Core temperature of less than 36°C for greater than 8 hours,Glasgow coma score of 3 for over 24 hours,No response to adrenaline injection,No spontaneous ventilatory effort (when mechanical ventilation withdrawn),Pulse of greater than 120/minute for over 1 hour,D,Brain stem death is diagnosed when the patient is deeply unconscious (GCS of 3) due to a known and irreversible structural injury. There must be absence of brain stem reflexes:  Fixed and non-reactive pupils Absent corneal reflexes Absent oculo-vestibular reflex Absent pharangeal (gag) reflex Absent tracheal (cough) reflex Absence of respose to pain No spontaneous ventilatory effort when mechanical ventilation is withdrawn for 5 minutes (with O2 at 5l/min via endotracheal cannula; PaCO2 greater than6.0 KPa and pH less than7.4)  The withdrawal of mechanical ventilation should be the last test after all the others have shown no evidence of brain stem reflexes. The patient should have normal physiological parameters and not have any current or residual medication which could mimic brainstem death. The diagnosis implies that there will be no recovery of normal brain function. 
others,2,"A 29 year old female presents to her GP. She has noticed dandruff and a rash on her face. On examination there is evidence of areas of erythema with fine scaling over her nasal bridge, around her nasolabial fold and eyebrows and ears and there is evidence of fine scaling on the scalp. Given the most likely diagnosis, which of the following organisms may be associated?",Malassezia,Demodex mites,Nil,Propionibacterium acnes,Candida Albicans,A,The clinical features described are characteristic of Seborrhoeic dermatitis. It is thought to be caused by an inflammatory reaction to the yeast Malassezia. Typically the face and scalps is affected as described here however other areas which can be involved include the sternum and upper back and the skin flexures. Treatment includes topical ketoconazole including shampoo and topical steroids intermittently. More severe disease may be treated with oral antifungals and UV light treatment.
others,3,"A 25-year-old female presents with progressive visual loss in her left eye. She states that it started as some blurring, followed by distortion of central vision, and now has some degree of visual loss in all fields. She states that her mother and brother also had a similar problem at her age which was never diagnosed formally though her father does not suffer from anything similar. A slit lamp exam shows optic atrophy Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Lebers Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON),Kearns Sayers disease,"Mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke syndrome (MELAS)",Multiple Sclerosis,Myoclonic Epilepsy with Red Ragged Fibers (MERFF),A,"The question is alluding to a mitochondrial inherited disease and therefore MS is ruled out. Kearns Sayers is a mitochondrial disorder which usually presents before the age of 20 and is associated with red ragged fibers on muscle biopsy. It will present with Retinitis Pigmentosa, not optic atrophy.  MELAS syndrome normally affects people early in childhood with neuromuscular and developmental symptoms. MERFF syndrome is extremely rare and presents with night blindness, visual loss, and hearing problems. The condition described above is that of LHON, a mitochondrial disorder associate with optic atrophy with signs of central visual loss. The visual loss usually affects one eye but can affect both.

others,4,A 25-year-old female presents with concerns regarding the unsightly appearance of her toe nails. They have a whitish discolouration extending up the nail bed in a number of the toes of both feet and a dermatophyte infection is confirmed. She has been cutting her nails carefully and applying topical amorolifine to no avail. What is the most appropriate treatment?,Oral fluconazole,Oral terbinafine,Topical benzoic acid,Topical fluconazole,Topical terbinafine,B,"You should offer treatment with an oral antifungal agent if an adult has confirmed fungal nail infection and self-care measures alone and/or topical treatment are not successful or appropriate. Terbinafine is recommended first line because it is effective against both dermatophytes and Candida species, whereas the '-azoles' (e.g. fluconazole) do not have as much efficacy against dermatophytes. "
others,5,"A 29 year old female presents to her GP. She has noticed dandruff and a rash on her face. On examination there is evidence of areas of erythema with fine scaling over her nasal bridge, around her nasolabial fold and eyebrows and ears and there is evidence of fine scaling on the scalp. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?",Topical steroids,PUVA,Oral Steroids,Topical Ketoconazole,Oral Fluconazole,D,The clinical features described are characteristic of Seborrhoeic dermatitis. It is thought to be caused by an inflammatory reaction to the yeast Malassezia. Typically the face and scalps is affected as described here however other areas which can be involved include the sternum and upper back and the skin flexures. Treatment includes topical ketoconazole including shampoo and topical steroids intermittently. More severe disease may be treated with oral antifungals and UV light treatment.
others,6,"A 31 year old female presents with gradual blurring of vision in her left eye over the prior 3 weeks. The visual acuity is reduced in both eyes, the left pupil has a delayed response and the consensual pupillary reaction in the right eye is sluggish. Fundoscopy reveals a normal optic disc. What is the likely diagnosis?",Cerebral tumour,Ischaemic optic neuropathy,Retrobulbar neuritis,Central retinal artery occlusion,Glaucoma,C,"This is retrobulbar neuritis of the optic nerve. The classic symptoms are loss of vision, pain on eye movement and loss of colour vision, particularly red, in the affected eye. The optic disc is swollen in only one third of cases, so retrobulbar inflammation (between the brain and eye) is the most common presentation."
others,7,A 25-year-old female presents with red crusted lesions around the mouth and finger pulps three months after having had small bowel resection for Crohn's disease. Which is the most likely cause of her skin condition?,Nicotinamide deficiency,Pyridoxine deficiency,Thiamine deficiency,Vitamin B12 deficiency,Zinc deficiency,E,"Zinc deficiency can lead to acrodermatitis which presents with perioral dermatitis, acral involvement, and sometimes alopecia. The features of this patient who had bowel resection suggest zinc deficiency."
others,8,A 28-year-old woman with history of drug addiction wants to start a family and have a baby. She would like to stop taking heroin and asked for something to help her stay away from it. What drug treatment would you give her?,Naloxone,Acamprosate,Methadone,Chlordiazepoxide,Naltrexone,C,Methadone is a powerful synthetic analgesic drug which is similar to morphine in its effects but less sedative and is used as a substitute drug in the treatment of morphine and heroin addiction
others,9,"A 25-year-old lady with SLE (ANA positive, 1:1280), had a healthy term baby boy. At the time of birth he was noted to have macular erythematous rash on his face, and trunk. He is otherwise well. Which of the following is the most likely cause of his rash?",Discoid lupus erythematosus,Erythema toxicum,Neonatal lupus,Staphylococcus aureus,Systemic lupus erythematosus,C,"This child has neonatal lupus. Neonatal lupus is an uncommon condition associated with the transplacental passage of maternal anti-Ro and/or anti-La autoantibodies. Findings may include:  cutaneous lupus lesions third-degree heart block cardiomyopathy hepatobiliary disease, and cytopenias.  Typically, only one organ is affected in each infant. The most severe manifestation is the heart block, which usually begins during the second trimester of pregnancy. It is rare, occurring in only 2% of mothers with anti-Ro or anti-La antibodies. Once established, this is permanent, unlike the other manifestations which are generally transient. The rash is most frequently seen around the eyes, but also occurs in other parts of the body. Lupus presents as erythematous macular rash, on face or trunk, which may be photosensitive. Asymptomatic elevation of liver function tests is seen in 10-25% of cases. Overall, non-cardiac involvement is more common than cardiac. A significant number of babies with neonatal lupus are born to mothers who are not known to have systemic lupus erythematosus. Systemic lupus erythematosus does not occur in neonates. Discoid lupus erythematosus presents with ulcers which heal with scarring. The rash in erythema toxicum is papular, small, yellow-to-white coloured, and surrounded by red skin. This rash changes rapidly, appearing and disappearing in different areas over hours to days. Staphylococcus aureus can cause impetigo and scalded skin syndrome, but these are not commonly seen in the immediate neonatal period. "
others,10,A 32 year old gentleman has been undergoing topical treatment for psoriasis for some time. He presents as he has noticed patches of skin which appear thin and lax and which are hypopigmented and shiny with prominent blood vessels. What is the most likely cause of this?,Topical tar based cream,Topical vitamin A analogue,Advanced psoriatic plaques,Dithranol,Topical steroid use,E,"The lesions described are typical of skin atrophy secondary to repeated topical steroid use. Dithranol is more difficult to use and is often only applied in a hospital setting. Dithranol, topical vitamin A and tar based creams can be irritant but do not lead to atrophy."
others,11,"A 28-year-old female presents eight weeks post-partum with a painful, swollen, erythematous right breast. On examination there is fluctuance in the right upper outer quadrant adjacent to nipple areolar complex. The overlying skin is red and tender. What is the most appropriate management for this patient?",Excision of abscess cavity,Incision and drainage,Intravenous antibiotics,Mammograghic guided needle aspiration,Ultrasound guided needle aspiration,E,"Post-partum breast abscess occurs in breastfeeding mothers. They usually result from Staphylococcus aureus introduced through cracks in the nipple-areolar complex and are usually situate peripherally. Infection may also result at weaning due to engorgement of the breast or from the child developing teeth. Early breast infections (that is, before pus forms) may be treated successfully with antibiotics. When pus forms the treatment is ultrasound guided needle aspiration (mammography requires compression of the painful breast between radiographic plates and is therefore contraindicated). Surgical incision and drainage may result in a mammory-cutaneous fistula and is only indicated if the abscess is very loculated, fails to respond to repeated guided aspirations or if the overlying skin is necrotic. "
others,12,"A 31-year-old female presents with red scaly plaques on her cheeks, forehead, and sides of the neck. On close inspection of the lesions, there was plugging of some hair follicles with keratin and atrophy of the skin. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",Atopic eczema,Discoid lupus erythematosus,Polymorphic light eruption,Porphyria cutanea tarda,Psoriasis,B,"This woman has discoid lupus erythematosus. Lesions are discrete plaques, often erythematous, covered by scales that extend into dilated hair follicles. These lesions most typically occur on the face, scalp, in the pinnae, behind the ears, and on the neck. They can exist in areas not exposed to the sun. The lesions can progress, with active indurated erythema, at the periphery. Central atrophic scarring is characteristic. Without treatment, lesions can cause permanent scarring and alopecia. Patients with widespread disease are at increased risk of developing systemic lupus erythematosus and should be closely followed up. Fluocinonide cream, hydrocortisone, and acitretin are topical treatment options. In eczema, dryness and lichenification are predominant features. Psoriasis commonly appears as inflamed lesions covered with a silvery white scale. Polymorphic light eruption is characterised by recurrent, abnormal, delayed reactions to sunlight, ranging from erythematous papules, papulovesicles, and plaques to erythema multiforme-like lesions on sunlight-exposed surfaces. Porphyria cutanea tarda is either primary or secondary uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase deficiency. The commonest symptoms are cutaneous fragility and blistering of sun-exposed skin. There may also be urine discolouration. "
others,13,"A 25-year-old male is involved in a high speed road traffic accident and after extraction from his car is brought to the Emergency Department. On initial primary survey, he is triple immobilised. He is making slightly confused conversation. Initial observations reveal a tachycardia of 120 bpm, and a systolic blood pressure of 90 mmHg. He has a respiratory rate of 30 and his chest is dull to air entry on the right hand side. He is tender over his right upper quadrant on abdominal examination. How much of his circulating blood volume is he likely to have lost?",Nil,Up to 15%,15% to 30%,30% to 40%,Greater than 40%,D,"The most common cause of shock in the trauma patient is haemorrhage. The patient has decreased blood pressure and a tachycardia which means that he is in at least class III shock, signifying a blood loss of 1500 to 2000 ml, or approximately 30 to 40% of circulating blood volume. "
others,14,"A 28-year-old Lebanese lady developed left branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO) one week after an uneventful elective caesarean section. She also developed some mouth and vulval ulcers two weeks postpartum. Visual acuity in the affected left eye was counting fingers. Full blood picture, Uandamp;Es and coagulation screen were all within normal limits. CRP was 28. Anti-nuclear antibody, ANA titre was 1:20. What is the most likely cause of her left BRAO?",Amniotic fluid embolus,Behçet's disease,Fat embolus,Reactive arthritis,SLE,B,"This lady with thrombosis and oro-genital ulceration has Behçet's syndrome. Behçet's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis with an unknown aetiology, which affects small and large vessels (venous and arterial). More than 60% of patients are HLA-B51, and there is a increased prevalence in the Mediterranean countries. It is commonly associated with mucocutaneous manifestations (oro-genital ulceration, erythema nodosum), ocular disease, gastrointestinal involvement and neurological features. Venous thrombosis is a common complication, but arterial occlusion can also occur. The International Study Group criteria for classification of Behcet's disease requires the presence of recurrent oral ulceration (minor aphthous, major aphthous or herpetiform ulceration observed by physician or patient, which have recurred at least three times in a 12 month period), and two of the following:  Recurrent genital ulceration: aphthous ulceration or scarring, observed by physician or patient Eye lesions: anterior uveitis, posterior uveitis, or cells in vitreous on slit lamp examination; or retinal vasculitis observed by ophthalmologist Skin lesions: erythema nodosum observed by physician or patient, pseudofolliculitis or papulopustular lesions; or acneiform nodules observed by the physician in post-adolescent patients not on corticosteroid treatment Positive pathergy test: read by physician at 24-48 hours.  Pathergy is the non-specific hyper-reactivity of the skin following minor trauma, and is specific to Behcet's disease. It involves intradermal injection of skin with a 20-gauge needle under sterile conditions. It is considered positive if an erythematous sterile papule develops within 48 hours. Recurrent oral ulcers occur in SLE but genital ulcers are less common. Additional features are usually present in this condition. Reactive arthritis is not typically associated with thrombosis. Amniotic fluid embolism presents with rapid cardiovascular collapse, acute left ventricular failure with pulmonary oedema, disseminated intravascular coagulation and neurological impairment. Fat embolism usually presents following long bone fracture, and causes an acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with fever, petechial rash and neurological impairment. "
others,15,"A 29 year old female presents to her GP. She has noticed dandruff and a rash on her face. On examination there is evidence of areas of erythema with fine scaling over her nasal bridge, around her nasolabial fold and eyebrows and ears and there is evidence of fine scaling on the scalp. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Eczema,Seborrhoeic Dermatitis,Psosriasis,Rosacea,Pityriasis Capitis,B,The clinical features described are characteristic of Seborrhoeic dermatitis. It is thought to be caused by an inflammatory reaction to the yeast Malassezia. Typically the face and scalps is affected as described here however other areas which can be involved include the sternum and upper back and the skin flexures. Treatment includes topical ketoconazole including shampoo and topical steroids intermittently. More severe disease may be treated with oral antifungals and UV light treatment.
others,16,"A 31-year-old woman comes to the dermatology clinic complaining that a mole on her forearm has changed shape, enlarging to nearly three quarters of a centimetre in diameter, and although it was previously homogeneous in colour, parts of it have now become a very dark black. She has no significant past medical history but admits to significant use of tanning beds and having spent a few years living in California. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 130 g/L (135-180)   White cell count 5.4 ×10^9/L (4-10)   Platelets 200 ×10^9/L (150-400)   ESR 11 mm/hr (1-20)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (134-143)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 110 μmol/L (60-120)    Excision biopsy: 5 mm thick lesion, no ulceration. Which of the following features is most associated with a poor prognosis in this patient?",Depth of the melanoma lesion,Female sex,Her age,Lack of ulceration,Significant exposure to sun beds,A,"Survival is strongly correlated with depth of melanoma at the point of diagnosis, with lesions over 4 mm thick being associated with a particularly poor outcome. Other predictors of a poor outcome include increasing age and male sex. Ulceration of the lesion also implies greater risk of metastases. For lesions over 4 mm thick with ulceration, five year survival is less than 50%. This is known as Clark and Breslow staging.  "

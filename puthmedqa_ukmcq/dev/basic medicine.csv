basic medicine,1,Which of the following does not predispose to atherosclerosis?,Hormone replacement therapy,Obesity,Diabetes mellitus,Systemic arterial hypertension,Cigarette smoking,B,"The following are proatherogenic:∙ hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia∙ hypertension∙ diabetes, and∙ smoking.The recent WHI study that analysed cardiovascular risk associated with female hormone replacement therapy (HRT) revealed, to most people's surprise, a small but significant increased cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal females.Obesity per se does not cause atherosclerosis."
basic medicine,2,Prolonged prothrombin time is indicative of abnormalities in which clotting function?,Abnormalities in the extrinsic pathway,Abnormal platelet function,Abnormalities in the intrinsic or common pathway,Abnormalities in the intrinsic pathway,Abnormalities in the extrinsic or common pathway,E,COAGULATION STUDIES∙ BLEEDING TIME - measures platelet plug formation - 3-10 minutes∙ Blood for coagulation tests is collected into citrate to prevent clotting∙ PROTHROMBIN TIME - prolonged with abnormalities in the extrinsic or common pathways∙ PARTIAL THROMBOPLASTIN TIME WITH KAOLIN - PTTK - prolonged with abnormalities in the intrinsicor common pathways∙ THROMBIN TIME - prolonged with fibrinogen deficiency or the presence of inhibitors such as heparin orfibrin degradation products
basic medicine,3,Which of the following is true regarding animal bites?,Osteomyelitis is rare,Pasteurella multocida infection is the most common organism found in cat bites,Rabies transmission occurs in the United Kingdom,Staphylococcus aureus infection is the most common organism isolated in dog bites,Dog bites are more likely to become infected than cat bites,B,"Eighty percent of mammalian bites are due to dogs. The majority follow provocation of the dog, and affect the hand. Crush injuries may accompany dog bites. Cats' teeth are sharper, so they may penetrate joints and bones. Osteomyelitis may occur from penetrating hand wounds or crush injury. Up to 20% of dog bites and 80% of cat bites become infected. One study found a median of five bacterial isolates, with 56% involving both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Pasteurella species are the most commonly identified organism, canis in dog bites and multocida in cat bites. Other commonly identified organisms are Streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Neisseria sp. and Bacteroides sp. One rare but important organism is Capnocytophaga canimorsus. If septicaemia occurs with this infection, then mortality is as high as 25-30%. Potential complications include:  Osteomyelitis Septic arthritis Abscesses, and Bacterial tenosynovitis.  Immuno-compromised patients may develop bacteraemia and meningitis. Cosmetic and functional damage may be severe. Psychological fear may persist long term. Rabies from a dog bite has not occurred in the UK since 1906. Since 1946, there have been 24 cases, all contracted abroad (usually in the Indian sub-continent). However, in 2002 a licensed bat handler died of European bat Lyssavirus 2, a rabies-like virus."
basic medicine,4,Which of the following is true of the left phrenic nerve?,Carries sensory afferents from the stomach and duodenum,Is anterior to the termination of the thoracic duct,Is medial to the internal jugular vein,Is posterior to the prevertebral fascia,Runs deep to the left scalenus anterior muscle,D,"The left phrenic nerve passes inferiorly down the neck to the lateral border of scalenus anterior. It passes medially across the border of scalenus anterior, parallel to the internal jugular vein which lies inferomedially. At this point it is deep to the prevertebral fascia, the transverse cervical artery and the suprascapular artery. It descends between the left subclavian and the left common carotid arteries, and crosses the left surface of the arch of the aorta. It then courses along the pericardium, superficial to the left auricle and left ventricle, piercing the diaphragm just to the left of the pericardium. It carries sensory fibres from the pleura, pericardium and a small part of the peritoneum."
basic medicine,5,Which one of the following options best describes the relationship between the intermediate lobe of the pituitary gland and the level of melanocyte‐stimulating hormone in pregnancy?,The volume of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary increases during pregnancy which correlates with higher melanocyte‐stimulating hormone levels,The volume of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary decreases during pregnancy which correlates with higher melanocyte‐stimulating hormone levels,The volume of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary increases during pregnancy which correlates with lower melanocyte‐stimulating hormone levels,The volume of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary decreases during pregnancy which correlates with lower melanocyte‐stimulating hormone levels,There is no change in the volume of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary or melanocyte‐ stimulating hormone levels,A,"The volume of the intermediate lobe of the pituitary increases during pregnancy.This correlates with higher melanocyte‐stimulating hormone levels which increase starting in the first trimester.Hyperpigmentation (linea nigra, chloasma) which is normally present in most pregnant women, is linked to increased melanocyte‐stimulating hormone levels."
basic medicine,6,"A 24-year-old man presents to the clinic with his wife. They are keen to start a family, but are concerned because his brother suffers from hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) and has suffered a number of upper GI haemorrhages over the past few years. Indeed, his father died of a large GI haemorrhage. He has suffered no bleeding episodes over the past few years and has no skin vascular abnormalities. On examination his blood pressure is normal at 125/72 mmHg, and there are no skin abnormalities. Physical examination is entirely normal. Which of the following is the approximate percentage chance of a male child of this couple inheriting HHT?",0%,25%,50%,66%,100%,A,"HHT carries an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Around 90% of patients with the disease are diagnosed by age 16, often because of a problem with nose bleeds. As such this man is extremely unlikely to have the condition, and as his wife is unaffected the chances of a child, male or female, suffering from the disorder is 0%."
basic medicine,7,Regarding the change in blood volume during pregnancy which of the following statements is TRUE?,Blood volume slowly increases by 40-50%,Blood volume increases by approximately 20-25%,Blood volume increases by approximately 10-15%,Blood volume increases by approximately 5%,Blood volume remains constant,A,"Cardiovascular changes during pregnancy include:increase in cardiac output can be up to 30-50% in a normal, singleton pregnancy Heart rate rises by 10-15 beats/min above baseline Blood volume slowly increases by 40-50%. Stroke volume increases by 25-30% Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) decreases by 20-30% Diastolic blood pressure pressures decrease to a nadir during the second trimester (dropping 5–10 mm Hg below baseline), but the majority of the decrease occurs early in pregnancy (6- to 8-week gestational age) compared with preconception values. increases again to pre-pregnancy levels by 36 weeks , and this explains why cardiac problems are likely to present in early pregnancy.During pregnancy blood volume increases slowly by 40-50%. The increase is thought to be due to increased Aldosterone"
basic medicine,8,Animals an unlikely source of which of the following diseases?,Listeriosis,Leptospirosis,Cholera,Brucellosis,Tuberculosis,C,"Zoonoses include: ∙ Anthrax (cattle, goats)∙ Listeriosis (pets)∙ Leptospirosis (rats)∙ Toxocara (cats)∙ Toxoplasmosis (dogs)∙ Tapeworms (dogs)∙ Brucella (sheep)∙ TB (cattle).Cholera is an infectious gastroenteritis caused by eating food (including unwashed fruit and vegetables) or drinking water contaminated with cholera vibrios.There are no animal hosts but cholera vibrios can attach to crustaceans (copepods). Contaminated seafood from the Gulf of Mexico is a likely source of some outbreaks of cholera in the USA."
basic medicine,9,The external anal sphincter is innervated by which nerves?,Superior rectal,Pelvic Splanchnic,Ilioinguinal,Inferior rectal,genitofemoral,D,The correct answer is inferior rectal nerveAnal Sphincter Internal anal sphincterInvoluntary Sympathetic contraction Parasympathetic relaxation Innervation via Pelvic splanchnic nerves (S4)External anal sphincterVoluntary Innervation via inferior rectal branch of pudendal nerve and perineal branch of S4
basic medicine,10,"A 37-year-old man presents with an anterior myocardial infarction. He admits to smoking 20 cigarettes per day. His lipid screening on admission reveals total cholesterol of 9.5 mmol/L, triglycerides are at the upper end of the normal range. Which of the following is the most likely abnormality?",Apolipoprotein A mutation,Apolipoprotein E mutation,HDL receptor mutation,LDL receptor mutation,Triglyceride receptor mutation,D,"LDL receptor mutations may range from complete absence of the receptor to receptors which are present but only partially functioning. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is an autosomal dominant disorder, and total cholesterol of 9.5 suggests that he is a heterozygote. Abetalipoproteinaemia leads to the absence of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Apolipoprotein A mutations result in defective high-density lipoprotein (HDL). HDL receptor mutations result in increased levels of HDL, triglyceride receptor mutations in increased levels of triglycerides."
basic medicine,11,Which of the following is correct regarding uterine blood flow in normal pregnancy?,It is reduced by prostacyclin,It is increased during uterine contractions,It represents about 10% of the cardiac output by the end of the first trimester,It is about 50 ml/minute at term,Within the chorio‐decidual space is maintained throughout the cardiac cycle,C,"Uterine blood flow (UBF) is 500‐750 ml/min at term, which at that time is 10‐15% of cardiac output.UBF increases gradually and therefore is likely to be significantly lower than 10% of the cardiac output at the end of the first trimester.Prostacyclin is a vasodilator and therefore increases uterine blood flow. Uterine contractions tend to interrupt uterine blood flow."
basic medicine,12,Which of the following is involved in the metabolism of warfarin?,CYP2C19,CYP2C9,CYP2D6,CYP3A4,CYP2E1,B,"Warfarin is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) The CYP450 isozymes involved in the metabolism of warfarin include CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2, and 3A4. CYP2C9 is thought to be the most important. CYP3A4 is very important in metabolism of other drugs such as ciclosporin and tacrolimus. CYP2D6 is important for haloperidol and SSRIs. CYP2E1 is improtant in many volatile anaesthetics."
basic medicine,13,"With regard to the abdominal vasculature, which of the following is correct?",The inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery arises from the inferior mesenteric artery,The left gastro-epiploic artery arises from the gastroduodenal artery,The right gastric artery rises from the hepatic artery,The right gastro-epiploic artery arises from the splenic artery,The superior rectal artery arises from the internal iliac artery,C,"The ventral branches of the aorta include the coeliac artery and superior and inferior mesenteric arteries. These ventral branches give rise to:  Left gastric artery branches with the aortic oesophageal branches around the lower oesophagus. Anterior and posterior superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries (coeliac trunk) with the inferior pancreaticoduodenal (superior mesenteric branch) around the head of the pancreas and second part of the duodenum. The marginal artery anastomosis between the middle colic and the left colic. The superior rectal artery (inferior mesenteric) with the middle rectal (internal iliac) and/or the inferior rectal (internal pudendal from internal iliac).  The right gastric artery most frequently originates from the proper hepatic artery (~53%). It can also originate:  from the region where common hepatic artery divides into its branches (~20%) from the left hepatic branch (~15%) as a branch of the gastroduodenal artery (~8%), or as branch of the common hepatic artery (~4%).  "
basic medicine,14,The velocity of an enzyme reaction,"For a given concentration of enzyme, is proportional to the substrate concentration",Is independent of the substrate concentration,Is lowest at time t = 0,Is independent of the concentration of product,Is highest at time t = 0,E,"ENZYME KINETICS∙ VELOCITY: The rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction. Highest at time t=0 (initial velocity, V0)because the substrate concentration is maximum and there is no product formed (product mayhave feed-back inhibition on enzyme activity)∙ If the substrate concentration is progressively increased for a fixed enzyme concentration, therecomes a point where all the active sites on the enzyme are occupied and the initial velocity ofthe reaction cannot be increased further. This is the maximum velocity Vmax∙ If there is an excess of substrate, the initial velocity is proportional to the enzyme concentrationand vice-versa∙ The initial velocity is given by the Michaelis-Menten equation:V0 = (Vmax[S]) /([S] +Km): Km = Michaelis constant which is the substrate concentration atwhich the initial velocity of the reaction is half the maximum velocity"
basic medicine,15,Which of the following nerves supplies the abductor digiti minimi muscle?,Radial nerve,Axillary nerve,Tibial nerve,Median nerve,Ulnar nerve,E,The ulnar nerve supplies flexor carpi ulnaris and most of the small intrinsic muscles of the hand.
basic medicine,16,The greater splanchnic nerves usually synapse in which of the following?,Coeliac ganglion ,Ganglia of the lower thoracic sympathetic trunk ,Hypogastric plexus ,Inferior mesenteric ganglion ,Superior mesenteric ganglion ,A,The greater splachnic nerves arise from T5-T9 and pass forwards and downwards on the sides of the vertebral bodies. They pierce the crus of the diaphragm and then join the coeliac ganglion.

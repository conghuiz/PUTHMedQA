respiratory system,1,"You are the medical SHO in A and E A 22-year-old female is admitted very distressed and short of breath. She is struggling to speak in full sentences and is taccypnoeic. Examination reveals a respiratory rate of 35/min, a pulse of 120 beats per minute, a blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, oxygen saturations of 90% and a peak expiratory flow rate less than50% predicted. The emergency medical services have administered salbutamol 5 mg (twice) and face mask oxygen. An ABG is pending. Which of the following is the most appropriate next action in this patient?",Attempt intubation,Intensive care referral,Oxygen 35%,Prednisolone 40 mg,Salbutamol 5 mg and ipratropium bromide 0.5 mg with oxygen,E,"This patient fits the criteria for life-threatening asthma (saturations under 92% in air). In such cases β2-agonists should be administered as soon as possible, preferably nebulised driven by oxygen. Repeat doses should be given at 15-30 minute intervals, or continuous nebulisation can be used where there is inadequate response to bolus therapy. Nebulised ipratropium bromide should be added for patients with acute severe or life-threatening asthma, or those with a poor initial response. Its addition produces significantly greater bronchodilation than a β2-agonist alone. Oxygen should be given to maintain saturations at 94-98%. Patients with saturations less than 92% on air should have an ABG to exclude hypercapnia. However, starting treatment should not be delayed to do the ABG. Initially high-flow oxygen is used, and then weaned to maintain adequate saturations. Unless you suspect COPD there is not a need to be cautious with oxygen therapy. Steroids reduce mortality, relapses, subsequent hospital admission and requirement for β2-agonists1. The earlier they are given in the attack, the better the outcome. A dose of 40-50 mg should therefore be given once oxygen and nebuliser therapy has been established. This should be continued for five days, or until recovery, and can then be stopped abruptly unless the patient has taken long term oral corticosteroids. Failure to respond to the above treatment steps may warrant the use of intravenous magnesium sulphate and aminophylline. However, these should not be used without discussion with your senior colleagues. Intensive care is indicated for patients with severe acute or life-threatening asthma who are failing to respond to therapy. Consider it in patients with deteriorating peak flow, persisting or worsening hypoxia, hypercapnia, acidosis, exhaustion or altered conscious state. All patients who are transferred to an intensive care unit should be accompanied by a doctor who can intubate if necessary. As an aside, chest radiographs are not indicated unless you suspect pneumothorax or consolidation, or there is life-threatening asthma, a failure to respond to treatment or a need for ventilation. Attempting intubation prior to further therapy is the wrong thing to do especially if inexperienced in this technnique and there are other treatments you can try first before this step. "
respiratory system,2,"In an acute pulmonary embolism (PE), which of the following statements is correct?",D-dimer assay has high specificity,"If associated with a pleural effusion, is characteristically haemorrhagic",If the embolus obstructs less than 10% of pulmonary circulation it is regarded as minor,"If the x ray is normal, then one must question the diagnosis",The white cell count (WCC) is characteristically less than 10,B,"D-dimer assay has high sensitivity but low specificity (also positive in disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), malignancy, and following surgery). Surprisingly enough, a PE is considered minor if it obstructs less than 50% of the pulmonary vasculature. The chest x ray is often normal. PE has characteristically increased WCC and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)."
respiratory system,3,A 19-year-old smoker presents to the Emergency department with right sided pleuritic chest pain and dyspnoea. He has no previous medical history. His BP is 120/75 mmHg. A CXR is done and confirms a right sided pneumothorax with a rim of 2.5 cm. Which of the following is the best course of action?,Advise to stop smoking and discharge,Aspirate,Check arterial blood gases and only if hypoxic aspirate,Insert a chest drain,Repeat the CXR in two hours,B,Aspiration is indicated in spontaneous primary pneumothorax if breathless and/or there is a rim of air greater than 2 cm on chest x ray. Blood gases will not affect the decision making in the above scenario. Chest drain is not indicated at this stage. Consult the most recent pneumothorax guidelines from the British Thoracic Society.
respiratory system,4,"A 48 year old gentleman presents with extreme tiredness and difficulty concentrating.  His wifes states he is irritable and he is a very loud snorer and occasionally chokes during the night.  His libido is low, he is suffering from headaches and he has been falling asleep during the day as he feels very unrefreshed after his sleep.  His BMI is 35. Polysomnography reveals a apnoea/hyponoea index of 10. His ABGs do not reveal significant hypoxia. Which of the following is useful initially in the management?",LTOT,Weight loss and lifestyle advice,ABGs,BiPAP,CPAP,B,"The diagnosis is obstructive sleep apneoa and these symptoms are classically of this. It is diagnosed via polysomnography whereby physiological recordnings are made during sleep and the number of apnoea/hypopnoea episodes are measured.  ABGs can be utilised to assess degree of hypoxia overnight and to therefore if CPAP is required however do not give the definitive diagnosis. OSA lead to RTAs sue to daytime sleepiness and it can lead to pulmonary hypertension and corpulmonale.  Lifestyle advice such as weight loss, smoking cessation and reduced alcohol advice should be given and is very useful initially. This man has a BMI of 35 and therefore weight loss is very important. His polysomnography reveals mild OSA and no significant hypoxia and thus CPAP is not indicated at this stage as it is most useful in moderate to severe and those with significant hypoxia.  Other management options include intra oral devisces to anterior displace the mandible and surgical techniques have been utilised."
respiratory system,5,"Pulmonary function tests reveal a reduced FEV1/FVC ratio, reduced gas transfer and increased total lung capacity. There is little improvement after salbutamol. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Interstitial lung disease,Asthma,Pulmonary embolism,Pneumonia,COPD,E,These results are in keeping with an obstructive pattern therefore asthma and COPD re the only options which lead to an obstructive picture. The fact there is little response to salbutamol makes COPD much more likely.
respiratory system,6,A 24 year old male presents with a primary pneumothorax. It is approximately 3 cm and he is breathless. An aspiration was unsuccessful what is the next step in management?,High flow oxygen,Pleurodesis,Discharge and outpatient follow up,Insertion of a chest drain,Reaspirate,D,Where aspiration has been unsuccessful i.e. breathing not improved and not reduced to less than 2cm the next stage in management is insertion of a chest drain.
respiratory system,7,"You are an SHO working in the Emergency department when a 67-year-old gentleman with known COPD attends via ambulance. He has a short history of increasing breathlessness. He denies a productive cough. On arrival he is dyspnoeic with a respiratory rate of 33. Other observations are as follows saturations 88% on 28% O2, HR 105 bpm, BP 118/86 mmHg, temperature 36.9°C. On examination he has a widespread polyphonic wheeze. A blood gas 45 minutes after arrival and following initial treatment is performed, results are as below.    pH 7.24 (7.36-7.44)   PCO2 8.8 kPa (4.7-6.0)   PO2 8.4 kPa (11.3-12.6)    What should your management be?",Call ITU for consideration on invasive ventilation,Continue controlled oxygen and repeated nebuliser therapy - repeat gas in 45 minutes,"Continue controlled oxygen, nebulised therapy and IV antibiotics (repeat gas in 45 minutes)",Start non-invasive ventilation (NIV) on settings 10 IPAP and 4 EPAP,Start non-invasive ventilation (NIV) on settings 14 IPAP and 4 EPAP,A,"This patient has an exacerbation of COPD, defined as sustained worsening of the patient's symptoms which is acute in onset. This may include worsening breathlessness, cough, increased sputum and change in sputum colour. The diagnosis is usually made clinically. Supporting investigations include a chest radiograph, arterial blood gases, ECG, routine bloods and sputum and blood cultures. Treatment is with bronchodilators, nebulised in the majority of patients. If a patient is hypercapnic or acidotic, as in this case, these should be driven by compressed air. If oxygen therapy is needed it should be administered simultaneously by nasal cannulae. Oxygen should be given to maintain SaO2 within the patient's individual target range, if available (COPD patients are being given cards with this information, so always ask). ABGs should be repeated at regular intervals to monitor response to treatment, and oxygen weaned when available. Oral corticosteroids should also be given: 30 mg prednisolone for 7-14 days. Prolonged courses offer no additional benefit. Antibiotics should be used to treat exacerbations associated with more purulent sputum, consolidation on chest radiograph, or clinical signs of pneumonia. Empirical antibiotic choice should be guided by local policy, and altered to take account of any subsequent culture results. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the treatment of choice for persistent hypercapnic ventilation failure despite optimal medical therapy. It has been shown in RCTs to reduce intubation rate and mortality in COPD patients with decompensated respiratory acidosis (pH less than7.35 and pCO2 greater than6 kPa). NIV should therefore be considered within the first 60 minutes of hospital arrival in all patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD in whom a respiratory acidosis persists despite maximal medical therapy (controlled oxygen, nebulised salbutamol and ipratropium, prednisolone, antibiotic (where indicated). Exceptions may be:  life threatening hypoxaemia (when invasive ventilation may be more appropriate) severe co-morbidity severe cognitive impairment (where NIV is not tolerated) facial burns/trauma/surgery vomiting fixed upper airway obstruction undrained pneumothorax upper GI surgery unprotected airway, copious respiratory secretions, and haemodynamic instability requiring inotropes.  Patients should be sitting or semi-recumbant, and a full-face mask used initially. An initial inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) of 10 cmH2O and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) of 4-5 cmH2O should be used. IPAP should be increased by 2-5 cm increments every 10 minutes, with a usual target of 20 cmH2O or until a therapeutic response is achieved. Oxygen can be introduced into the circuit, usually with a target saturation of 88-92%. Bronchodilators are preferably administered off NIV. Patients should be closely monitored, including ABG, respiratory rate and heart rate. ABGs should be repeated after one hour of NIV therapy, and one hour after subsequent change in settings or four hours in stable patients. All non-invasive ventilation services should have their own local protocol based on these guidelines. There should be a clear plan of what to do in the event of deterioration. Patients with a pH less than7.26 should be managed with a low threshold for intubation, and this should be considered in this case. Functional status, BMI, requirement for oxygen when stable, comorbidities and previous admissions should be considered in addition to age and FEV1 when assessing suitability. Whilst in clinical practice you would give NIV whilst awaiting consideration from intensive care, it is important to consider intubation in this patient who is failing to improve and remains persistently severely acidotic. Intravenous theophylline should be used only if there is an inadequate response to nebulised bronchodilators. Levels should be closely monitored. Respiratory stimulants are only indicated when NIV is inappropriate, and their use supervised by a specialist physician. There is no indication from the information provided that this is an infective exacerbation so the use of antibiotics at this time is not indicated. "
respiratory system,8,Which of the following does not lead to a pH of less than 7.2 in pleural effusion?,Rheumatoid arthritis,Malignancy,Tuberculosis,Congestive cardiac failure,Empyema,D,PH of less than 7.2 is seen in all of these options except congestive cardiac failure.
respiratory system,9,A 59-year-old man presents to the general medical on call with a hoarse voice. He is known to smoke some 20 cigarettes per day. He has not lost any weight over the past few months but has a chronic cough for which he has been prescribed a steroid inhaler. He drinks 30 units of alcohol per week. Which of the following would particularly prompt you to investigate him further?,Alcohol history,History of cough,Hoarse voice for longer than three weeks,No response to steroid inhaler,Smoking history,C,Under NICE guidelines a hoarse voice for three weeks or more is an indication for investigation to exclude malignancy. This is particularly the case in patients with a history of alcohol consumption or smoking. Whilst alcohol and smoking history would both increase the suspicion of an underlying carcinoma it is the duration of hoarseness which would raise most concern. A history of cough might be expected given he is a smoker and a response to steroid inhaler would not be expected anyway. No response to steroid inhaler is very non-specific.
respiratory system,10,A man with chronic cough presents with copious purulent sputum. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Bronchitis,Bronchiectasis,COPD,Pneumonia,Emphysema,B,Chronic cough with copious purulent sputum is suggestive of bronchiectasis
respiratory system,11,"A 25-year-old man presents to the Emergency department with shortness of breath. One week ago he developed influenza and has become more short of breath and fatigued in the last 24 hours. His temperature is 38.5°C, his SaO2 is 90% on 2 L of oxygen, a blood pressure 100/60 mmHg and heart rate 120/min. The CXR shows patchy consolidation. Which antibiotic therapy should you select for this man?",Amoxicillin,Amoxicillin and flucloxacillin,Co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin,Co-amoxiclav,Flucloxacillin,C,"This gentleman has community acquired pneumonia (CAP). The recent history of influenza may lead you to consider staphylococcus aureus as the possible underlying organism, although this is an uncommon cause of CAP in the UK. It is more common in the winter months, and coincident influenza-type symptoms in approximately 40%. Pneumonia complications approximately 3% of cases of influenza, 10% of those admitted have been confirmed to be due to Staphyloccus aureus. In the majority of patients CAP should be confirmed by chest radiography before the commencement of antibiotics. However, if patients are critically unwell they should be treated for the presumptive diagnosis. Antibiotic treatment should always be initiated within 4 hours of presentation. CAP caused by Staphyloccus aureus is more likely to present with multilobar shadowing, cavitation, pneumatoceles and spontaneous pneumothorax than other organisms. However, there are no characteristic features of chest radiographs that allow a confident prediction of the likely pathogen. Therefore, the general guidelines for treatment of CAP should be followed until an organism is identified. Staphylococcus aureus carries a high mortality, and therefore if suspected treatment should initially be for a severe CAP (see below for details). Low severity CAP (CURB 0-1) can be treated with amoxicillin 500mg TDS PO. CURB 2 CAP should be treated with amoxicillin 500 mg-1 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. Alternatives are available if patients are allergic to any of the above combinations. High severity CAP (CURB 3-5) should be treated as soon as possible with co-amoxiclav 1.2 g TDS and clarithromycin 500 mg BD. The oral route is recommended in those with low and moderate severity CAP. Patients treated with parenteral antibiotics initially should be switched to an oral regimen once clinical improvement is seen and the patients has been afebrile for at least 24 hours. For most patients with uncomplicated CAP 7 days of antibiotic treatment is recommended. For those with high severity pneumonia where an organism has not been identified, 7-10 days treatment is indicated and extended to 14-21 days where clinically needed. If Staphylococcus aureus is identified, treatment should be altered. Non-MRSA organisms should be treatment with flucloxacillin and/or rifampicin; an alternative for penicillin-allergic patients is teicoplanin and rifampicin. MRSA should be treated with vancomycin. A prolonged antibiotic course is indicated. "
respiratory system,12,"A 72-year-old lifelong smoker presents with progressive dyspnoea on exertion. He has a chronic, non-productive cough. On examination he is thin, breathing with pursed lips, respiratory rate 25/min, with mild wheezing on chest auscultation. Investigations show    FEV1 0.8 L   FVC 1.6 L   pH 7.35   paCO2 6kPa (45mmHg)   paO2 7.2kPa (55mmHg)    What is the predominant mechanism of the airflow limitation in this gentleman?",Bronchospasm,Foreign body obstruction,Increased airways resistance,Loss of elastic recoil,Mucus plugging in the small airways,D,This patient has typical features of chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) with a predominant emphysematous element. The pathology is centrilobular or panacinar with loss of elastic tissue. Brocnhospasm is seen in conditions such as asthma. Increased airway resisitance is also seen in COPD though not specific to it.  Mucus plugging is often seen in conditions such as Cystic Fibrosis or Bronchiectasis.
respiratory system,13,A 75-year-old man presents with Bell’s palsy. His past medical history is significant for late onset asthma and heart failure. He also reports to have consulted his GP for generalized rash previously. CXR shows multiple soft shadows and CBC eosinophilia. What is the single most likely positive antibody?,P ANCA,C ANCA,Anti Ro,Anti DS DNA,Anti centromere,A,"The diagnosis is Charg Strauss Syndrome (CSS). There are six criteria for diagnosis of CSS: Asthma (wheezing, expiratory rhonchi). Eosinophilia of more than 10% in peripheral blood. Paranasal sinusitis. Pulmonary infiltrates (may be transient). Histological confirmation of vasculitis with extravascular eosinophils. Mononeuritis multiplex or polyneuropathy. The presence of four out of six of these features has a high specificity and sensitivity for the diagnosis of CSS. In the given case there are 1. Bell’s palsy (mononeuritis multiplex) 2. Asthma 3. Multiple soft shadows on CXR (pulmonary infiltrates) 4. Eosinophilia. Presence of these 4 features are diagnostic of CSS. In CSS 70% patient is p-ANCA positive!"
respiratory system,14,"A 39-year-old man presents to the emergency department with persistent cough, sputum and dyspnea. He gave a history of smoking 20 cigarettes/day for the last 10 years. Patient was given oxygen in ambulance but he is not improving. What is the next step?",Prednisolone,Salbutamol,Check ABG,CXR,ECG,C,"The patient has COPD and as no improvement with oxygen, next step is to check ABG to give guidance for next treatment plan (need for assisted ventilation)"
respiratory system,15,A 52 year old presents with shortness of breath wheeze and nocturnal cough. He has noticed coughing up blood on several occasions. He also complains of feeling generally unwell with a headache and fever. Bloods reveal an elevated eosinophil count and IgE. Skin testing and serology are positive for aspergillus. A CXR is awaited. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,Churg Strauss syndrome,Wegeners granulomatosis,Aspergilloma,Allergic Bronchopulmonary Aspergillosis,E,"This patient presents with features of features of asthma and haemoptysis with the finding of increased IgE, eosinophil count and aspergillus positive. This is in keeping with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. Aspergilloma is normally found in a background of cavitating lung disease such as TB and does not usually present with asthma. Invasive aspergillosis is observed in immunocompromised. Wegeners does not usually present with asthma and does not have elevated eosinophils. Churg Strauss would normally have features of rhinitis and not test positive for aspergillus."
respiratory system,16,A patient with Goodpastures syndrome is  found to have an elevated diffusion capacity.  What is the likely cause of this elevation?,Pulmonary Haemorrhage,Asthma,COPD,Pulmonary embolus,Smoking,A,Pulmonary haemorrhage is a common complication of Goodpastures syndrome.  Due to the excess red blood cells in the alveoli and interstitium there is an artificial increase in the diffusion capacity.

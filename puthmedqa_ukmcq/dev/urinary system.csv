urinary system,1,A 33-year-old male who is receiving regular haemodialysis is noted to have a plasma potassium of 6.9 mmol/L (3.5-4.9) before a dialysis session. Usually his potassium is less than 5.5 mmol/L. Which food combination from the dietary history would be most likely to cause the high potassium concentration?,"Cereal, toast, biscuits.","Filter coffee, tea, boiled potatoes.","Milk, butter, plain yoghurt","Milk, ham, chicken.","Tomato, potato crisps, banana.",E,In particular tomato and banana have high potassium content and patients should be advised to avoid such foods. 
urinary system,2,Which of the following relate to dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors?,Enhance the effect of levodopa on the substantia nigra,Have anticholinergic activity,Prevent L-dopa associated dyskinesias,Reduce the extracerebral complications of L-dopa therapy,Should not be given in combination with dopamine agonists,D,"Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors prevent the systemic metabolism of levodopa which leads to higher central nervous system (CNS) levels. The effect itself is not enhanced, only the concentration of available levodopa. Dyskinesias are a CNS effect of levodopa. Dopa-decarboxylase inhibitors reduce the extracerebral complications of L-dopa therapy. These include nausea, vomiting, postural hypotension and cardiac arrhythmias. When given in combination with dopamine agonists dyskinetic movements are more likely."
urinary system,3,"A 55 year old woman presents to the gynaecology outpatients clinic with a 2 year history of recurrent urinary tract infection. Today she does not report any dysuria or frequency, however she reports a longstanding sensation of incomplete bladder emptying. She reports no prolapse symptoms. Her general and abdominal examination was unremarkable. On vaginal examination she has a grade II cystocele and no other evidence of prolapse. Her cervix was healthy and the uterus was anteverted and small. No adnexal masses were felt. Urine dipstick analyses is NAD. What is the most appropriate next investigation?",Perform a cystoscopy,Perform urodynamic testing,Assess her post void residual using ultrasound,Send a urine sample for culture,Assess her post void residual using a catheter,C,The post void residual (PVR) is the volume of urine left in the bladder after voiding. It can cause recurrent urinary tract infections. PVR should be measured in women reporting a sensation of incomplete emptying and recurrent urinary tract infections. Measurement with a catheter is uncomfortable and caries a risk of urinary tract infection. The preferential use of the bladder scan is described by NICE
urinary system,4,"A 42-year-old woman presents to nephrology clinic. She has end stage renal disease due to type 1 diabetes mellitus, and is awaiting transplant. She has been using peritoneal dialysis for six months. She is complaining of fatigue and you note her haemoglobin to be 96 g/L. You are considering commencing erythropoietin treatment. What is the most common side effect of erythropoietin when used in patients with chronic kidney disease?",Blurred vision,Hepatotoxicity,Hypertension,Hypokalaemia,Thrombocytopenia,C,"Erythropoietin therapy may be considered in patients with chronic kidney disease who have anaemia to increase haemoglobin concentration to 110-120 g/L. Serious side-effects of erythropoietin, when used in chronic kidney disease, are:  hypertension - 20% of patients require increased antihypertensive therapy seizures thromboembolic disease anaphylaxis failure of treatment - this may be due to untreated iron deficiency, marrow fibrosis, drug therapy, development of antibodies against the treatment, testosterone deficiency in males, or poor compliance.  Blurred and hepatotoxicity are not recognised side effects. New or worsening hypertension is a common side effect of erythropoietin therapy. Twenty percent of patients will require increased antihypertensive therapy. Erythropoietin may even precipitate a hypertensive crisis. Hypokalaemia is not a recognised side effect. Instead, hyperkalaemia may occur. Thrombocytopenia is not a recognised side effect. A dose-dependent rise in platelet count is common, due to erythropoietin affinity for thrombopoietin receptors."
urinary system,5,"A 15-year-old girl was seen by her family physician because of increasing lethargy. She had a recent history of the andquot;fluandquot;. Biochemistry tests show that she has renal impairment.    Serum sodium 140 mmol/L (137-144)   Serum potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-4.9)   Serum urea 28 mmol/L (2.5-7.5)   Serum creatinine 280 µmol/L (60-110)    Her condition does not improve after several weeks on corticosteroid therapy, so a renal biopsy is performed. The biopsy demonstrates the presence of segmental sclerosis of three of 10 glomeruli identified in the biopsy specimen. Immunofluorescence studies and electron microscopy do not reveal evidence for immune deposits. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding her condition?",She has an underlying malignancy,She may require a renal transplant in 10 years,She will improve if she loses weight,She will likely develop a restrictive lung disease,She will probably improve with additional corticosteroid therapy,B,"The findings in this case point to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). which leads to chronic renal failure in half of cases. This accounts for approximately 20% of cases of nephrotic syndrome in children and 40% in adults. It is one of the most common primary glomerular disorders causing end-stage renal failure. Proteinuria is the classic clinical feature, and is typically accompanied by hypoalbuminaemia, hypercholesterolaemia and peripheral oedema. The cardinal feature on renal biopsy is progressive glomerular scarring. Early in the disease course, glomerulosclerosis involves a minority of glomeruli (focal) and only a portion of the glomerular globe (segmental). As the disease progresses more widespread glomerulosclerosis develops. This is due to podocyte injury which leads to effacement of the podocyte foot processes. 80% of causes of FSGS are idiopathic, thought to be mediated by circulating permeability factors. Secondary forms can be familial (due to mutations in specific podocyte genes), viral (HIV-1, parovirus B19, CMV, EBV), drug-induced (heroin, IFN, lithium, pamidronate, anabolic steroids, calcineurin inhibitors), or adaptive (unilateral renal agenesis, hypertension, sickle cell anaemia, vaso-occlusion). Treatment is aimed at preserving renal function, and inducing remission of proteinuria. Secondary causes should be excluded, as treatment should be targeted at the underlying condition in these cases. Idiopathic cases are treated with renin-angiotensin blockade and dietary sodium restriction initially. If nephrotic syndrome is present, high-dose glucocorticoid therapy should be initiated and slowly tapered over a period of 3-6 months if a response is seen. If FSGS is glucocorticoid resistant, therapy is with a calcineurin inhibitor. A significant number of patients with FSGS go on to end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Unfortunately, FSGS recurs in 40% of renal transplants. Risk factors for recurrence include age 6-15 years, Caucasian, rapid course to ESRF (less than3 years), heavy proteinuria prior to transplantation and previous allograft loss. Plasmapheresis has been showed to lead to remission, if used early in the course of recurrence. "
urinary system,6,A 16-year-old girl developed pulmonary haemorrhage and acute renal failure requiring dialysis. She has a history of recurrent epistaxis. Investigations revealed:    Renal biopsy Crescentic glomerulonephritis    Which one of the following antibodies is most likely to be found in the blood?,Anticardiolipin,Anticentromere,Antimitochondrial,Antiproteinase 3,Antinuclear,D,"This patient manifests a pulmonary renal syndrome which is most commonly due to an antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody test (ANCA) positive vasculitis and less commonly due to Goodpasture's syndrome (antiglomerular basement membrane [GBM] antibodies). The history of epistaxis makes Granulomatosis with polyangiitis the more likely diagnosis. ANCA antibodies are of two types:  cANCA which correlates with antiproteinase 3 antibodies (PR3)cANCA and specificity for the PR3 antigen is most specific for Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Proteinase-3 is a neutral serine proteinase present in azurophil granules of human neutrophils. Antibodies against it may be present in isolation without a cANCA. In Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the level of PR3 antibody and ANCA titre are related to disease activity and the antibodies typically disappear when the disease is in remission. pANCA and/or antibody to MPO are far less specific than cANCA and can be present in a range of inflammatory conditions such as microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome and Goodpasture's syndrome. MPO and pANCA may also be present in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and occasionally in chronic infections. They are positive in 10% of patients with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and are the most likely antibody to be present in this case, where proteinase-3 is not an option.  Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a multi-organ autoimmune disease which can be fatal. The classical triad consists of:  Necrotising granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract Glomerulonephritis, and A small-vessel vasculitis.  A prolonged history of epistaxis or sinusitis is commonly found in Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, which in some patients is also associated with an eosinophilia. The detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies directed against proteinase-3 is highly specific, but is found in only 50% of patients with disease localised to the respiratory tract and 95% with generalised Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Standard therapy is with cyclophosphamide and corticosteroids. TNF-alpha blocking agents, antithymocyte globulin and monoclonal anti-T cell antibodies can be used in disease refractory to these agents. Systemic inflammation and vasculitis contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and there is therefore a significantly increased incidence of stroke, myocardial infarction and occlusive artery disease. Antimitochondrial antibodies are found in primary biliary cirrhosis. Anticentromere antibodies are found in CREST/scleroderma syndrome. Aniinuclear (ANA) and anticardiolipin antibodies are found in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) which is not a cause of pulmonary renal syndrome. "
urinary system,7,"A 25-year-old female presents with a two-day history of diplopia and unsteadiness. Two weeks ago she suffered an upper respiratory tract infection. On examination there is complete ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and gait ataxia. Which of the following blood tests is the most likely to confirm the underlying diagnosis?",Acetylcholine receptors antibodies,Anti GM1 antibodies,Anti GQib antibodies,Anti-Hu antibodies,Anti-Purkinje cell antibodies,C,"The most likely diagnosis is Miller Fisher syndrome (variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome). It consists of complete or partial ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. It usually follows antecedent infections. Serum IgG antibody to the ganglioside GQib is present in more than 95% of patients. It is highly specific for the syndrome. Elevated levels of antibodies to the glycolipid ganglioside-monosialic acid (GM1 antibodies) have been shown in some instances to be associated with certain neurological disorders:  Lower motor neuron syndromes Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Multiple sclerosis Other multifocal neuropathies and Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with central nervous system involvement.  Neuronal nuclear (Hu) antibodies (NNA) are found in a number of paraneoplastic syndromes, including  Subacute sensory neuronopathy Paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis and Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration  and are associated with small cell lung carcinoma. Purkinje cell cytoplasmic antibodies are useful for identifying individuals with subacute cerebellar degeneration or peripheral neuropathy due to a remote (autoimmune) effect of gynecologic or breast carcinoma."
urinary system,8,"A 34-year-old woman presents to the Emergency department with a two day history of severe right-sided abdominal pain and increased temperature associated with chills and rigors. She also complains of burning micturition. She had undergone cystoscopy six days ago. On examination, her temperature is 39.3°C, she has warm and sweaty peripheries, and is tender over her right loin region. Urine microscopy reveals pus cells and casts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute glomerulonephritis,Goodpasture syndrome,Hydronephrosis,Pyelonephritis,Urinary tract infection,D,"This patient is most likely to have pyelonephritis secondary to the urological tract intervention, that is, cystoscopy. The risk factors for pyelonephritis include use of:  Urinary catheters Cystoscope Surgeries on the urinary tract Renal stones, and Enlarged prostate in males.  Pyelonephritis usually presents with:  severe loin pain chills rigor pyrexia warm and moist peripheries burning micturition, and increased urinary frequency and urgency.  There may be renal tenderness and tenderness over the affected iliac fossa. There may be associated constitutional symptoms such as headache, lassitude and nausea. Urine microscopy reveals pus cells and cast cells. Ultrasound is a very useful investigation to clinch the diagnosis. Other relevant investigations include intravenous pyelogram (IVP) and CT scan of the abdomen. IVU or CT scan of the abdomen may show enlarged kidneys with poor flow of dye through the kidneys (may also indicate underlying disorders). The complications of acute pyelonephritis include:  Renal scarring Renal failure Perinephric abscess Sepsis, and Progression to chronic pyelonephritis."
urinary system,9,A 27-year-old man presents with abdominal pain. He says his urine is dark. Examinations: BP 160/105mmHg. What is the most appropriate investigation?,US,Renal biopsy,CT,Urine protein,Urine microscopy,A,"Abdominal pain, Dark urine (hematuria) and hypertension suggests ADPKD. The sensitivity of ultrasonography for ADPKD1 is 99% for at-risk patients older than 20 years"
urinary system,10,"A 35-year-old gentleman presents with new onset renal failure and a non-blanching rash across his legs. In addition, he describes a history of recurrent sinus infections and nose bleeds. Which of the following tests are most likely to be diagnostic in this case?",ANA,C-ANCA,P-ANCA,Rheumatoid factor,Serum electrophoresis,B,"The question depicts a likely case of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and hence c-ANCA is the most likely diagnostic test of those listed. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a disease of granulomatous inflammation involving the kidney, upper respiratory and sinus tracts. It is most often associated with the anti-cytoplasmic ANCA (c-ANCA) positivity. Anti-nuclear antibody can be positive in a wide range of connective tissue diseases and is not the best diagnostic test listed and so is incorrect. P-ANCA is associated with microscopic polyangiitis and not Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and so should not be selected. Rheumatoid factor and serum electrophoresis for myeloma are not diagnostic tests in this case and so are incorrect."
urinary system,11,"Concerning urinalysis on patients with acute renal failure, which of the following is an association?",A high urine:plasma osmolality ratio in intrinsic renal failure,High urinary osmolality in prerenal failure,Low urinary chloride concentration in intrinsic renal failure,Low urinary urea and creatinine concentrations in prerenal failure,Red cell casts are present in pre-renal failure,B,"Pre-renal causes of acute renal failure (ARF) are associated with the following urinary findings:  Low urinary sodium and chloride concentration (less than20 mEq/l) High urinary urea and creatinine concentration (less than20 mEq/l) High urine osmolality (greater than400 mosmol/kg) High urine:plasma osmolality ratio (greater than1.8)  Intrinsic causes of acute renal failure (ARF), for example, acute tubular necrosis are associated with the following urinary findings:  High urinary sodium and chloride concentration (greater than40 mEq/l) Low urinary urea and creatinine concentrations Low urine osmolality (less than350) Low urine:plasma osmolality ratio (1.2)  It is important to note that the findings listed above may change when prerenal causes of ARF become superimposed on chronic intrinsic renal failure or following diuretic therapy. The presence of red cell casts suggests acute glomerular damage. Epithelial casts occur in acute tubular damage and forms of acute glomerulonephritis. White cell casts appear in pyelonephritis. Granular casts may indicate tubular damage, but they can also be found in the urine of normal individuals. Hyaline casts may be found during any febrile illness and after loop diuretic therapy."
urinary system,12,A 16-year-old girl presented with acute Guillain-Barré syndrome and has developed worsening proximal muscle weakness. Which one of the following tests should be used to monitor her respiratory function?,Arterial blood gas,Chest expansion,FEV1/FVC ratio,Peak expiratory flow rate,Vital capacity,E,"Diaphragmatic weakness occurs in one-third of patients with patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome and involvement of the neck muscles, tongue and palate leads to further respiratory compromise. Respiratory muscle function is best monitored by frequent assessment of the forced vital capacity (FVC). ITU admission is recommended when FVC is less than 20 mL/kg and intubation is recommended in most cases when FVC is less than 15 mL/kg. FVC is also the best way to monitor respiratory function in any neurological disorders that can affect the respiratory muscles (e.g. GBS, myasthenia gravis)."
urinary system,13,"A 22-year-old woman presents with a left sided postural tremor, a shuffling gait, dysarthric speech, ataxia and difficulty swallowing. She reports a family history of liver problems and tremor. Which is the most appropriate test to make a diagnosis?",Serum caeruloplasmin,CT head scan,Urine copper,Genetic testing,Serum copper,A,"The features described above should make you suspicious of Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disease linked to the q14-21 region on chromosome 13. Mutations within the ATP7B gene result in disruption of an ATPase within hepatocytes which is responsible for the movement of copper across intracellular membranes. This results in hepatic retention of copper, and low serum levels. A high index of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis of Wilson's disease. The age of onset can be between 6-20 years - in children it usually presents with liver dysfunction, whereas in young adults neuropsychiatric features typically dominate. The most common early neurological sign is an asymmetrical tremor, which can be resting, postural or kinetic. Other symptoms are dysarthria, excess salivations, ataxia and personality change. There can also be choreiform movements and pseudobulbar palsy. Kayser-Fleischer rings (a greenish gold or brown ring on the cornea) is present in up to 90% of symptomatic patients, but is not pathognomonic, There is no single test diagnostic of Wilson's disease. However, low serum caeruloplasmin (less than0.1 g/L) is highly suggestive of the diagnosis in the presence of characteristic clinical features. Elevated urinary excretion of copper and increased hepatic parenchymal copper concentration are supportive. Liver biopsy classically shows steatosis, glycogenated nuclei, focal hepatocellular necrosis, fibrosis and cirrhosis. MRI of the brain commonly shows increased density in the basal ganglia. Once a diagnosis of Wilson's disease is made, screening of first degree relatives (with genetic testing) should be done. Treatment of Wilson's disease aims to reduce body copper levels, and prevent it re-accumulating. Hepatotoxic drugs, alcohol and foods high in copper (liver, chocolate, shellfish etc.) should be avoided. Penicillamine is used to chelate copper, and excrete it in the urine. Adverse effects, such as skin disorders and bone marrow suppression, mean that one third of patients have to switch to totreintine or zinc. Life-long monitoring of biochemical and clinical features can help guide treatment. Liver transplant is usually reserved for patients with fulminant hepatic failure or those unresponsive to standard treatment. Early treatment allows a normal length of life, however without treatment Wilson's disease is usually fatal by the age of 40 years. None of the other tests listed are as diagnostic as caeruloplasmin for Wilson's disease."
urinary system,14,"A 71-year-old man attends the memory clinic with his wife. She has noticed that he has become progressively more forgetful over the past few years and has begun to wander at night. Most recently he became lost whilst shopping in the local village and had to be brought home by the police. This caused his wife significant distress. On examination in the clinic he has easily demonstrable short-term memory loss, with relative preservation of memory for events from his 40s. He also has visuospatial dysfunction. His BP is 142/72 mmHg, his pulse is 78 and regular. There are no murmurs or bruits on auscultation. Investigations showed    Haemoglobin 129 g/L (135-177)   White cells 7.4 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 193 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 141 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.6 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 μmol/L (79-118)   CT head Mild cortical atrophy    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Alzheimer's dementia,Lewy body dementia,Multi-infarct dementia,Multiple system atrophy,Pick's disease,A,"Given the relatively insidious onset of this gentleman's memory loss, now accompanied by visuospatial dysfunction, his unremarkable cardiovascular examination and relatively normal CT head, Alzheimer's dementia seems the most likely diagnosis. There are no features particularly consistent with emotional lability to indicate Pick's disease, and no features of Parkinson's, which would be consistent with Lewy body dementia or Multiple system atrophy. Prescription of cholinergic agonists depends on a mini-mental state score of between 10 and 20 points."
urinary system,15,A 37-year-old woman underwent a kidney transplant which never functioned. A biopsy revealed pathological features consistent with acute rejection associated with anti-HLA antibodies.  Which type of immunoglobulin is expected to account for this process?,Ig A,Ig D,Ig E,Ig G,Ig M,D,This acute rejection is recognised and due to anti-IgG antibodies to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) incompatible tissues with primary activation of T cells. The acute response is treated with immunosuppressants.
urinary system,16,Which of the following is not a cause of membranous nephropathy?,Lymphoma,Systemic lupus erythematous,Diabetes,Gold,Alports syndrome,E,Membranous nephropathy can be idiopathic or secondary to all of the options above except Alports syndrome. It leads to nephrotic syndrome and is due to deposition on immune complexes in the subepithelial space.

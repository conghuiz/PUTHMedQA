nervous system,1,A 17-year-old male is brought to clinic as his parents are concerned about changes in his behaviour. Which of the following suggest a diagnosis of schizophrenia?,"Auditory hallucinations, First person with clouding of consciousness",Feelings of panic in buses and shops,Grandiose ideations,Incongruity of affect,Memory impairment,D,"Incongruity of affect is emotion inappropriate to circumstances. Although not one of the first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, it is consistent with the diagnosis. Auditory hallucinations are typical, especially third person, but clouding of consciousness is not typical. The panic in crowds suggests an anxiety disorder and grandiose ideations suggest mania. "
nervous system,2,Which of the following is a feature of neurofibromatosis?,Kyphoscoliosis,Optic neuritis,Parathyroid adenoma,Vitiligo,Wrist ganglia,A,"Features of neurofibromatosis include:  Axillary freckling Café au lait pigmentation Scoliosis Neurofibrosarcomas Acoustic neuromas, and Optic gliomas."
nervous system,3,Which of the following features would support a diagnosis of depersonalization disorder?,A belief someone else has taken one's identity,A single episode of depersonalization,Losing touch with reality during episodes,Recurrent panic attacks in public,Repeated episodes of feeling detached from one's body,E,"A diagnosis of depersonalization disorder requires repeated episodes of feeling in some way unreal or detached from one's body, for example feeling like a robot, or as though one was in a dream state. Symptoms can include out of body experiences. The sufferer does not lose touch with reality and remains aware of the abnormal nature of the experience. A belief someone else has taken one's identity is a delusion of identity and hence indicative of a psychotic state. Recurrent panic attacks in public is indicative of panic disorder. "
nervous system,4,"A 45-year-old woman has right sided headaches, nausea and visual disturbance. This lasted for 24 hours and she is fine. She was recently started on hormone replacement therapy. What is the single most initial appropriate investigation?",Temporal artery biopsy,ESR,No investigation,Nerve conduction studies,MRI imaging of the brain,C,One sided headache lasting for 24 hours associated with nausea and visual disturbance without any focal neurological sign is highly suggestive of migraine. So for this “no investigation is needed”
nervous system,5,A 35-year-old male is bitterly annoyed with people around him. He thinks that people are putting ideas into his head. What is the single most likely diagnosis?,Thought block,Thought insertion,Thought broadcasting,Thought withdrawal,Reference,B,"Thought insertion is feeling as if one's thoughts are not one's own, but rather belong to someone else and have been inserted into one's mind. It is a common feature of schizophrenia"
nervous system,6,"A 54-year-old patient wakes up with right sided weakness. His current medication is bendroflumethiazide for HTN (hypertension). Pulse 92 bpm, BP 160/90mmHg. CT shows left cerebral infarct. What is the most appropriate treatment?",Alteplase,Aspirin,Clopidogrel,Dipyridamole,Simvastatin,B,In stroke window period to use alteplase is 4.5 hours. In the given history we can in no way certain the time of stroke and we can not proceed for alteplase unless window period is confirmed. Hence we cannot give alteplase but Aspirin
nervous system,7,You are referred a 14 year old boy as he has been noted to be ataxic and dysarthric.  On examination you notices he has a bilateral resting tremor and odd spasms in his facial muscles. Blood tests reveal deranged LFTs.  Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis to explain his signs and symptoms?,CJD,Huntingtons chorea,Parkinsons Disease,Motor Neurone Disease,Wilsons disease,E,Wilsons disease is the most likely diagnosis due to evidence of Tremor with cerebellar signs.  He is too young for Parkinsons and this would not explain the facial spasms.  The liver is usually affected by the abnormal copper metabolism as are the eyes leading to Kayser Fleischer rings.  There is also cognitive impairment.  Ceruloplasmin will confirm the diagnosis.
nervous system,8,"A man with a family history of panic disorder is brought to the hospital with palpitations, tremors,sweating and muscles tightness on 3 occasions in the last 6 weeks. He doesn’t complain of headache and his BP is within normal limit. What is the single most appropriate long-term treatment for him?",Diazepam,Olanzapine,Haloperidol,Fluoxetine,Alprazolam,D,Recommended treatment for panic disorder is i) CBT ii) Medication (SSRIs or TCA). NICE recommends a total of seven to 14 hours of CBT to be completed within a four month period. Treatment will usually involve having a weekly one-to-two-hour session. When drug is prescribed usually a SSRI is preferred. Antidepressants can take two to four weeks before becoming effective
nervous system,9,"A 45 year old male has attended the GP with his wife who has noticed a change in his personality and cognitive impairment over the last 6 months.  He has previous history of a stroke and TIAs.  He has a family history of stroke at young age.  His son has suffers from migraines and has presented with what seemed like TIAs. On examination he has a right hemiparesis, is hyperreflexic and has upgoing plantars.  He has an MMSE of 22/30.  What is the likely underlying diagnosis?",Early Onset Alzheimers,Mitochondrial encephalopathy with leucoencephalopathy and stroke like features (MELAS),Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leucoencephalopathy (CADASIL),Picks Disease,Vasculitis,C,CADASIL is the most likely diagnosis.  It has been associated with a mutation located on chromosome 9q12
nervous system,10,"A 19 year old is brought to A+E. He was on a night out 2 nights ago and is described by his friend as a ""party animal"". He is now acting very oddly. He is clearly hallucinating and is speaking rapidly. He is euphoric and laughing inappropriately. He appears agitated and his affect is blunted. His pupils are dilated and he is tachycardic. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Amphetamine induced psychosis,Schizophrenia,Heroin use,Cannibas induced psychosis,Bipolar disorder,A,"Amphetamine is a stimulant and this, cocaine and other hallucinogens can lead to psychosis as seen here. The other symptoms and clinical findings are inkeeping with this. The fact this patient was on a night out and is described as a party animal may suggest recreational drug use. Amphetamine induced psychosis can occur with drug misuse acutely or can be associated with chronic misuse. Cannibas tends to lead to depression and anxiety although it less commonly has been associated with manic like psychosis. Schizophrenia is less likely in this case as the findings are more in keeping with drug induced psychosis. There is no history to suggest bipolar disorder. Opiates lead to pupillary constriction and are less commonly associated with psychosis."
nervous system,11,"A 28-yer-old business man came to the sexual clinic. He was worried that he has HIV infection. 3 HIV tests were done and all the results are negative. After a few months, he comes back again and claims that he has HIV.

nervous system,12,A 70-year-old lady consulted her GP for being generally unwell. She also complained of constant severe headache and pain in the scalp while combing her hair. She has also noticed difficulty in standing up from the squatting position. She denied any visual disturbances. Her general physical examination was unremarkable and the investigations showed a raised ESR and alkaline phosphatase. What is an important diagnosis to consider?,Cervical spondylosis,Cluster headache,Hypothyroidism,Migraine,Temporal arteritis,E,Patients with temporal arteritis are at risk of irreversible visual loss either due to ischaemic damage to the ciliary arteries causing optic neuritis or central retinal artery occlusion. It is a preventable cause of blindness and hence should be considered. Cervical spondylosis can cause occipital headache and numbness due to the entrapment of C2 sensory nerve root. Hypothyroidism does not cause headaches. Migraine and cluster headaches often accompany visual symptoms and headache is intermittent and fluctuating in intensity.
nervous system,13,"A 31-year-old man who lives alone comes to the Emergency Department escorted by the police. They were called by a neighbour who noticed him applying silver foil to his windows. On admission he is agitated and aggressive. He is wearing a hat fashioned from silver foil which he tells you is designed to stop transmission of thoughts to inside his skull. It appears he has attended the Emergency Department three times previously, twice with alcohol abuse and once after a paracetamol overdose. Physical exam is unremarkable, although he is slim and looks unkempt. Whilst you're examining him he tells you that the blood bottles are lined up in such a way that it means he will be put to sleep. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Drug induced psychosis,Encephalitis,Hypomania,Personality disorder,Schizophrenia,E,"The answer is Schizophrenia. This patient is voicing concerns both about thought insertion, and is describing delusions of reference (the lining up of the blood bottles). Taken together these features imply underlying schizophrenia. The history of alcohol and drug abuse are risk factors for chronic mental illness. A multi-disciplinary approach, coupled with use of an atypical anti-psychotic is the initial management of choice. Although aggression and delusions are seen in patients with drug induced psychosis, personality disorders and hypomania, delusions of reference and thought insertion do not support these alternative diagnoses. Encephalitis is primarily associated with drowsiness, confusion and short term memory loss, and you would also expect some neurological or infective signs.  NICE guidance"

nervous system,15,"A young girl presenting with fever, headache, vomiting, neck stiffness and photophobia. She has no rashes. What is the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis?",Blood culture,Blood glucose,LP,CXR,CT,C,Case of meningitis. LP will confirm the diagnosis
nervous system,16,A 20-year-old girl with amenorrhea and BMI of 14 still thinks she has to lose weight.

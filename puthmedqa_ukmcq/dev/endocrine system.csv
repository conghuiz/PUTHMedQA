endocrine system,1,"A 50-year-old woman presented with a recently discovered, solitary, thyroid nodule. Which of the following would suggest a diagnosis of thyroid malignancy?",Elevated serum thyroglobulin concentration,Features of thyrotoxicosis,Ipsilateral Horner's syndrome,Previous I131 therapy,Tenderness over the nodule,C,The association of Horner's syndrome and a thyroid nodule would suggest invasion of the sympathetic chain and would suggest that this thyroid nodule is malignant. Previous I131 is not associated with the development of malignancy. Thyroglobulin may be elevated in any thyroiditis. Tenderness over the nodule would suggest a thyroiditis and thyrotoxicosis suggests a functional adenoma making the malignancy extremely unlikely. 
endocrine system,2,"A 16-year-old boy comes to the endocrine clinic with his father; he is tall and thin but is most concerned because his voice has not properly broken and he has not started to go through puberty. Other past history of note is that he has complained to his GP on a number of occasions that he has no sense of smell, and that food tastes bland. On examination he is 184 cm in height. His BMI is 21, his BP is 125/80 mmHg. He has very sparse sexual hair, small testes, and an underdeveloped phallus. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 134 g/L (115 - 165)   White cells 7.4 ×10^9/L (4 - 11)   Platelet 205 ×10^9/L (150 - 400)   Sodium 140 mmol/L (135 - 146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5 - 5)   Creatinine 92 µmol/L (79 - 118)   Serum testosterone 4 nmol/L (9 - 42)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Kallmann's syndrome,Klinefelter's syndrome,Noonan's syndrome,Pituitary apoplexy,Testicular feminisation,A,"A number of genes including KAL-1 and FGFR-1 are involved in the formation of the olfactory bulb area of the brain, which as well as being responsible for sense of smell, is also involved in the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Failure of this area of the brain to develop leads to an absent sense of smell and either not entering or partial puberty. GnRH or gonadotrophin-based preparations can be used to restore fertility, or testosterone can be used to drive development of secondary sexual characteristics. Kallmann's syndrome is the correct answer because anosmia, failure to enter puberty, and low testosterone are typical of the condition. Klinefelter's syndrome is incorrect because the lack of sense of smell should point you towards Kallman's as the alternative diagnosis. Noonan's syndrome is incorrect because it is associated with short stature, webbing of the neck, scoliosis, ligamentous laxity, and pectus excavatum. Pituitary apoplexy is incorrect because it is associated with deficiency of multiple pituitary hormones. Testicular feminisation is incorrect because it is associated with androgen insensitivity and subjects look externally female."
endocrine system,3,"A 48-year-old woman presents to her GP with Cushingoid facies and hyperpigmentation of the skin on her face and chest. She has smoked 20 cigarettes per day for 30 years. Examination reveals no gross abnormalities. Her chest x ray reveals a 2 cm irregularly shaped mass in the right upper lobe, in proximity to the mediastinum. A CT guided needle biopsy of the lung lesion is performed. Which would be the most likely cytologic finding?",Adenocarcinoma,Benign bronchial adenoma,Bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma (BAC),Small cell carcinoma,Squamous cell carcinoma,D,This patient has typical features of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) secretion which is usually due to a small cell lung cancer commonly seen in smokers. Treatment options are based on the extent of disease ad patient fitness. Other less common causes of ectopic ACTH secretion include bronchial carcinoids.
endocrine system,4,A 68-year-old woman is referred to clinic with elevated plasma calcium and raised PTH. A tentative diagnosis of a parathyroid adenoma is made. Which investigation would you request to assist in localising the parathyroid adenoma?,CT scan,Lateral soft-tissue x ray of the neck,MRI,PET-CT,Radionuclide imaging,E,"Radionuclide imaging with, for example, Sestamibi is used to localise a parathyroid adenoma. Abnormal parathyroid tissue retains Sestamibi after the thyroid tissue has excreted it. The effect is limited where there is multigland disease and should also be correlated with operative findings. Although the other imaging modalities may pick up a parathyroid adenoma, radionuclide imaging has the advantage of localising abnormal parathyroid tissue and guiding minimally invasive surgery."
endocrine system,5,"A 48-year-old man returns from his job running a bar in Tenerife for a holiday to the United Kingdom. He has been suffering increased bony aches and pains, particularly in his knees over the past few weeks and admits to problems in his relationship over the past year or two due to failure to 'perform in bed'. On examination he looks tanned, his BP is 152/90 mmHg, pulse is 75 and regular and he has a BMI of 29. There are signs of chronic liver disease. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 167 g/L (135-177)   White cell count 8.0 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 298 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 4.0 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 90 µmol/L (79-118)   Alanine aminotransferase 90 U/L (5-40)   Fasting glucose 8.4 mmol/L (less than7.0)   Ferritin 640 mcg/L (20-60)    Which of the following is the most likely unifying diagnosis?",Alcoholic liver disease,Haemochromatosis,Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),Type 2 diabetes,Wilson's disease,B,"Haemochromatosis which leads to excess iron deposition is the unifying diagnosis here. Failure of gonadotrophins leads to testosterone deficiency and erectile dysfunction, deposition in the endocrine pancreas leads to diabetes mellitus, and chondrocalcinosis leads to joint pains. The markedly elevated ferritin is a large clue. Alcoholic liver disease may result in many of the features seen, including elevation in ferritin, but the constellation of features is more consistent with haemochromatosis. NASH may also produce an elevation in ferritin and features of cirrhosis, but would be unlikely to produce pigmentation. Wilson's presents at an earlier age and isolated type 2 diabetes would not ordinarily be expected to be associated with features of chronic liver disease."
endocrine system,6,Which of the following does the human testis not secrete?,Inhibin,Oestradiol,Androstenedione,Luteinising hormone (LH),Testosterone,D,"Luteinising hormone (LH) The testis is responsible for secreting testosterone, androstenedione, oestradiol, inhibin as well as a small amount of progesterone.The anterior pituitary produces LH and follicle‐stimulating hormone (FSH). Fructose and prostaglandins that nourish the spermatozoa are secreted by the seminal vesicles."
endocrine system,7,"A patient presents with skin pigmentation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and postural hypotension. What electrolyte abnormality is likely to occur?","Na+ 130, K+ 6.5","Na+ 130, K+ 2.5","Na+ 13, K+ 6.0","Na+ 140, K+ 8","Na+ 130, K+ 1.5",A,"Addison disease is adrenocortical insufficiency due to the destruction or dysfunction of the entire adrenal cortex. It affects glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid function. The onset of disease usually occurs when 90% or more of both adrenal cortices are dysfunctional or destroyed. Hyperpigmentation of the skin and mucous membranes often precedes all other symptoms by months to years. Diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain and postural hypotension are well known features of acute addisons disease. In Addison’s disease there is low Na+, low Cl-, low CO2 and raised K+"
endocrine system,8,A 37-year-old female presents with galactorrhoea. She has a history of dyspepsia for which she receives omeprazole. Examination reveals a BMI of 23.5 kg/m^2 and a small amount of galactorrhoea to expression. Investigations show:    Prolactin 850 mU/L (50-500)   Oestradiol 88 pmol/L (130-500)   LH 3.2 mU/L (3.5-8)   FSH 2.8 mU/L (3-8)    Which disorder should be considered?,Addison's disease,Drug-induced hyperprolactinaemia,Hyperthyroidism,Hypothyroidism,MEN type 1,E,"The presence of hyperprolactinaemia with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism suggests a diagnosis of a microprolactinoma and in combination with the recurrent dyspepsia, a diagnosis of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 1 should be considered. MEN-1 is an autosomal dominant inherited endocrine syndrome which is characterised by parathyroid dysfunction (hyperplasia or adenoma), gastroenteropancreatic tract tumours (gastrinomas, insulinomas, carcinoid), and anterior pituitary dysfunction (e.g. prolactinomas). Cutaneous tumours may also be present, and can act as a marker for the disease. All the findings cannot be explained by omeprazole for which there are some case reports only of hyperprolactinaemia. Addison's disease does not cause hyperprolactinaemia and neither hypothyroidism nor hyperthyroidism would fit this clinical scenario."
endocrine system,9,A known DM was admitted with sudden LOC (loss of consciousness). What is the initial investigation?,CT scan,RBS,MRI,ECG,ABG,B,"In unconsciousness in diabetics, first glycemic change should be excluded by doing RBS"
endocrine system,10,Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG),Is mainly metabolized by serum proteases,Is not produced by non-placental tissues,Is mainly excreted by the kidneys,Levels peak in the maternal plasma at term,Is metabolized by the liver and excreted in bile,C,"HCGMaternal HCG ~100IU/L at the time of the first missed period and peaks at ~100,000IU/L at~10 weeks gestationLevels fall to about 10,000 - 20,000IU/L at 18-20 weeks and remain at this level till termMainly excreted by the kidneys - as a reduced fragment of the beta sub-unit called thebeta-core fragmentMaternal, urinary, placental and amniotic fluid HCG levels at term are higher inpregnancies with a female fetusUseful in the diagnosis and management of trophoblastic disease and ectopic pregnancyHCG is produced by virtually all tissues - pulsatile release from the pituitary gland togetherwith LH - levels may be within the sensitivity of current assays in post-menopausal womenwith very high LH levels. Non-glycosylated therefore very short half life"
endocrine system,11,"A 29-year-old woman presents with a one year history of irregular periods, deteriorating hirsutism, and weight gain. Investigations reveal:    Serum testosterone 4 mmol/L (0.5-3)   Serum dehydroepiandosterone sulphate(DHEAS) 15 µmol/L (0.3-9.3)    Which one of the following statements is most probable for this patient?",Pituitary gonadotrophins are likely to become suppressed,She has an increased risk of multiple pregnancies,She is at increased risk of autoimmune disease,She is at reduced risk of ovarian carcinoma,She is likely to develop acanthosis nigricans,E,"This patient has oligomenorrhoea, weight gain, and hirsutism. The investigations show a modest elevation of androgens and support a diagnosis of polycystic ovarian syndrome. This condition is associated with insulin resistance, increased risk of ovarian cancer and acanthosis nigricans is a feature.   "
endocrine system,12,"A 55-year-old female presents with episodic sweats and tremors which are are relieved by glucose. She has gained approximately 6 kg in weight of late and drinks approximately 10 units of alcohol weekly. Her investigations show normal full blood count, normal urea and electrolytes, and a fasting plasma glucose concentration of 4 mmol/L (3.0-6.0). Which is the most appropriate investigation for this patient?",72 hour fast,CT scan of pancreas,EEG,Insulin and C peptide concentration,Oral glucose tolerance test,A,This patient describes symptoms suggestive of hypoglycaemia which are relieved by carbohydrate. The likely cause is an insulinoma which is producing the weight gain. The standard method for achieving a diagnosis is during a 72 hour fast by demonstration of inappropriately high insulin and C peptide during spontaneous hypoglycaemia. Measurement of C peptide is useful for excluding factitious hypoglycaemia from self injection of insulin. Insulin preparations contain no C peptide. 
endocrine system,13,"A 29-year-old woman brings her 6-week-old child to the new baby clinic at the GP surgery. She is concerned as the child has poor suckling and has been admitted to the Emergency Department on two occasions with possible bowel obstruction but later discharged. She tells you there is a history in the family of a tumour 'syndrome', and one of her relatives died at a young age. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",MEN-1,MEN-2a,MEN-2b,Peutz-Jegher's,Polycystic kidney disease,C,"MEN-2b is one of the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes, and is caused by a mutation in the ret gene on chromosome 10 (many of which are sporadic). Intestinal ganglioneuromatosis affects around 75% of cases. Neuromas involve the autonomic nerves of both the myenteric and submucosal plexi and can cause poor suckling with failure to thrive, constipation, diarrhoea, recurrent pseudo-obstruction, and toxic megacolon. In addition, medullary thyroid carcinoma is a feature of MEN-2b. This metastases in early life, and is therefore often incurable by 4 years of age and leads to early death. Total thyroidectomy is the only established treatment for medullay thyroid carcinoma, the timing of which must take into account risks and benefits for small children. MEN-1 is not associated with mucosal neuromas but is associated with hyperparathyroidism and pancreatic endocrine tumours, as well as pituitary tumours. It is associated with mutation of the menin gene on chromosome 11q13. MEN-2a does not present as early as 2b because of the absence of neuromas. It presents with parathyroid hyperplasia, phaeochromocytomas and medullary carcinoma and is also associated with mutation of the ret gene on chromosome 10. Peutz-Jegher's, whilst being associated with gastrointestinal (GI) hamartomas, presents later in childhood with GI bleeding. Polycystic kidney disease is associated with cerebral haemorrhage, but is not associated with GI tract pathology in infancy."
endocrine system,14,"A 62-year-old man comes to the clinic for review of his diabetes. Current medication includes metformin 1 g BD and 40 units BD mixed insulin. Other medication includes candesartan 16 mg and amlodipine 10 mg. On examination his BP is 155/84 mmHg, his pulse is 70 and regular. His BMI is 31. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 120 g/L (135-177)   White cells 7.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet 192 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L (135-146)   Potassium 5.1 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 127 µmol/L (79-118)   Alanine aminotransferase 110 U/L (5-40)   Alkaline phosphatase 94 U/L (39-117)   HDL cholesterol 0.7 mmol/L (0.8-1.8)   LDL cholesterol 2.4 mmol/L (less than4.0)   Triglycerides 3.2 mmol/L (0.7-2.1)    Which of the following conditions is associated with this clinical picture?",Acute pancreatitis,Autoimmune hepatitis,Chronic pancreatitis,Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH),Unpredictable hypoglycaemia,D,"NASH - hypertriglyceridaemia and raised transaminases are suggestive of increased hepatic fat. Over time it is thought that around 10% of patients who have non-alcoholic steatosis progress to chronic inflammation and NASH. A proportion of these may go on to develop cirrhosis and end stage liver disease, and a smaller proportion of these go on to get hepatocellular carcinoma. Key to the management of NASH is weight loss, which is associated with a reduction in lipid overflow. NB: Candesartan can also cause elevated liver enzymes."
endocrine system,15,What is the mechanism of action of cyanide?,Inhibition of enzyme acetylcholinesterase,Inhibition of enzyme cytochrome oxidase c,Inhibition of enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase,Prevention of mitochondrial replication,Promoting mutations in DNA,B,"Cyanide causes the inhibition of the enzyme cytochrome oxidase c which is an essential part of the mitochondrial electron transfer chain (ETC). It therefore interferes with the basic process of cellular respiration, preventing the formation of ATP and causing rapid cell death. Sarin gas and related agents cause inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, causing levels of acetylcholine to build up in the nervous system causing prolonged sustained contraction of the diaphragm. This hinders and eventually paralyses normal breathing. Arsenic causes inhibition of the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase which is necessary for the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. This also interferes with the basic process of cellular respiration, as pyruvate formed during glycolysis cannot be changed to acetyl CoA to enter the Kreb's cycle. Unfortunately, many agents also cause mutational damage to DNA, so if victims are fortunate enough to survive the initial insult, they may still have significant long term health repercussions. Arsenic and mustards are known for this, and carry risks of skin and haematological malignancy in the longer term. Arsenic can also accelerate atherosclerosis."
endocrine system,16,"A 21-year-old man with known sickle cell anaemia comes to the Emergency Department with increasing shortness of breath which is now so bad that he is unable to walk. He says a few days earlier there were symptoms of a non-specific, mild, flu-like illness but nothing else of note. On examination his BP is 124/72 mmHg, pulse is 95. He has severe left ventricular failure. Blood gas examination reveals a haemoglobin of 64 g/L. Which of the following is most likely to be responsible?",Coxsackie B virus,Cytomegalovirus,Epstein-Barr virus,Influenza A,Parvovirus B19,E,"Parvovirus B19 is known to be associated with aplastic crises in sickle cell anaemia which can precipitate severe anaemia and subsequent cardiac failure. Recovery may be spontaneous over the course of a few weeks, but transfusion, particularly when there is associated cardiac failure, is usually required. Whilst the other viruses listed may contribute to myocardial dysfunction and as such could precipitate cardiac failure, they are not associated with aplastic crisis in sickle cell. Therefore, it is parvovirus which is the only possible correct answer here."

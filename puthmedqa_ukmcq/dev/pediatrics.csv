pediatrics,1,In which of the following types of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a slit-lamp eye examination particularly important?,Enthesitis related arthritis,Oligoarticular arthritis,Polyarticular arthritis,Rheumatoid factor -ve arthritis,Systemic onset arthritis,B,"Chronic uveitis is particularly prevalent in oligoarticular JIA, affecting up to 30%, especially if ANA positive. As it is often asymptomatic initially a slit-lamp examination is essential once oligoarticular JIA is diagnosed. Concerning oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis:  Approximately 1/3 of patients with JIA are affected Four or fewer joints are involved for first six months Onset is during early childhood (2-5 years) Eighty per cent of those affected are girls It affects mainly large joints especially knees, ankles, wrists Joints are often warm, swollen and tender but not erythematous, with mild limitation of movement (if very painful, it is more likely to be an alternate diagnosis) It can present with swelling but no pain Hip involvement at presentation is very rare - look for alternative diagnosis Methotrexate and infliximab are very useful.  Complications include chronic uveitis, which occurs in 30%. It is often asymptomatic and can cause blindness. Ophthalmology follow up is needed for slit lamp examination. ANA positive in 90% - correlates with risk of uveitis. Other blood tests, for example, RF and ESR are usually normal. Active uveitis is treated with steroid eye drops and mydriatics (these cause dilation of pupil). Chronic uveitis can cause poor vision with cloudy cornea and constricted pupil. Leg length discrepancy - increased blood flow to an affected joint causes disproportionate growth. The prognosis is:  Most resolve within six months Twenty per cent who initially do well have recurrence, usually in first year Polyarthritis eventually develops in 20%."
pediatrics,2,"A 6-year-old girl presents with viral symptoms, she has had a cough and coryza for the last two days. Her mother has brought her to hospital as she now has a fever and is very lethargic. Which of the following features would most fit with a diagnosis of meningococcal septicaemia?",Maculopapular rash,Myalgia,Petechiae and purpura,Photophobia,Seizures,C,"There is a spectrum of meningococcal disease that varies from fever to meningitis, from sepsis to death. Most children may have vague symptoms initially of fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, vague rashes, myalgia, and lethargy. In meningococcal septicaemia distinguishing features include:  Petechiae and purpura Hypotension Disseminated intravascular coagulation Renal and heart failure, and Coma.  Meningococcal meningitis, which may or may not co-exist, may present with:  Headaches Photophobia Vomiting Signs of meningism Seizures, or Other focal neurological signs.  "
pediatrics,3,A newborn is diagnosed with an intraventricular haemorrhage. Which of the following is typically associated with this diagnosis?,Congenital toxoplasmosis,Haemophilia,Hyaline membrane disease,Infants of diabetic mothers,Prematurity,E,Prematurity is associated with intraventricular haemorrhages and is thought to be a consequence of vessel fragility. Intraventricular haemorrhage is not usually a presenting feature of haemophilia.
pediatrics,4,Which of the following mechanism does NOT contribute to the development of physiological jaundice in the newborn?,Bilirubin present in breast milk,Increased erythropoeisis produces excess haem,Ineffective erythropoeisis produces excess haem,Meconium facilitates enterohepatic circulation,Relative lack of UDP-glucuronyltransferase,A,"After birth, there is increased erythrocyte turnover and this requires faster action of the enzymes involved in bilirubin metabolism and excretion, often causing a relative lack of UDP-glucuronyltransferase. There can be dysfunctional erythropoeisis resulting in excess haem production which is then metabolised to bilirubin. Meconium contains the enzyme beta-glucuronidase which is normally present in the adult colon bacterial flora and changes the conjugated bilirubin in the bile to an unconjugated form, which is readily reabsorbed in the enterohepatic circulation. Bilirubin is not normally present in breast milk. Breast milk does however contain pregnanediol and non-esterified fatty acids which can act as inhibitors of the conjugation reaction, further slowing the metabolism of bilirubin and allowing unconjugated bilirubin levels in the blood to rise. Physiological jaundice in the newborn is not usually harmful. However, if levels of unconjugated bilirubin rise above 170-200 µmol/l there is a risk of developing kernicterus which can cause seizures and brain damage or death. This is prevented by treating infants with phototherapy at 450 nm. The light disrupts the strong hydrogen bonds which hold together molecules of unconjugated bilirubin allowing the structure to unfold and become more soluble. This facilitates its excretion and reduces serum concentrations."
pediatrics,5,A 5-year-old Malaysian boy presents with a five-day history of fever. Which of the following additional clinical signs would make a diagnosis of Kawasaki disease?,Conjunctivitis and cervical lymphadenopathy,Conjunctivitis and rash,"Conjunctivitis, axillary lymphadenopathy, rash, and cracked lips","Conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, rash, and pansystolic murmur","Conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, rash, and peeling skin on fingertips",E,"Kawasaki disease is an idiopathic condition that is most common in Japanese and children of east Asian and south-east Asian ethnicity. Children aged 6 months to 5 years are most commonly affected, and there is a seasonal peak in the winter and spring. Diagnostic criteria are:  fever lasting for five days  plus four of:  conjunctivitis (bilateral, non-purulent) cervical lymphadenopathy skin rash mucosal changes (e.g., cracked lips, strawberry tongue), or peeling of skin on hands and/or feet following a period of erythema.  It should be noted that Kawasaki disease is often andquot;incompleteandquot; at presentation as features evolve sequentially. Appropriate management may have to be initiated on incomplete cases with a high index of suspicion. Common complications include aseptic meningitis, arthritis, uveitis, and gastroenteritis. Rarely, there can be neurological complications such as ataxia. The most feared complication is coronary artery aneurysm, which occurs in 20-40% of children. Therefore, echocardiogram is required at presentation and two and six weeks later. Treatment consists of intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin, with steroid treatment in selected cases. Of the answer options, only conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, rash, and peeling skin on fingertips meets the diagnostic criteria. Conjunctivitis, axillary lymphadenopathy, rash, and cracked lips, is not correct as the diagnostic criteria specify cervical lymphadenopathy. Conjunctivitis, cervical lymphadenopathy, rash, and pansystolic murmur is incorrect because cardiac murmurs are not part of the diagnostic criteria. However, cardiac murmurs should alert you to a potential cardiac complication. The remaining answer options do not meet the criteria for Kawasaki disease."
pediatrics,6,"A baby girl is born weighing 4.3 kg. At one minute of age, she has acrocyanosis and a pulse rate of 80. She gives a weak cry when stimulated and weakly flexes her legs. She is breathing in gasps. What is her Apgar score?",3,4,5,6,7,C,"The Apgar score was designed by Dr Virginia Apgar in 1952 as a quick scoring system to be performed at one and five minutes, and can be repeated at 10 minutes. There are five components:  A - appearance P - pulse G - grimace A - activity R - respirations.  A low score at one minute may indicate that the baby requires some medical attention. If the Apgar is still low at five or 10 minutes it can be a poor prognostic indicator suggesting the potential for neurological damage. Acrocyanosis - means pink body with blue extremities and scores 1 point for appearance. A pulse of less than100 scores 1 point. A feeble cry when stimulated scores 1 point in grimace. Weak flexion scores 1 point in muscle activity. A score of 2 would occur if flexion was normal and legs resist extension. Breathing in gasps scores 1 point. This gives a total of 5 points."
pediatrics,7,A 6-year-old girl is being investigated for renal failure. She is found to have a congenital abnormality of the insertion of the ureters into the urinary bladder. What is the single most likely cause for renal failure in this patient?,SLE,PKD,Wilm’s tumor,Acute tubular necrosis,Reflux nephropathy,E,Reflux nephropathy is kidney damage (nephropathy) due to urine flowing backward (reflux) from the bladder toward the kidneys; the latter is called vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)
pediatrics,8,"A 3-year-old child is referred to the clinic with intermittent chronic abdominal pain, constipation and behavioural difficulties. He is up to date with vaccinations and has been normal with respect to milestones until the past few months. Apparently he has most recently started joining his father with his hobby (fishing). On examination his BP is 100/60 mmHg, pulse is 85 and regular, he is around the 50th centile for height and weight. He looks pale and you notice a bluish discolouration around his gums. Investigations show:    Haemoglobin 102 g/L (125-160)   White cell count 8.9 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 190 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Sodium 139 mmol/L  (135-146)   Potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Creatinine 114 µmol/L (79-118)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Autistic spectrum disorder,Coeliac disease,Iron deficiency anaemia,Lead poisoning,Mercury poisoning,D,"There are a number of clues which point towards lead poisoning here, including:  Behavioural difficulties The fact his father is a keen fisherman, (with access to lead weights) Presence of blue discoloration around the gums, and Mild anaemia.  Whole blood lead levels are the investigation of choice. Autistic spectrum disorder should not be ruled in when there are clear abnormalities on blood testing, until a systemic medical disorder has been ruled out. Coeliac disease is unlikely as we are not given any history of GI disturbance, nor are we given any history of falling off the centiles. Iron deficiency anaemia is an alternative diagnosis, but would not lead to a blue discoloration around the gums, or to behavioural changes, and there is no history of exposure to mercury."
pediatrics,9,"A 5-year-old child presents with ear pain. This has been present for 24 hours, but she has also complained of mouth discomfort over several weeks. She was born at 41/40 weighing 2.75 kg and there were no neonatal problems. She is fully immunised. The parents are both unemployed and living on income support. On examination she is apyrexial and on the third centile for height and weight. She has black discolouration of six of her teeth, with cavities on the occlusive surfaces of the incisors and inferior molars bilaterally. Ear examination is normal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",Cancrum oris,Dental caries,Periodontal disease,Primary herpes,Stevens Johnson syndrome,B,"The history is of dental caries in a child from a socially disadvantaged background, with pain referred to the ear. Unfortunately sweets are often used as rewards. Bottles of sugary drinks can cause severe caries of the incisors ('bottle caries'). Fluoridation of water is controversial but highly effective in reducing the incidence of this condition."
pediatrics,10,"In an infant, which of the following is unlikely to be found in cardiac failure?",A heart rate of more than 180 per minute,A respiratory rate of more than 30 per minute,An enlarged liver,Ascites,Excessive perspiration,D,"Ascites is rare in cardiac failure in infancy. The following are uncommon clinical features:  Bibasal crackles Raised jugular venous pressure Third heart sound, and Pulsus alternans."
pediatrics,11,In which one of the following conditions would bone age be equal to the chronological age?,Constitutional delay of growth and puberty,Familial short stature,Growth hormone deficiency,Hypothyroidism,Precocious puberty,B,"Bone age is delayed in hypothyroidism. In constitutional delay of growth and puberty all aspects of physiological maturation are delayed, including secondary sexual characteristics and bone age. Growth hormone deficiency will cause delayed skeletal maturation. Precocious puberty will cause advanced bone age. In familial short stature, bone age is equal to chronological age, but linear growth is poor and the child is short."
pediatrics,12,"A 10-year-old boy is brought to the accident and emergency department by his grandmother with a history of cough, fever of 38.2°C, and shortness of breath. His symptoms began eight hours after arrival at his grandfather's horse farm one week ago. He was diagnosed first with pneumonia and treated with azithromycin, but he seemed to get progressively worse especially after playing in the farm. The grandmother denies any allergies and notes that the boy came to stay at the farm the previous year without any health problems. On examination you note an ill-looking boy with mild respiratory distress and bilateral crepitations without wheeze. Blood investigations revealed:    White blood cell count 12 ×10^9/L (7-18)   Neutrophils 8.4 ×10^9/L (3-10)   Lymphocytes 3 ×10^9/L (2-8.5)   Eosinophils 0.48 ×10^9/L (0.1-2)   Basophils 0.12 ×10^9/L (0.0-0.1)   Haemoglobin 121 g/L (115-155)   Platelets 120 ×10^9/L (150-400)   C-reactive protein 15 mg/L (less than5)   IgE antibody 18 (0-63)   Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 30 mm/h (less than13)   Sodium 137 mmol/L (133-146)   Potassium 4.2 mmol/L (3.5-5)    What is the most likely diagnosis?",Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis,Atypical bacterial pneumonia,Cystic fibrosis,Hypersensitivity pneumonitis,Parasitic infection,D,"Hypersensitivity pneumonitis, also called extrinsic allergic alveolitis, is caused by a non-IgE-mediated immunological reaction after exposure to organic dusts such as mouldy hay. Previous sensitisation is necessary and re-exposure will lead to the clinical symptoms. The history in this case is consistent with hypersensitivity pneumonitis and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). However, there are usually other risk factors for ABPA, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis, and atopy. Additionally, the FBC profile in ABPA would show eosinophilia and high serum IgE. Parasitic infections will also show eosinophilia. Atypical bacterial pneumonia can be ruled out because the child did not improve on a macrolide. Although viral pneumonia is more likely here, the sequence of events in this patient is not consistent with simple viral pneumonia."
pediatrics,13,"The midwives have asked you to review a 24-hour-old baby boy who was born at term as there are concerns he looks jaundiced. There were no risk factors for sepsis. There is no family history of jaundice. On examination, the baby appears well but he is jaundiced. There is no organomegaly. Initial blood results show baby's blood group to be A rhesus positive, DCT negative; LFTs and FBC normal. Mother's blood group is O positive. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",ABO incompatibility,G6PD deficiency,Hereditary spherocytosis,Rhesus haemolytic disease,UTI,A,The answer is ABO incompatibility. 
pediatrics,14,A 17-year-old boy is diagnosed with scabies. Which of the following statements regarding scabies is correct?,Is best treated by salicylate emulsion,It can be spread by a droplet infection,It causes itchiness in the skin even where there is no obvious lesion to be seen,It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus,Typically affects the face,C,"Scabies is an infestation of the skin with the microscopic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Infestation is common, found worldwide, and affects people of all races and social classes. Scabies spreads rapidly under crowded conditions where there is frequent skin-to-skin contact between people, such as in hospitals, institutions, child-care facilities, and nursing homes. Scabies can spread by direct, prolonged, skin-to-skin contact, with a person already infested with scabies. Contact must be prolonged (a quick handshake or hug will usually not spread infestation). Infestation is easily spread to sexual partners and household members. Infestation may also occur by sharing clothing, towels, and bedding. Scabies is characterised by papular-like irritations, burrows or rash of the skin, especially the webbing between the fingers; the skin folds on the wrist, elbow, or knee; the penis, the breast, or shoulder blades. A number of treatments are available for the treatment of scabies, including permethrin ointment, benzyl benzoate, and oral ivermectin for resistant cases. Antihistamines and calamine lotion may be used to alleviate itching."
pediatrics,15,"A 4-year-old girl has had a temperature 38.5C for 2 days and has not wanted to eat her food. Yesterday she developed a sore throat and small, painful ulcers inside her mouth. Today she has small blisters on the palms of her hands and soles of her feet which are painful but not itchy. What is the SINGLE most likely underlying cause?",Coxsackie virus,Herpes simplex virus,Staphylococcus aureus,Streptococcus pneumonia,Varicella zoster virus,A,"Patient is suffering from HFMD (Hand,Foot and Mouth Disease). HFMD is due to an infection that usually causes a typical illness, including a typical rash. It is most commonly caused by the Coxsackie A16 virus. HFMD most commonly affects children under 10 years of age. This might include a high temperature (fever). After this, a sore throat commonly occurs, quickly followed by small spots that develop inside the mouth. These soon progress into small mouth ulcers. In many cases, spots also develop on the skin. This is typically a day or so after the mouth ulcers develop. The spots are small lumps that are a few millimetres in diameter and usually appear on the hands and feet, they are not usually itchy but sometimes they can be a little bit sore. Treatment: There is no treatment that will take away the virus"
pediatrics,16,Which one of the following statements is true concerning airway obstruction in the newborn?,Epiglottis is a likely diagnosis,In Pierre Robin syndrome the airway can be improved by a nasopharyngeal tube,Stridor is less severe in the supine position,The commonest cause is subglottic stenosis,Vascular ring can be diagnosed by lateral x ray of the neck,B,"The most common cause of neonatal stridor is laryngomalacia, characterised by low pitched inspiratory stridor. Other causes include unilateral vocal cord paralysis and subglottic stenosis. In Pierre Robin syndrome there is:  micrognathia cleft palate, and glossoptosis, where the tongue falls backwards and downwards.  Glossoptosis can be managed with a nasopharyngeal airway. Epiglottitis is extremely uncommon now following the introduction of Haemophilus influenzae vaccine. Stridor is more severe in the supine position and after agitation/crying. Vascular ring is not diagnosed by x ray, but MRI can be used."

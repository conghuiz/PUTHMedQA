motor system,1,The shape of the pelvic outlet in females,Diamond shaped,Quadrilateral shaped,Oval shaped,Circular shaped,Heart shaped,A,"TRUE PELVISThat part of the pelvis between the pelvic inlet and the pelvic outletThe pelvic inlet is oval in shape in the Gynaecoid pelvis and has the following borders:1) Posterior: Sacral promontory2) Lateral: Iliopectineal line3)Anterior: Symphysis pubisThe pelvic outlet is diamond shaped with the following borders:• Posterior: Coccyx• Lateral: Ischial tuberosities• Anterior: Pubic arch formed by the simphysis pubis and the ischio-pubic rami• Part of the lateral border is formed by the sacro-spinous and sacro-tuberous ligaments which convert the greater and lesser sciatic notches into the greater and lesser sciatic foramina• The pelvic cavity has a shallow anterior wall and a deeper posterior wall. The ischial spines are at the level of the mid-cavity• The acetabulum is formed from the ilium, ischium and pubic bones"
motor system,2,A 5-year-old boy presents to the Emergency department complaining of acute pain over his upper tibia. He is febrile and he refuses to move his leg. A diagnosis of osteomyelitis is suspected. What is the likely infecting organism?,Clostridium difficile,Haemophilus influenzae,Pseudomonas,Salmonella,Staphylococcus aureus,E,"The commonest infecting organism in acute osteomyelitis in children over the age of 4 years is Staphylococcus aureus. With immunisation, cases of haematogenous osteomyelitis due to Haemophilus influenzae have almost been eradicated. Salmonella is the characteristic organism in sickle cell anaemia. Pseudomonas infection is a common organism in haemodialysis patients and intravenous drug addicts."

motor system,4,The scaphoid bone:,Articulates with trapezium and hamate,Articulates with triquetral bone,Has a narrow waist which may fracture,Has a tubercle to which is attached the extensor retinaculum,Is impalpable in the anatomical snuff box,C,"The scaphoid is palpated in the anatomical snuffbox (ASB). It has a narrow waist which is prone to fracture (tenderness in the ASB). This is the most common site of fracture. Clinically, it is important not to miss a fractured scaphoid, as the blood supply is occasionally confined to the distal end, hence a fracture may result in avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment. The scaphoid articulates with the styloid process of radius and the trapezium, although the triquetral is medial to the lunate and hence does not articulate with the scaphoid. The extensor retinaculum is attached laterally to the distal end of radius and medially to the pisiform and the hook of hamate."
motor system,5,"A 10-year-old boy falls whilst running in the school playground, injuring his right forearm. He is tender over his distal radius. An x-ray shows a displaced fracture through the distal epiphysis into the wrist joint with a fragment of metaphyseal bone also broken. How would you classify this injury in the commonly used Salter-Harris classification?",Salter Harris type 1,Salter Harris type 2,Salter Harris type 3,Salter Harris type 4,Salter Harris type 5,D,The Salter Harris classification system for epiphyseal injuries (35% of fractures in children) is one of the most commonly used in orthopaedics. It was first described by Salter and Harris in 1963. A type 1 fracture is through the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate: slipped epiphysis. A type 2 fracture is across the epiphysis with a metaphyseal fracture. A type 3 fracture splits the epiphysis then moves transversely to one side: displaced. A type 4 fracture is similar but extends into the metaphysis. A type 5 fracture is a compression injury.
motor system,6,A 26-year-old man is involved in a road traffic accident where he was an unrestrained front seat passenger. He was flung sideways. He was unable to walk after the accident and has severe left hip pain. His left leg is shorter and adducted. X rays of the pelvis and hips show a posterior dislocation of the left hip. What should be done next?,Admit to ward and wait for space on a trauma list,Arrange urgent CT to determine whether there is an acetabular fracture,Attempt closed reduction in Emergency department using local block,Attempt closed reduction in Emergency department using sedation,Send the patient to theatre immediately for closed reduction,E,"Dislocation of a hip is a true orthopaedic emergency. The longer the patient waits to have his hip put back into socket, the greater the risk of avascular necrosis. Due to the force involved, the hip is very unlikely to be reduced in the Emergency department. The patient must be taken to theatre immediately for closed reduction of the hip under a general anaesthetic."
motor system,7,"A 62-year-old woman presents with a one year history of worsening bilateral, anterior knee pain. The pain is increased by climbing stairs. Both knees are stiff for five to 10 minutes in morning. There is no history of knee swelling. The pain is partially controlled by paracetamol 1 g up to four times a day. She has a history of diabetes, and angina. On examination, she is overweight. There is crepitus and during active and passive movement of both knees. There is no knee effusion. A recent knee x ray shows joint space narrowing in the medial tibio-femoral joint. What is the next step in her management?",Acupuncture,Oral NSAIDs,Rest,Topical NSAIDs,Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS),D,"This lady has osteoarthritis. NICE guidelines recommend formulating individualised management plans for patients with osteoarthritis. Behavioural change, such as exercise, weight loss and suitable footwear should be encouraged. Comorbidities which compound the effect of osteoarthritis symptoms should be identified and their treatment optimised. Paracetamol and/or topical NSAIDs (for knee or hand OA) should be offered before considering oral NSAIDs. If symptoms are not controlled with the above strategies, oral NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors (but not etoricoxib) can be used. A proton pump inhibitor should be co-prescribed. The lowest effective dose should be prescribed for the shortest period possible. If the patient is already taking low-dose aspirin, an alternative analgesic should be considered. Treatments which are not recommended include rubefacients, intra-articular hyaluronan, electro-acupuncture and chondroitin or glucosamine products. Adjuvants which can be used include opioid analgesics, topical capsaicin and intra-articular corticosteroids. Application of heat or cold packs, or TENS, can be considered if other strategies are ineffective. Manipulation and stretching can be helpful, particularly for hip osteoarthritis. Bracing/joint supports can be used for patients with biomechanical joint pain or instability. Patients should be referred for joint surgery if they have already been offered all of the core treatments or if they have refractory joint symptoms which have a substantial impact on their quality of life. If there is a clear history of mechanical locking, referral for arthroscopic lavage and debridement should be considered. "
motor system,8,Which muscle of the lower limb is primarily responsible for knee extension?,Quadriceps,Peroneus longus,Extensor hallucis longus,Tibialis anterior,Iliopsoas,A,"The quadriceps muscle is mainly responsible for knee extension.The quadriceps femoris insertion into the patella is through a common tendon with a three‐ layered arrangement: most superficially rectus femoris, vastus medialis and lateralis in the intermediate layer and in the deepest layer vastus intermedius."
motor system,9,An 18-year-old rugby player is brought to the emergency department with a painful right shoulder sustained when he fell awkwardly during a tackle. On examination there is fullness in the deltopectoral groove and lowering of the anterior axillary fold. The acromion process appears to be prominent. His arm is slightly abducted and externally rotated. What is the most likely diagnosis?,Acromioclavicular joint subluxation,Anterior dislocation of the shoulder,Fracture of the acromion process,Fracture of the greater tuberosity of the humerus,Posterior dislocation of the shoulder,B,"Anterior (subcoracoid) dislocation is the commonest type of shoulder dislocation (this is in contrast to the hip, where posterior dislocation is the most common). The usual mechanism of injury is a fall onto the outstretched arm when the arm is abducted and externally rotated. It can also result from various sporting injuries, commonly basketball and rugby. Pain is severe and the patient is unwilling to attempt movements of the shoulder. A swelling may be noticed in the deltopectoral groove (displaced head) with an undue prominence of the acromion process. The arm is held in slight abduction and external rotation. There may be flattening and loss of contour of the shoulder just below the acromion process and lowering of the anterior axillary fold. If the axillary nerve is damaged patients may present with loss of sensation over the upper, outer aspect of the arm (regimental badge area). Posterior dislocation of the shoulder, although uncommon, may occur as a result of direct blow to the shoulder joint causing the humeral head to be displaced from the glenoid cavity. It may result from violent trauma such as an electric shock or an epileptic convulsion. The arm is usually held (or fixed) in internal rotation (note: external rotation in anterior dislocation), which cannot be rotated outwards even as far as the neutral position. The normal shoulder contour is lost and the anterior aspect of the shoulder appears flat (in contrast to fullness in anterior dislocation)."
motor system,10,Which one of these muscles inserts onto the superior medial tibial shaft (pes anserinus)?,Adductor magnus,Iliopsoas,Piriformis,Sartorius,Semimembranosus,D,"Sartorius, gracilis and semitentinosus insert onto the of the superior medial tibial shaft, close to the tibial tubercle (pes anserinus). Adductor magnus inserts onto the linea aspera and adductor tubercle of the femur. Semimembranosus inserts onto the posterior aspect of the medial tibial condyle. Iliopsoas inserts onto the lesser trochanter of the femur. Piriformis inserts onto the greater trochanter."
motor system,11,Which of the following is correct concerning the knee joint?,Capsule is thick anteriorly and posteriorly but thin around the collateral ligaments,Fibular collateral ligament is separated from the lateral meniscus by the semitendinosus tendon,Is a synovial and a hinge joint,"On cross section, the lateral meniscus is deeper compared with the medial meniscus",The cruciate ligaments are extracapsular,C,"The knee joint is a synovial (and a hinge) joint. The capsule of the knee joint is thin anteriorly and posteriorly but reinforced on either side by strong collateral ligaments. On the sides of the femur, the capsule attachment extends up to the epicondyles. Both the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments are intracapsular. The medial and lateral menisci are C-shaped with their anterior and posterior horns attached to the intercondylar eminence of the tibia and their outer borders to the joint capsule. The menisci differ in size and shape, the medial being narrower though slightly larger so that its horns embrace those of the lateral meniscus. Also, the medial is attached to the medial collateral ligament and on cross section is deeper compared with the lateral meniscus. On the lateral side of the knee joint, the cord-like fibular collateral ligament descends from the lateral epicondyle of the femur to the styloid process and head of the fibula, separated from the lateral meniscus by the popliteus tendon."
motor system,12,A 74-year-old woman is undergoing a left total knee replacement. Which of the following measures reduces the risk of prosthesis infection?,Alcohol cessation two weeks prior to surgery,Covering all open wounds with an occlusive dressing,Laminar air flow in theatre,Shaving the operation site the day before surgery,The surgeon double gloving,C,"Joint replacement surgery should not be considered in patients with open wounds. Cessation of smoking at least two weeks before surgery reduces prosthesis and wound infection rates. Hair should be removed from the operative field with clippers immediately before surgery, shaving the day before surgery causes an increased release of skin commensals. Laminar flow air hoods reduce the number of bacteria in the air above the wound. The antibiotic impregnated cement reduces the rate of deep infection."
motor system,13,An elderly lady presents with problems performing simple tasks such as buttoning blouses or holding the phone. She has wasting of the small muscles of the hand and partial clawing of the little and ring fingers. Which nerve is likely to be damaged?,Radial nerve,Axillary nerve,C6,Median nerve,Ulnar nerve,E,"The ulnar nerve passes through the wrist in the ulnar canal, also known as Guyons canal. This is the most common site of a lesion compressing the ulnar nerve. Compression is often the result of a ganglion or swelling after a fracture."
motor system,14,An unconscious patient is brought into the Emergency department as an emergency. He has been assaulted with a hammer by an unknown individual. An emergency CT scan reveals an extradural haematoma. The CT reveals a fracture through the right pterion. Which blood vessel has bled?,Anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery,Maxillary artery,Middle cerebral artery,Posterior auricular artery,Posterior branch of the middle meningeal artery,A,"The pterion is an area of the cranium where the frontal, parietal, temporal and sphenoidal bones meet. It is the weakest part of the skull. It is significant clinically as it overlies the anterior branch of the middle meningeal artery, which is a branch of the maxillary artery. Maxilary artery injuries occur following facial bone or maxilary injuries.  Posterior auricullar artery injury occurs following neck or ear trauma.  Middle cerebral arteries are often involved in stroke. "
motor system,15,Which of the following is true regarding the obturator internus muscle?,Forms the roof of the ischiorectal fossa,Has a fascia on its pelvic surface which gives origin to the levator ani,Is innervated by the femoral nerve,Is inserted onto the lesser trochanter of the femur,Leaves the pelvis through the obturator foramen,B,"Obturator internus is one of the muscles of the lateral pelvic wall extending into the gluteal region. It arises from the inner surface of the obturator membrane lining the obturator foramen and the neighbouring surfaces of the pubis and ischium. From this broad surface, it narrows down as it passes posterolaterally to form a tendon that traverses the lesser sciatic foramen. Just inferior to the ischial spine it turns laterally. There is a bursa interposed between the tendon and the bone at this point. Passing laterally, it inserts into medial surface of the greater trochanter of the femur. It lies between superior and inferior gemili and acts to externally rotate the hip joint. The roof of the ischiorectal fossa is formed by the levator ani. It is innervated by the nerve to obturator internus (L5, S1), a branch of the sciatic nerve. The obturator internus fascia gives origin to the levator ani."
motor system,16,"A 53-year-old lady who is a keen rambler is out walking and twists her ankle. She is unable to weight bear and is brought to her local Emergency department. An x ray is taken which shows a fracture of the distal fibula around the ankle mortice, with movement of the talus. Which classification system is commonly used to classify this type of fracture?",Evans classification,Garden classification,Gartland classification,Neer classification,Weber classification,E,Weber's classification is based on the level of the fibular fracture.  A type A fracture occurs below the syndesmosis of the tibia and fibula. A type B fracture is at the level of the syndesmosis. A type C fracture is above the syndesmosis.  The others are  Gartland's classification is related to supracondylar fractures of the humerus. Neer's classification is for proximal humeral fractures. Garden's classification is for proximal (intracapsular) fractures of the hip. Evans' classification is for inter-trochanteric (extracapsular) fractures of the hip.

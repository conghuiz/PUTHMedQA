hematological system,1,A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with haemophilia A. His uncle on his mother's side also has the same condition although his mother is well. The parents of the boy are worried about their next child suffering with the same condition. What is the chance of the next child having the disease?,0%,25%,50%,75%,100%,B,"Haemophilia is an X-linked disease. In this scenario we are not told that the father has the disease, therefore, he must have a 'healthy' X chromosome. The mother's brother is affected - i.e. she is the carrier and has one affected X chromosome and one 'healthy'. She will pass the affected chromosome to 50% of her daughters (meaning one in two will be a carrier) and 50% of her sons (meaning one in two will be affected by the disease) - i.e. one in four of her children will be affected by the disease, and one in four will be a carrier. The sex of the next child it is not mentioned in this question. The overall chance of the next child having the disease will be 25% and phenotypically normal child will be 75%."
hematological system,2,A 22-year-old Greek man presents with rapid anemia and jaundice following treatment of malaria. He is noted to have Heinz bodies. Choose the single most likely cause from the given options?,G6PD deficiency,Anemia of chronic disease,Pernicious anemia,IDA,Vit B12 deficiency,A,"G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) deficiency exacerbated by administration of oxidant drugs (e.g., primaquine, dapsone, quinidine). In active G6PD deficiency, Heinz bodies can be seen in red blood cells on a blood film"
hematological system,3,"A 42-year-old man presented with tiredness, breathlessness, and nose bleeds for three weeks. On examination, there were several bruises on his arms and legs, 2 cm splenomegaly and fundal haemorrhages. Investigations revealed:    Haemoglobin 72 g/L (130-180)   White cell count 13.8 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelet count 24 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Blood film White cells predominantly myeloblasts and promyelocytes    Which one of the following investigations would be of most prognostic value?",Bone marrow trephine biopsy,Cerebrospinal fluid examination,Morphology,Cytogenic karyotype,Immunophenotyping,D,"Cytogenetic evaluation of malignant haematological cells may have important implications for the prognosis and treatment options in acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). For example, t(8;21) confers a good prognosis in adult AML, and about 70% of patients in this low-risk group can be cured with intensive chemotherapy alone, radiotherapy being reserved for patients who relapse. Trephine biopsy gives a architectural view of the marrow and aids diagnosis.  CSF examination is used in leukaemias or lymphomas with risk of extranodal or CNS involvement. Immunophenotyping or flow cytometry help to chategorise and diagnose leukaemias based on their cell surface expression of various proteins.  Morphology is used to view the aspirate to make quick diagnostic decisions where treatment is needed urgently, i.e APML."
hematological system,4,Which of the following is thought to be useful in reducing pain crises in sickle cell anaemia?,Hydroxychloroquine,NSAIDs,Hydroxyurea,Methotrexate,Azathioprine,C,Hydroxyurea is thought to reduced the number of painful crises in sickle cell anaemia.
hematological system,5,A patient is referred to the haematology clinic due to a slightly elevated platelet count which has been repeated several times during the year. She is very well and states she has no PMH but had an operation as child although she is unsure of what this was for. Her Haemoglobin and white cell count is normal. A blood film does not show giant platelets or platelet clumps but does reveal Howell Jolly bodies. How would you investigate next?,Tumour markers,Repeat history and examination for indication of a splenectomy,Haematinics,Bone Marrow Biopsy,Septic screen,B,This patient has most likely had a splenectomy given the history of previous intra abdominal surgery and Howell Jolly bodies which appear post splenectomy. Post splenectomy there may be a slight elevation of platelet count or white cell count. It is unlikely to be a reactive thrombocytosis given the fact it has been elevated for one year and she is otherwise well.
hematological system,6,Which of the following statements is true of sickle cell disease?,A painful shoulder joint will respond to intra-articular corticosteroid injection,Oral iron supplements are required,Symptoms of anaemia are usually limiting when haemoglobin equals 80 g/L,There is often an inability to concentrate urine,The spleen is frequently enlarged,D,"A urine concentrating defect is quite common in sickle cell anaemia, has its onset in early childhood, and may be reversible with prevention of sickle crises. The inner medulla is hypoxic, hypertonic and acidotic and therefore predisposes to sickling of red blood cells, which results in vasoocclusion and reduction in renal medullary blood flow. Associated haematuria increases venous pressure, which can worsen renal medulla ischaemia. Clinical manifestations depend on the predominant site of tubule involvement: proximal tubule dysfunction impairs urinary concentration, whilst more distal dysfunction impairs potassium excretion. There is a tendency to iron overload in sickle cell disease and therefore iron therapy is not usually indicated. The spleen is decreased in size after six months of age, due to repeated episodes of venoocculsion and infarction, and patients often have functional hyposplenism and are recommended to take daily penicillin. The anaemia associated with sickle cell disease is usually only symptomatic below 70 g/L, as oxygen is released more readily from erythrocytes. Intra-articular steroids have been associated with a sickle cell crisis, the mechanism of which is not fully understood, but they should be avoided."
hematological system,7,A patient on warfarin is found to have an INR of 5.4. He is not on any other medication and is asymptomatic with no signs of bleeding. His warfarin was withheld. The following day his INR was 6.2. There is no signs of bleeding. How do you manage this?,1 mg of vitamin K,Prothrombin complex concentrate,Berliplex,10mg of vitamin K,Withhold warfarin,E,Patients with high INRs with no evidence of bleeding do not require any reversal of warfarin. His INR is likely elevated on the second day as there tens to be a 48 hour lag and still does not require reversal but warfarin should be withheld. It can be difficult to re warfarinise someone when vitamin K is given.
hematological system,8,A 40-year-old lady presents with a swollen right calf. She has a history of mental health problems and is on a number of medications. Which of the following treatments increases the risk of thromboembolism?,Antipsychotics,Benzodiazepines,Monoamine oxidase inhibitors,Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,Tricyclic antidepressants,A,The oral contraceptive and antipsychotics are possible causes of thromboembolism. 
hematological system,9,A 45-year-old man is to undergo knee surgery. He has a history of factor IX deficiency. You are concerned about the prospect of significant bleeding during surgery. Which of the following is most likely to reduce his risk of bleeding?,Mefenamic acid,Tranexamic acid,Vasopressin,Vitamin K,von Willebrand factor,B,"Tranexamic acid competitively inhibits activation of plasminogen, thereby reducing the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. This results in slower degradation of fibrin clots, fibrinogen and other plasma proteins including factors V and VIII. As such it may be of value in patients undergoing surgery who have inherited factor IX deficiency in order to reduce the perioperative risk of bleeding. Recombinant factor IX is of course also an option where it is available, although patients have a high tendency to form neutralising antibodies to factor IX. Vasopressin is associated with a significant increase in levels of both factor VIII and von Willebrand factor in haemophilia A. Any increase seen in factor IX levels after vasopressin is however much more minor. As such tranexamic acid is a much more useful therapeutic choice. None of the other options given has any role in the management of factor IX deficiency."
hematological system,10,In which of the following is the prognosis in Hodgkin's disease worse?,Associated with alcohol-induced pain in chest lymph nodes,Female gender,Histology shows lymphocyte depletion,Onset is in late adolescence,Presentation is with normal body temperature,C,"Alcohol-induced pain in chest lymph nodes is a clinical feature but it is not related to poor prognosis. The main poor prognostic indicators are:  Advanced stage Older age Lymphocyte depleted histology Relapse in less than one year B symptoms, and Male sex.  The Rye classification:  Lymphocyte predominant, 2-10% cases, excellent prognosis Nodular sclerosing, 40-80%, very good prognosis Mixed cellularity, 20-40%, good prognosis Lymphocyte depleted, 2-15%, poor prognis.  The younger the age of onset the better the prognosis. Symptoms are fever, sweats, and greater than10% weight loss in six months."
hematological system,11,"A 45-year-old Chinese man is found incidentally to have a severely hypochromic and microcytic blood picture, with Hb 112 g/L. He is asymptomatic. Which of the following is the most discriminatory investigation?",Barium enema,Bone marrow biopsy,Gastroscopy,Haemoglobin electrophoresis,Ham test,D,"This patient is most likely to have thalassaemia trait. He has severely microcytic, hypochromic cells but is asymptomatic with a relatively normal haemoglobin. If this were iron deficiency we would expect a much lower haemoglobin, with at least some symptoms. Beta-thalassaemia trait is associated with minor suppression of beta-chain manufacture and a microcytic hypochromic anaemia, where the MCV is surprisingly low for the level of haemoglobin (which is usually over 90 g/L). An elevated HbA2 (+/- HbF) is a useful marker of this trait. Alpha-thalassaemia trait results in a more complex clinical picture, as four chains control alpha-chains. The milder cases manifest with microcytosis without anaemia, whereas the more severe case have a microcytic anaemia with splenomegaly and HbH in red cells. The Ham test is used to diagnose paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, which this presentation is not consistent with."
hematological system,12,Which of the following statements concerning abnormalities of the haemoglobin molecule is true?,Alpha thalassaemia is due to a deficiency of beta-chain production,Genes for the alpha and beta chains are located on the same chromosome,HbS is caused by a single base mutation on the beta-chain,"In thalassaemia, persistence of HbF is an adverse prognostic sign",Oligonucleotide probes may assist in the diagnosis of haemoglobinopathies in adolescents,C,"Alpha thalassaemia is due to abnormalities of the alpha chain. Persistence of HbF has survival advantages in severely affected subjects. Alpha is located on 16, beta on 11. Hb electrophoresis is used in the adult, rather than oligonucleotide probes as used in the fetus."
hematological system,13,A 60-year-old man has a pathological rib fracture. He also complains of recurrent infection. BMA (bone marrow aspiration) is done. Labs: Ca2+ 3.9 mmol/L and ALP 127 U/L. what type of cell would be found in abdundance in the marrow smear?,Plasma cell,Myeloid cell,Bence-jones protein,Megakaryocytes,Reticulocytes,A,"The diagnosis is multiple myeloma. i) age 60 yrs ii) pathological rib fracture (from metastases) iii) recurrent infection (dueto B cell dysfunction (manifested as hypogammaglobulinemia), numerical and functional abnormalities of T cells, and dysfunction of natural killer cells), iv) raised calcium level. There are abundant plasma cells in the bone marrow"
hematological system,14,"A 27-year-old woman with a family history of bleeding disorder comes to the obstetric clinic for review. She is completely well, but her maternal uncle and brother suffer from bleeding into joints and after tooth extractions. She is 20 weeks pregnant with her first child, which has been confirmed as male on ultrasound scan. The pregnancy has been unremarkable so far. Routine blood testing is normal apart from her activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), which is prolonged at 55 seconds (25-40). What is the chance of her child suffering from the bleeding disorder?",0%,25%,33%,50%,100%,D,"The inheritance pattern here suggests an X-linked recessive bleeding disorder and therefore raises the possibility of haemophilia A. Although women who carry one copy of the abnormal gene do not generally suffer from increased bleeding tendency, there may be biochemical evidence with prolongation of the APTT. Because the value here is outside the normal range, it is likely she carries the gene for haemophilia A. She has a 1 in 2 chance of passing the gene on to a male child. Because it is X-linked, the child would be affected if he inherited one copy of the gene. 0% represents the approximate percentage chance of female offspring suffering from increased bleeding tendency. Case reports do exist that female haemophilia carriers do occasionally suffer from increased bleeding risk. If the APTT was not known, then we would assume a 50% chance of her carrying the abnormal gene, giving a 25% chance of her male child inheriting the condition."
hematological system,15,A regular donor reports yellow discoloration of his eyes and fevers five days after a blood donation. What would be the next most appropriate course of action for the blood bank medical officer?,Platelets are safe to be released in this situation,Recall blood products from this donor and arrange for retesting of this donor,Release all the blood products from this donor if initial testing is negative,Selected blood products such as red cell packs may be released as these have a small volume of plasma,The donor needs to be struck off the donor register,B,"Depending on the complications developed by the donor an assessment must be made on how to manage the donor as well as the blood products from the donation. In this case, the blood products must be recalled till further testing and clarification of the donor illness. Release of one or any of the blood products must be prevented. The donor need not be struck off the register at this stage till further testing results are available."
hematological system,16,"You are asked to urgently review a 32-year-old woman who is receiving a blood transfusion following a postpartum haemorrhage which occurred after the birth of her second baby. Apparently, she required a three unit blood transfusion after the birth of her first child. A short time after the transfusion began she became acutely short of breath, with saturations of only 91% on air, and severe wheezing. On examination she is pyrexial 37.8°C, her BP is 110/60 mmHg, her pulse 89 and regular. She has marked bilateral wheeze on auscultation of her chest. Investigations reveal:    Haemoglobin 104 g/L (11.5-16.0)   White cell count 8.3 ×10^9/L (4-11)   Platelets 179 ×10^9/L (150-400)   Serum sodium 138 mmol/L (135-146)   Serum potassium 3.7 mmol/L (3.5-5)   Serum creatinine 100 μmol/L (79-118)   CXR Bilateral pulmonary infiltrates   PaO2 8.4 kPa (10-13)   PaCO2 5.2 kPa (4.8-6.1)    Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",Acute haemolytic transfusion reaction,Acute non-haemolytic transfusion reaction,Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema,IgE mediated transfusion reaction,Transfusion associated lung injury,E,"Transfusion associated lung injury (TRALI) occurs in patients who have received a multi-unit blood transfusion, commonly plasma, and then further transfsion is given with associated lung pathology i.e chest sepsis. Two hypotheses are proposed for the cause of TRALI, that it is either  Due to HLA antigens in the donor blood reacting with neutrophil antigens in the patient, leading to neutrophil migration to pulmonary capillaries   or that  The neutrophils responsible do not actually require donor HLA antigens to react, and are just primed by infection, surgery or inflammation.  What is common to both hypotheses though, is that the neutrophils lead to a local release of cytokines, increased capillary permeability, and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, accounting for the presentation with wheeze and hypoxia which is seen here."

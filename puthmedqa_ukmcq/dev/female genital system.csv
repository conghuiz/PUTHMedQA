female genital system,1,A 25-year-old school teacher has come to see you in antenatal clinic. She is at 10 weeks of gestation in her first pregnancy. Her partner is known to have glucose 6-phosphatase deficiency. She is otherwise fit and healthy. She has been tested negative for the condition. What is the risk of her child being a carrier for the same condition?,2:04,4:04,1:04,3:04,0:04,A,"Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is inherited in an X-linked pattern.All female children of a G6PD deficientmale will inherit the trait but none of his male children can inherit the trait from him. Thus, a male can only inherit this enzyme deficiency from his mother."

What your management?,Nothing to do,Packed RBCS,FFP,Platelets transfusion,Cryoprecipitate,C,FFP administration has to follow the transfusion of 4 packed RBCs units
female genital system,3,A 29 year old patient goes into labour. She has had an uneventful pregnancy with normal antenatal ultrasound scans. You are called to see the patient as fresh vaginal bleeding started when the membranes ruptured spontaneously. You suspect vasa previa. What is the fetal mortality associated with vasa previa when it is not diagnosed in the antenatal period?,1%,3%,25%,60%,90%,D,Vasa Previa typically presents with PV bleeding at the time of rupture of membranes (may be spontaneous or artificial).Studies have shown approximately 40% of vasa previa cases are diagnosed antenatally. In the group diagnosed antenatally and ideally delivered by cesarean delivery at 35 weeks of gestation or earlier the fetal survival rate is around 97% whereas in the group not diagnosed antenatally survival has been quoted at 44% (mortality at 55-60%). Vasa Previae Key PointsRefers to unprotected fetal vessels running below presenting part of fetus over the cervical os. Incidence is 1 in 2000-6000 pregnancies Typically presents at time of membrane rupture with fresh PV bleeding and fetal heart abnormalities. Fetal mortality is around 60%
female genital system,4,"A 34-year-old woman comes to the Emergency department GP complaining of intermenstrual bleeding, particularly after sexual intercourse, pain on intercourse and intermittent severe right iliac fossa pain. In the last month she was admitted to the Emergency department with suspected appendicitis but later discharged. On examination she is pyrexial 37.9°C and there is bilateral lower abdominal tenderness. Speculum examination reveals cervicitis and mucopurulent cervical discharge. Which of the following represents the most appropriate antibiotic regime?",Ceftriaxone 500 mg IM then doxycycline 100 mg BD and metronidazole 400 mg BD for 14 days,Cephalexin 500 mg BD and metronidazole 400 mg PO BD for 14 days,Metronidazole 400 mg PO BD for 7 days,Metronidazole 400 mg PO BD for 14 days and ciprofloxacin 500 mg BD for 14 days,Ofloxacin 400 mg BD for 7 days,A,"This patient has symptoms consistent with pelvic inflammatory disease, which may be sexually transmitted and due to either Chlamydia or gonorrhoea. Antibiotic treatment should not wait for swab or culture results and be commenced once the diagnosis is made. Current guidelines for the outpatient treatment of pelvic inflammatory disease recommend ceftriaxone 500 mg IM STAT, followed by oral doxycycline 100 mg BD and metronidazole 400 mg BD for 14 days. Referral to a GUM clinic should be considered to arrange screening across the range of possible sexually transmitted infections. Long term sequelae include possible tubal scarring and subfertility. "
female genital system,5,"Of the following, which is true concerning the development of the genital system?",Mullerian inhibiting substance stimulates the paramesonephric duct,The paramesonephric ducts develop from coelomic epithelium on the urogenital ridge,Mullerian inhibiting substance (MIS) is secreted by the ovary,The sex of the embryo is determined at the ninth week of development,Only female embryos initially have two pairs of genital ducts,B,"The sex of the fetus is determined at fertilisation, however the gonads do not obtain male or female status until week seven of development.Male and female embryos have both mesonephric and paramesonephric ducts. MIS is secreted by testicular Sertoli cells and causes regression of the paramesonephric duct."
female genital system,6,What does NICE advise pregnant diabetic women should keep their HBA1C below?,6.1% or 43mmol/mol,7.0% or 53mmol/mol,7.8% or 62mmol/mol,6.5% or 48mmol/mol,10.0% or 86mmol/mol,D,"6.1% is the old target from NICE guideline 63. This guidance was replaced by NICE guideline 3 in February 2015.The current recommendation is to keep HBA1C below 6.5% or 48mmol/mol Diabetes In Pregnancy NICE updated its guidance on management of diabetes in pregnancy in 2015. The current guidelines advise the following regarding management including new HBA1C targets:Advise women with diabetes who are planning to become pregnant to aim to keep their HbA1c level below 48 mmol/mol (6.5%), if this is achievable without causing problematic hypoglycaemia.Reassure women that any reduction in HbA1c level towards the target of 48 mmol/mol (6.5%) is likely to reduce the risk of congenital malformations in the baby.Strongly advise women with diabetes whose HbA1c level is above 86 mmol/mol (10%) not to get pregnant because of the associated risks."
female genital system,7,Regarding the rash below which of the following statements is true?,Most cases require treatment with oral steroids,It is associated with multiple gestation pregnancies,It is associated with Rh-negative blood types,Recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies are approximately 25%,It is known to run in families,B,This rash is Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (PEP or PUPPP). It is a benign and typically self limiting condition so treatment is aimed at symptom relief. This can usually be achieved with emollients +/- topical steroids/antihistamines. In severe cases oral steroids can be considered. It is not directly associated with birth complications and generally has an excellent prognosis. It is most common in women during their first pregnancy with recurrence rates in subsequent pregnancies around 7%.Associations include:Multiple gestation pregnancies Excessive maternal weight Rh-positive blood type
female genital system,8,"A 30 year old woman presents to colposcopy clinics having had a cervical smear showing low grade dyskaryosis and positivity for high risk HPV infection. She has no relevant past medical history. She has a family history of her maternal aunt and grandmother both dying from cervical cancer. She smokes ten cigarettes per day and has recently broken up with her partner. Her children are aged 13, 6 and 2 years old. Her BMI is 36. She has regular periods and no postcoital bleeding and no vaginal discharge. She is on depo provera for contraception. What is the most appropriate advice regarding her management?",Have a cervical biopsy only,Have a colposcopy and if no abnormalities are seen have a repeat cervical smear at that point,Have an excisional biopsy using LLETZ or other technique,Have a hysterectomy if her family is complete,Have a colposcopy and biopsy of any abnormalities revealed,E,A repeat cervical smear at colposcopy would not add any beneficial information. A cervical biopsy only may not sample the abnormal areas of the cervix. A hysterectomy without confirmed diagnosis is not a viable option. An excisional biopsy may be a viable option if high grade colposcopic abnormalities are revealed. A colposcopy needs to be performed first.
female genital system,9,You see a 45-year-old nulliparous woman at your gynaecology clinic who is a carrier for the BRCA2 mutation. She wishes to discuss surgery to reduce her cancer risk. What is the approximate average cumulative risk of her developing ovarian-type cancer by the age of 70?,20%,35%,40%,55%,70%,A,"BRCA1 and BRCA2 are highly penetrant genes that account for 95% of families with both breast and ovarian cancer. The cumulative risk of ovarian cancer is lower in women with BRCA2 at 20%, compared with BRCA1 where the risk is 39%"
female genital system,10,"In uterine smooth muscle, the calcium‐ATPase pump transports calcium out of the cell. Which of the following transport mechanisms facilitates this?",Simple diffusion,Active transport,Osmosis,Facilitated diffusion,Exocytosis,B,"The intracellular concentration of calcium is much lower than the extracellular concentration.When calcium enters the cell, it is travelling from a high to low concentration through voltage gated calcium channels, which open in response to depolarisation of the cell membrane.In this instance, we are asking about transport out of the cell, against the concentration gradient.Calcium ions are pumped out, but this requires energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP).This is an example of active transport.There is some simple diffusion of calcium across the membrane, but only in order to enter the cell."
female genital system,11,A 44-year-old woman complains of heavy bleeding per vagina. Transvaginal US (ultra sonography) was done and normal. Which of the following would be the most appropriate investigation for her?,Hysterectomy,Endometrial biopsy,CBC,High vaginal swab,Coagulation profile,E,"Transvaginal US is normal i.e. no endometrial hyperplasia, no fibroid or obvious cause for heavy bleeding was found. So now most appropriate investigation should be coagfulation profile"

female genital system,14,A 28 year old woman has been sent to the ward by her GP as she has had some per vaginal bleeding (spotting) and a positive urine pregnancy test. Her bleeding has resolved and she is clinically stable. An ultrasound scan confirms a tubal ectopic pregnancy. The patient wants to speak to you regarding management options. You check the ultrasound to see what the mean diameter of the ectopic pregnancy is. At what mean diameter would you advise medical management with methotrexate is no longer appropriate?,≥15mm,≥20mm,≥25mm,≥30mm,≥35mm,E,"Medical management of tubal ectopic with methotrexate should only be considered if the mean diameter of the ectopic measuresMedical management of tubal pregnancy with methotrexate can be considered if the mean diameter of the ectopic pregnancy isTubal Ectopic Pregnancy Background11,000 ectopic pregnancies in the UK each year Ectopic pregnancy occurring in about 11 in 1000 pregnancies. Maternal Mortality rates for ectopic pregnancy in the UK are 2 per 1000 (0.2%)DistributionThe majority of ectopics are tubal with non-tubal ectopics accounting for only 3-5% of ectopic pregnancies. The typical distribution is shown below.Tubal 93-95% Interstitial 2-5% CervicalOvarianAbdominalHeterotopicTubal ectopic pregnancyTubal pregnancies can be further subdivided into:Ampullary section 70-80% Isthmus 12% Fimbrial 5-11% Cornual and interstitial part of the tube 2%Selection criteria for expectant managementWoman is clinically stable and pain free Ectopic pregnancyNo evidence of significant haemoperitoneum / blood in the pouch of Douglas Initial serum hCG level below 1500 iu/l and decreasing at follow up Success rates of 57-100%Selection criteria for methotrexate treatmentWomen is clinically stable without significant pain Ultrasound confirms no intrauterine pregnancy and mean diameter of ectopic isSerum hCGWilling to attend follow upMethotrexate treatmentTreatment with a single dose IM methotrexate (50mg/m²) is often successful without recourse to surgery 14% (range 3-27%) of women require 2 or more doses of methotrexateLaparoscopic salpingectomy or salpingotomyThe majority of tubal ectopic pregnancies are managed surgically"
female genital system,15,"You are asked to review a 36 year old woman in a joint obstetric–renal clinic who is currently 16 weeks pregnant into her second pregnancy. She had an uncomplicated caesarean section at term for breech presentation 13 years ago. She was diagnosed with reflux nephropathy and has been on haemodialysis for last 2 years. There is no other medical and surgical history of note. She is not a smoker. Currently she is on calcium and vitamin D supplements, erythropoietin injection and pregnancy vitamins. Her BMI at her booking visit is 20. Her BP is 120/78 mm Hg and she is not on any antihypertensives. A recent blood test showed: haemoglobin = 102 gm/l serum potassium level = 4.8 mmol/l serum creatinine level = 210 micromol/l serum urea level = 10 mmol/l eGFR = 10 ml/min/1.73m2 normal bone profile normal plasma bicarbonate levels urine protein creatinine ratio: 95. Which of the following statement is most appropriate in her case regarding pregnancy outcome and management?",Duration of haemodialysis must be increased to more than 20 hours/week for improved outcome,Dialysis is usually associated with oligohydramnios,Maintain serum urea at 25–30mmol/L,Chance of successful pregnancy outcome is 30% with both haemodialysis and CAPD (continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis),Pregnancy rate is approximately 1 in 400 women per year,A,"The disadvantages of almost daily haemodialysis may include hypocalcaemia, alkalosis and hypokalemia. Conversely, an increased dialysis frequency will allow for a more liberal diet and protein intake, improving the nutritional status.Pregnancy outcomes are improved when the sessions are prolonged to 4 hours, occurs six times a week, the fluid removal is limited to 400 ml per session, and the predialysis serum creatinine is maintained at 4.5 mg/dl (397.8 micromol/l) or serum urea less than 15 20 mmol/'.Note that:The chance of successful pregnancy outcome is 50% with both haemodialysis and CAPD. Poor prognostic features includes age >35 years, more than 5 years on dialysis, delayed diagnosis of pregnancy leading to late increase in dialysis timesDialysis is associated with polyhydramnios related to uraemia The aim is to maintain serum urea at less than 15–20mmol/l Pregnancy rate is approximately 1 in 200 women per year."
